            "content": "Abbott Laboratories's ABT short percent of float has risen 3.1% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 22.93 million shares sold short, which is 1.33% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.93 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nAbbott Laboratories Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Abbott Laboratories has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Abbott Laboratories's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Abbott Laboratories's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.23%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is stepping up testing for heavy metals in infant formula and reviewing key nutrients required in these products, federal health officials said.\n\n\"The FDA will use all resources and authorities at its disposal to make sure infant formula products are safe and wholesome for the families and children who rely on them,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in a statement.\n\nKennedy recently met with top executives from formula makers, including Abbott Laboratories, which produces Similac, and Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Enfamil, according to a social media post from HHS.\n\nThe FDA will also conduct a comprehensive review of infant formula nutrients while ramping up testing for heavy metals and other contaminants, CBS News reported. The actions are being dubbed Operation Stork Speed.\n\n\"The FDA is deeply committed to ensuring that moms and other caregivers of infants and young children and other individuals who rely on infant formula for their nutritional needs have confidence that these products are safe, consistently available, and contain the nutrients essential to promote health and well-being during critical stages of development and life,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Sara Brenner said in a statement.\n\nThe action dovetails with the findings of a Consumer Reports investigation released Tuesday, which found potentially harmful chemicals\u2014including acrylamide, arsenic, BPA, lead, and PFAS\u2014in nearly half of the 41 infant formula products tested.\n\nSome products had low or no levels detected.\n\n\"We look forward to seeing the details of how they intend to implement the plan, and we hope the FDA is providing adequate resources and staffing to actually follow through with these promises,\" Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement.\n\nConcerns about infant formula safety have been heightened since 2022, when FDA inspections found bacteria linked to two infant deaths at Abbott's Sturgis, Mich., plant.\n\nThe plant's temporary closure led to a nationwide formula shortage, causing stress for millions of families who depend on formula to feed their babies.\n\nRoughly one in five newborns in the U.S. start on formula, making it a crucial source of nutrition in the first months of life.\n\nMore information: The Cleveland Clinic has more on heavy metal poisoning (toxicity).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 HealthDay.

            "content": "In the latest market close, Abbott (ABT) reached $127.42, with a +0.89% movement compared to the previous day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.08%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.92%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.41%.\n\nThe maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs's stock has dropped by 2.98% in the past month, falling short of the Medical sector's gain of 0.21% and outpacing the S&P 500's loss of 8.26%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Abbott in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.07, reflecting a 9.18% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $10.39 billion, up 4.28% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $5.15 per share and a revenue of $44.35 billion, signifying shifts of +10.28% and +5.73%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Abbott. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Abbott is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nLooking at valuation, Abbott is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.55. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.29 of its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that ABT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.36. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Medical - Products industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.13.\n\nThe Medical - Products industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 142, which puts it in the bottom 44% of all 250+ industries.",

Abbott Nutrition is a pharmaceutical company and division of Abbott Laboratories.. Credit: JHVEPhoto/Adobe Stock\n\nWith Formula Verdict Tossed, What\u2019s Next for NEC?\n\nA Missouri judge who last year sanctioned Abbott\u2019s lead counsel in a high-stakes trial over cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula has tossed out the subsequent defense verdict in that case, citing \u201cwidespread misconduct\u201d on the part of the defendants.\n\nA quick backgrounder: The Oct. 31 verdict is the only defense win in the litigation alleging cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula, provided to premature babies in hospitals, has caused NEC, a gastrointestinal illness that causes long-term illness or death. Another manufacturer, Mead Johnson, lost the first trial last year after an Illinois jury awarded $60 million in St. Clair County Circuit Court. Months later, a jury in 22nd Judicial Circuit Court in St. Louis, Missouri, awarded $495 million against Abbott.\n\nThe sanctions: 22nd Judicial Circuit Judge Michael Noble, in an Oct. 24 order, found that James Hurst (Kirkland & Ellis) had committed \u201cbad faith on several occasions.\u201d He barred Abbott\u2019s lead counsel from presenting closing arguments at the trial.\n\nNew trial: In his March 13 order, Noble granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, citing many of the same instances that led to his sanctions against Hurst. Both Abbott and Mead Johnson plan to appeal his order.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The ruling comes as other infant formula trials are coming up. One trial involving four kids who got sick is coming up in June in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois. And, in the multidistrict litigation, in the Northern District of Illinois, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer has scheduled four bellwether trials. The first one, set for May 5, involves a baby who was fed Abbott\u2019s Similac cow\u2019s milk-based product while in a West Virginia hospital, where she died at 16 days old.\n\n\n\nGerald \u0094Jerry\u0094 Singleton, with Singleton Schreiber.

The firms represent individuals and businesses with damages caused by the Eaton fire, which destroyed nearly 10,000 structures and killed 17 people.\n\nAlso: The judge approved a separate leadership team for government entities, such as Los Angeles County and the cities of Pasadena and Sierra Madre, which all sued earlier this month. Baron & Budd partners John Fiske and Torri Sherlin, and Diab Chambers partners Ed Diab and Kristen Barton will lead those cases. More than 100 insurance firms also have sued Edison, and those lawyers in leadership are: Jordan Everakes (Grotefeld Hottman), Amanda Stevens (Schroeder Loscotoff), Howard Maycon (Cozen O\u2019Connor) and Matthew Delinko (Bauman Loewe).\n\nStill unclear: Two class actions filed by Lawyers for Justice and DiCello Levitt. Steven Jodlowski (DiCello Levitt) wrote in his firm\u2019s class action:\n\n\u201cThe damages or other financial detriment suffered by plaintiffs and the other class members are relatively small compared to the burden and expense that would be required to individually litigate their claims against defendants, so it would be impracticable for the class members to individually seek redress for defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristopher Seeger of Seeger Weiss.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, in the Northern District of California, who in 2021 severely reduced the common benefit fund from an estimated $800 million, rejected a special master\u2019s recommendation to grant $0. Chhabria, while acknowledging a \u201cdegree of unfairness\u201d his March 13 order would have on lawyers who did not rely that much on lead counsel\u2019s work, called the distribution of common benefit fees \u201cfar from an exact science.\u201d\n\nPoppi Settlement: The makers of Poppi\u2019s Prebiotic Sodas have asked a federal judge in the Northern District of California to approve an $8.9 million settlement in a consumer class action over the advertised health benefits of the popular drinks. The settlement, outlined in a March 14 motion for preliminary approval, gives class members 75 cents per can of Poppi, and up to $9 per 12- or 15-pack, with a minimum claim amount of $5 per household. On March 17, PepsiCo announced plans to purchase Poppi for $1.95 billion.\n\nBuzbee Sued: Tony Buzbee (Buzbee Law Firm) was hit with a lawsuit from a former client accusing him of embezzling funds from his $700,000 settlement. Buzbee, who has sued rapper Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, said the suits are retaliation for representing clients against celebrities. The March 10 suit, filed by former client Jose Bermudez in Harris County District Court in Texas, said Buzbee stole money from a settlement with Callan Marine involving a 2020 injury he suffered while working as a seaman on its vessel.",

F.D.A. staff members are also bracing for further Trump administration personnel reductions.\n\nAnd at the Agriculture Department, a committee studying deadly bacteria was recently disbanded, even as it was developing advice on how to better target pathogens that can shut down the kidneys.

            "content": "(March 19): Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is taking on baby formula products, the latest in his sweeping review of ingredients used in the US food supply.\n\nUnder Kennedy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will begin a comprehensive examination of the nutrients used in infant formula and increase testing for heavy metals and other contaminants, the HHS said in a statement on Tuesday. The announcement comes as Kennedy met with executives of companies that make infant formula, Bloomberg first reported.\n\nKennedy held a discussion with the chief executives from Abbott Laboratories, which makes Similac, Enfamil maker Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Perrigo Co and Bobbie Baby Inc, according to a social media post from the HHS.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the secretary, the FDA, and the scientific and medical communities to continue to make infant formulas even closer to breastmilk and support the aims of Operation Stork Speed,\u201d Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said in an email. \u201cEach ingredient in our formulas is purposefully chosen for the type of baby we are feeding and their unique dietary needs.\u201d\n\nAbbott shares had fallen 1.1% at 3.42pm in New York after paring earlier losses on Tuesday. Reckitt, whose Mead Johnson unit makes formula, lost 1% in London.\n\nContamination concerns\n\nKennedy previously voiced concerns about the presence of heavy metals in formula products, including in a social media post in May 2024. During his presidential campaign, he said that if he were to be elected, the FDA, a part of the HHS that he now oversees, would examine formula ingredients.\n\nThe announcement on Tuesday comes as formula manufacturers are facing increased scrutiny over ingredients and potential contaminants in their products. Popular infant formula brands made by Abbott and Reckitt\u2019s Mead Johnson unit, among others, were found to contain potentially concerning levels of heavy metals, according to new findings released on Tuesday after the HHS statement.\n\nThe study, from non-profit group Consumer Reports, revealed Abbott\u2019s EleCare Hypoallergenic and Similac Alimentum products had the highest levels of inorganic arsenic among the 41 powdered formulas tested. Reckitt\u2019s Enfamil Nutramigen had, in some cases, twice the amount of lead as other products tested.\n\n\u201cTo get to zero exposure would be very, very tough because all these things are found in soy and rice and lipids \u2014 all the materials that make up protein,\u201d said Josef Neu, a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of Florida\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThat being said, I am always concerned about any kind of toxins that we might be feeding the baby if it\u2019s breast milk, donor milk, formula. I think that the companies should really be looking at this.\u201d\n\nAbbott and Reckitt both said in statements that their products are safe, that they test them for heavy metals, and that they are in compliance with standards set in other countries given the FDA has yet to set heavy metal limits for infant formula.\n\nToxic metals such as lead and arsenic are naturally occurring and can be found in water or soil that may enter the food supply chain during the manufacturing process. It\u2019s unclear what the potential health impacts might be \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time formula manufacturers were faced with contamination concerns.\n\nThe US encountered major shortages of baby formula in 2022 after infant deaths were linked to a bacteria called Cronobacter sakazakii. Abbott had to shut down a Michigan factory after Cronobacter was found in the plant, leading to an interruption in supply.\n\nAbbott and Reckitt have also faced lawsuits over claims that the companies hid potential risks of formula for infants born prematurely. Kyle Diamantas, the new acting director of the FDA\u2019s food division, defended Abbott in some of those lawsuits in his role as an attorney at the law firm Jones Day, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe FDA released a long-term strategy earlier this year to help boost the resiliency of the US infant formula supply.\n\nKennedy, a lawyer who was tapped to head the HHS after joining US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, has put his sights on foods that are ultra-processed or contain artificial dyes. He has said that he plans to investigate their links to chronic diseases, a key point in his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda.\n\nThe health secretary met last week with women who support him who he calls \u201cMAHA moms\u201d, according to a social media post. He also met with food industry executives to pressure them to remove artificial dyes from their products.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against other best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nThe Growing Market and Innovation in Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Technology\n\nThe WHO estimates that 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, with the majority residing in low- or middle-income countries. On average, diabetes directly contributes to 1.5 million deaths annually. Over the past few decades, there has been a steady rise in both the prevalence and the number of cases of diabetes. Nonetheless, the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 500 million people worldwide presently have diabetes, and that figure is predicted to increase by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045.\n\nOne medical device used to assist manage diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is the continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The market has grown dramatically in recent years, and it is currently a rapidly expanding category of diabetes care equipment. The demand for advanced diabetes care goods, including insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) equipment, was estimated by GlobalData to be worth $21.8 billion in 2023. GlobalData projects that the market will reach $33.4 billion in revenue by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34%.\n\nThe GlobalData marketed products database shows that there are currently 97 products in the CGM category. Most of these devices are standard CGMs, with only a few being implanted sensors. 133 products are either approved or in the development stage, according to the GlobalData pipeline products database. The research indicates that this market niche is expanding quickly and is a hub for innovative new technologies like implantable CGMs.\n\nToday, CGM technology incorporates AI. For example, Roche introduced Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a cutting-edge CGM gadget driven by predictive AI. At the launch, Julien Boisdron, Chief Medical Officer for Roche Diabetes Care, called it \u201ca solution more than a CGM.\u201d He described how the system, which consists of two algorithms and a sensor, aids in data visualization and prediction.\n\nThe Rise of GLP-1 Drugs: Opportunities, Growth, and Challenges\n\nA new era of opportunity has arrived for the management of diabetes and its associated complications. These novel strategies can effectively treat the co-occurring conditions of obesity and diabetes. A class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists is used to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). By 2030, the GLP-1 market, which is equally driven by obesity and diabetes, is expected to grow to $100 billion. About 9% of Americans, or 30 million people, may be GLP-1 users by this point.\n\nTwelve percent of adult Americans report having taken a GLP-1 drug at some point, according to the most recent KFF Health Tracking poll. In the previous five years, 22% of patients with a diagnosis of obesity or overweight also took GLP-1, while 43% of patients with diabetes had the drug. Adults who have heard \u201ca little\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about these medications have gone from 70% to 82% over the past year, while those who have heard \u201ca lot\u201d about them have increased from 19% to 32%.\n\nHowever, problems have arisen due to the increased demand for these diabetes and weight-loss medications. An \u201cexplosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online\u201d is a potential threat, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). Semaglutides, which are sold under the brand name Ozempic, help persons with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar. However, in other countries, like the US, where they are sold under the name Wegovy, they are also commonly used to help people lose weight. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated:\n\n\u201cPharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list, we selected diabetes-related stocks from the HRTS GLP-1, Obesity, and Cardiometabolic ETF, as well as the EDOC Telemedicine and Digital Health ETF. We then ranked these stocks based on the number of billionaire investors holding stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024, prioritizing those with the highest billionaire ownership.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 11\n\nDollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $1,939,020,330\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) specializes in medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. In diabetes care, its flagship FreeStyle Libre system, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, eliminates the need for routine finger pricks.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) remains a top diabetes stock, with its diabetes care segment serving as a major growth driver. In Q4 2024, sales from this division reached $1.8 billion, marking a 23% year-over-year increase, while full-year CGM sales totaled $6.5 billion, reflecting 22% growth. The FreeStyle Libre franchise continues to dominate the CGM market, with the company expanding its portfolio through innovations like the Lingo CGM system.\n\nFinancially, the corporation delivered a strong Q4 2024 performance, with total sales reaching $11 billion, reflecting a 7.2% increase on a reported basis and 10.1% organic growth (excluding COVID-19 testing sales). The Medical Devices segment grew by 14%, fueled by demand for diabetes care and structural heart products. Diagnostics sales rose 6%, led by a 16% increase in rapid diagnostics, while nutrition sales climbed 7%, with Ensure generating over $3 billion annually.\n\nThe company\u2019s profitability remained strong, with adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $1.34 and operating cash flow totaling $8.5 billion. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reinvested in capacity expansions while returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Looking ahead, the company forecasts organic sales growth of 7.5%\u20138.5% for 2025 and adjusted EPS between $5.05 and $5.25. Key drivers include the continued expansion of FreeStyle Libre CGM systems, the launch of new products like the GridX mapping catheter, and strong momentum in structural heart devices, including MitraClip and TriClip.\n\nOverall, ABT ranks 8th on our list of best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Abbott (ABT).\n\nAbbott currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.56, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.56 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68% and 8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ABT\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Abbott here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Abbott, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ABT Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Abbott, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.15.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Abbott. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Abbott.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This tailored approach to nutrition recognizes that standardized solutions are often insufficient, as each person's nutritional needs are influenced by their biological makeup and personal circumstances. Personalized vitamins aim to optimize health by providing a customized balance of essential vitamins and nutrients, prevent disease by addressing nutritional deficiencies and supporting overall health, enhance performance for athletes and fitness enthusiasts, and aid in weight management by promoting metabolic health.The applications of personalized vitamins are extensive, including nutritional assessments that evaluate dietary habits, health history, and lifestyle factors to develop tailored supplementation plans. Some solutions integrate genetic testing to customize supplements based on genetic predispositions and nutritional requirements, while others leverage gut microbiome analysis to refine personalized nutrition strategies. Personalized vitamins are available in various formulations and delivery methods, including capsules for multivitamins and targeted nutrients, powders for protein supplements and nutrient shakes, liquids for improved intake among children or the elderly, and soft gels for omega-3 and fat-soluble vitamins, which may enhance absorption and bioavailability.List of Prominent Players in the Personalized Vitamins Market:\u2022 BASF SE\u2022 Abbott Laboratories\u2022 Amway Corporation\u2022 Bayer AG\u2022 Caligenix\u2022 Care/of (Bayer)\u2022 DayTwo Inc.\u2022 DNA Fit\u2022 GX Sciences\u2022 DSM, Nutrigenomix Inc.\u2022 Elysium Health\u2022 Genomix Nutrition\u2022 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)\u2022 GNC Holdings Inc.\u2022 Habit Food Personalized LLC\u2022 Lonza\u2022 Inside Tracker\u2022 LifeDNA\u2022 Metagenics, Inc\u2022 Nature's Bounty Co.

Shares of the company have risen 12.7% compared with the 9% growth of the industry during the same time frame. The S&P 500 Composite has increased 10%.\n\nWith healthy fundamentals and strong growth opportunities, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company appears to be a solid wealth creator for its investors at the moment.\n\nAbbott discovers, develops, manufactures and sells a diversified line of healthcare products. The company has four reportable segments, namely, Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products and Medical Devices. Its Established Pharmaceuticals Division includes the branded generics business in emerging markets and its Medical Devices segment includes the diabetes care, vision care and vascular businesses. Within the Diagnostics segment, Abbott manufactures and markets diagnostic systems and tests in four business lines \u2014 core laboratory, molecular, point of care and rapid diagnostics. Meanwhile, the Nutrition business includes a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products.\n\nFactors Favoring ABT\u2019s Share Price Growth\n\nAbbott\u2019s share price is trending upward, prompted by the strong prospects within the Core Diagnostics business. The company continues to expand its Diagnostics business foothold. It is witnessing increased global demand for its routine diagnostic. It is particularly gaining from strong demand for its portfolio of respiratory disease tests.\n\nIn rapid and point-of-care diagnostics businesses, the company is successfully expanding its test menus and is also capitalizing on the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional healthcare settings. In lieu of this, rapid diagnostics sales (excluding COVID-19 testing sales) increased 16% year over year. Additionally, the Core Laboratory Diagnostics business grew 4%, driven by continued strong demand for Abbott\u2019s immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels. This increased optimism among investors and is expected to contribute further.\n\nInvestors showed optimism about Abbott\u2019s growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based, continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users. Of late, the company is fast gaining momentum, leveraging consistent upgrades of FreeStyle Libre.\n\nAbbott\u2019s sales recovery within the Nutrition business looks encouraging. The business consistently demonstrates strong growth and market share gains. The overall Nutrition business is particularly expanding on strong global demand for the company\u2019s adult nutrition products like Ensure and Glucerna.

            "content": "Reckitt logo. Credit: Below The Sky/Shutterstock\n\nReckitt Benckiser\u2019s Mead Johnson unit and Abbott Laboratories have been ordered to face a new trial in the US over allegations their premature infant formula can cause a serious gut condition.\n\nIn October, a court in Missouri had cleared the companies. The decision to re-open the trial was taken by Missouri Circuit Judge Michael Noble in St. Louis on Thursday (13 March).\n\nAs reported by news agency Reuters, Judge Noble said the defendants\u2019 lawyers had engaged in misconduct that resulted in an unfair verdict from the jury and ordered a new trial.\n\nUK-listed Reckitt described the re-opening of the trial as being \u201cat complete odds with the law and the facts\u201d. It said it will appeal.\n\nThe original trial saw the companies face allegations that they failed to warn a mother about the risks of their specialised baby formulas for premature infants.\n\nA claim filed by the Whitfield family related to the life-threatening intestinal disease necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which can affect premature babies fed with specialised formulas.\n\nThe trial judge ruled against the family, potentially setting a precedent for other NEC-linked cases which were said to be pending.\n\nIn a statement at the time Reckitt said: \u201cToday\u2019s verdict is consistent with the scientific consensus that there is no established causal link between the use of specialised pre-term hospital nutrition products and NEC, and that where human milk is unavailable or when supplementation is necessary, specialised pre-term hospital nutrition products can provide essential, life-saving nutrition.\u201d\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s ruling, Judge Noble said Abbott and Mead Johnson\u2019s lawyers intentionally and repeatedly violated clear instructions when presenting evidence to the jury, Reuters reported.\n\nIn its statement following the re-trial announcement, Reckitt said \u201cnothing the court has now cited justifies disregarding the jury\u2019s determination\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe unanimous jury verdict in October supports our view that we have the science, the law, and the facts on our side. Moving forward, plaintiffs continue to face significant challenges due to the heavy burden they must meet in proving each element of the claims in every single case. Mead Johnson will continue to vigorously defend itself against all other cases in the interest of safeguarding the health of premature babies.\u201d\n\nReckitt pointed out any new trial would not take place until after the appellate process is exhausted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the appellate process, the jury\u2019s original decision will either be reinstated, or the case will head back to the lower court for a new trial,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a statement sent to Just Food, Abbott spokesperson Scott Stoffel said: \u201cTwelve citizens of the city of St. Louis served on a jury for five weeks, heard all the evidence, including from leading experts and unanimously found that Abbott\u2019s formula does not cause NEC.\n\n\u201cTheir verdict was correct. It was consistent with the consensus of scientists, governmental regulators and the neonatologists who treat these vulnerable patients in intensive care units every day. We are disappointed by the court\u2019s extraordinary decision to set aside the jury\u2019s work. We plan to file an immediate appeal, and we expect that the jury\u2019s verdict will be reinstated.\u201d\n\nLast week, Reckitt said it was continuing to assess options for its nutrition operations housing the Mead Johnson infant-formula business.\n\nAfter describing nutrition as \u201cnon-core\u201d in July as part of a strategic review, Reckitt confirmed that it plans to \u201cexit\u201d the business unit.\n\nThe consumer goods giant is moving its focus away from nutrition and the essential home division to concentrate on its \u201ccore\u201d or so-called \u201cpower brands\u201d within the consumer health and hygiene categories.\n\nReckitt acquired Mead Johnson in 2017 for $17.9bn.",

            "content": "In the last year, many Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Abbott Laboratories\n\nThe Executive VP & Group President of Medical Devices, Lisa Earnhardt, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$106 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$127. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 27% of Lisa Earnhardt's stake.\n\nIn the last year Abbott Laboratories insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNYSE:ABT Insider Trading Volume March 17th 2025\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Abbott Laboratories shares. In total, insiders dumped US$886k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Abbott Laboratories insiders own about US$1.0b worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",

            "content": "The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Abbott Laboratories ( ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 86% over five years, which is below the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 9.7%.\n\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Abbott Laboratories achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 30% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nWe know that Abbott Laboratories has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Abbott Laboratories will\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Abbott Laboratories, it has a TSR of 104% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nAbbott Laboratories provided a TSR of 12% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 15% per year. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Abbott Laboratories a stock worth watching. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Abbott Laboratories better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies DiaSorin S.p.A. ( ) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is DiaSorin's Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that DiaSorin had debt of \u20ac962.0m at the end of December 2024, a reduction from \u20ac1.12b over a year. However, it does have \u20ac344.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about \u20ac618.0m.\n\nHow Healthy Is DiaSorin's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that DiaSorin had liabilities of \u20ac266.4m due within a year, and liabilities of \u20ac1.22b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of \u20ac344.0m and \u20ac228.7m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling \u20ac917.7m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nOf course, DiaSorin has a market capitalization of \u20ac5.09b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nWe'd say that DiaSorin's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.7), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 16.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Also good is that DiaSorin grew its EBIT at 15% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if DiaSorin can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, DiaSorin recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 96% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nThe good news is that DiaSorin's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! It's also worth noting that DiaSorin is in the Medical Equipment industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. Looking at the bigger picture, we think DiaSorin's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. We'd be very excited to see if DiaSorin insiders have been snapping up shares. If you are too, then\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The case had been a victory for the two companies following large losses in similar trials that had rattled investors.\n\nMissouri Circuit Judge Michael Noble in St. Louis, Missouri, said the defendants\u2019 lawyers had engaged in misconduct that resulted in an unfair verdict from the jury and ordered a new trial.\n\nAbbott and Reckitt said they would appeal.\n\nAbbott spokesperson Scott Stoffel said the jury had reached the correct decision, based on evidence from scientists and governmental regulators who have said there is no conclusive link between preterm infant formula and the plaintiff\u2019s son\u2019s intestinal disease.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the court\u2019s extraordinary decision to set aside the jury\u2019s work,\u201d Stoffel said.\n\n\u201cThis decision is at complete odds with the law and the facts, and we will appeal,\u201d Reckitt said in a statement Friday.\n\nShares in Reckitt were down 2.8%, and those in Abbott fell 2.9% at 1440 GMT.\n\nNoble said Abbott and Mead Johnson\u2019s lawyers intentionally and repeatedly violated clear instructions when presenting evidence to the jury. The defense attorneys \u201cflooded the zone\u201d with objections, presented evidence that the judge had previously disallowed, and confused the jury by attacking \u201cstraw man\u201d arguments and saying that babies would \u201cstarve to death\u201d if the products were pulled from the market, according to Noble\u2019s ruling.\n\nOne of Abbott\u2019s lawyers was sanctioned at one point during the trial, and he was not allowed to present evidence or make arguments during the latter half of the five-week trial.\n\n\u201cThe misconduct in this case was appalling, and we certainly felt it led to an unfair trial and unjust result for our client,\u201d said attorney Tim Cronin, who represented the plaintiff, a young boy named Kaine Whitfield, and his mother.\n\nAt the five-week trial in St. Louis, Missouri state court, lawyers for plaintiff Kaine Whitfield had urged jurors to award more than $6.2 billion.\n\nThe case is one of about 1,000 similar lawsuits around the country, which have raised alarm from doctors who say the litigation could threaten the formulas\u2019 availability or affect medical decisions.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the companies failed to warn that their specialized formulas used by newborn intensive care units in hospitals could cause necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nIt is a disease that almost exclusively affects premature infants and has an estimated mortality rate of more than 20%.",

Their growing demand is fueled by increasing consumer preference for plant-based protein sources and their role in sustainable agriculture.

Furthermore, the concentration of a huge population base in India and China is increasing demand for nutritious food, leading to an increase in overall pulse production.\n\nPulses help to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the human body. As a result, they are frequently consumed worldwide. In the short term, the coronavirus pandemic was predicted to create a minor delay. Despite a little slowdown caused by COVID-19, economic expectations remain generally optimistic.\n\nAs concerns over excessive meat consumption on human health dawn on consumers, they are seeking healthier alternatives. Resultantly, the market for pulses is witnessing a notable upsurge nowadays. Furthermore, the trend of healthy eating has augmented, with consumers hoping to strengthen their immunity by eating fiber, nutrient, and vitamin-rich foodstuffs. Therefore, growth prospects of the global pulses market appear largely optimistic throughout the 2020-2030 assessment period.\n\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30! https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/pulses-market\n\nLandscape for the Pulses Market\n\nNestle SA, Groupe Danone, Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB), Abbott Laboratories Inc., Vitasoy International Holdings Ltd, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd., Coca-Cola Co, General Mills Inc., Blue Diamond Growers, Kikkoman Corporation, Dr. Sch\u00e4r AG/SpA, Lactalis Groupe, Valio Oy, Post Holdings Inc., and Monde Nissin Corp. among others are some of the major players in the global pulses market.\n\nMarket players can face stiff competition from alternative protein sources such as soybeans, hemp, flax, nuts, and oilseed.

            "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories' Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, Abbott Laboratories has grown EPS by 25% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Abbott Laboratories maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.6% to US$42b. That's progress.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nNYSE:ABT Earnings and Revenue History March 12th 2025\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Abbott Laboratories.\n\nAre Abbott Laboratories Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Abbott Laboratories, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.1b. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.",

Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $10.39 billion, showing a 4.28% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $5.15 per share and revenue of $44.35 billion, indicating changes of +10.28% and +5.73%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Abbott should also be noted by investors.

            "content": "Abbott (ABT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Abbott falls in, has lost 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAbbott is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.15 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.73 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Abbott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Abbott is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Abbott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $44.35 billion and $47.51 billion estimates indicate +5.7% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAbbott reported revenues of $10.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. EPS of $1.34 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.02 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.45%. The EPS surprise was 0%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Abbott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAbbott is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Abbott. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms.

            "content": "Abbott's ABT diversified business portfolio is well-positioned to drive momentum. However, the international business environment continues to be challenging globally. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nFactors Driving ABT Shares\n\nAbbott continues to expand its Diagnostics business foothold (23% of the total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024). Over the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing increased global demand for routine diagnostics (excluding COVID-19 testing sales). In the fourth quarter of 2024, rapid diagnostics, excluding COVID-19 testing sales, increased 16% year over year. Core Laboratory Diagnostics' growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for Abbott\u2019s immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Diabetes Care business continues to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, in Diabetes Care, sales of CGM exceeded $1.8 billion and grew 23%. For full-year 2024, sales of CGM were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22% from 2023. This included growth of 27% in the United States.\n\nWithin Abbott\u2019s Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, the company is also strategically progressing with its advancement in biosimilars. Abbott, leveraging on its leading presence in emerging markets, is enjoying a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital-efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to the emerging market population. The first round of commercialization is on track for 2025. The company is highly optimistic about this initiative, considering the fact that biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Price\n\nAbbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories Quote\n\nOver the past three months, shares of ABT have gained 21.3% compared with the industry\u2019s 5.4% improvement. The company\u2019s consistent efforts to expand in high-growth areas, as well as its array of new product launches are expected to help the stock continue its uptrend in the coming days.\n\nConcerns Remain for Abbott\n\nForeign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott because a considerable percentage of its revenues comes from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has been hampering the company\u2019s performance in the international markets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on sales.\n\nThe challenging macroeconomic scenario in the form of the ongoing complex geopolitical situation globally, specifically where Abbott operates, is driving a higher-than-anticipated increase in expenses in terms of raw materials and freight. These could also result in broader economic impacts and security concerns, affecting the company\u2019s business in the upcoming months. Industrywide, it has been seen that the deteriorating global economic environment is reducing demand for several MedTech products, resulting in lower sales and lower product prices while increasing the cost of goods and operating expenses of the businesses of the MedTech companies.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Abbott incurred an 8.5% increase in the cost of products sold (excluding amortization expense). The gross margin contracted 55 basis points to 55%.

            "content": "Dublin, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Neurological Biomarkers Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Neurological Biomarkers Market was valued at USD 8.70 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 13.91 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 8.10%. This market represents a dynamic and rapidly advancing segment within the healthcare and life sciences industry. Neurological biomarkers are essential tools used for diagnosing, monitoring, and researching neurological disorders that affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by factors that highlight the critical role of biomarkers in modern medicine and research. The sector is expected to continue its expansion, influenced by increasing prevalence of neurological disorders, advances in biomarker discovery and validation, and a growing aging population. As neurological conditions become more widespread, the demand for early, accurate diagnostic tools has surged, fueling market growth.\n\n\n\nKey Market Drivers\n\nIncreasing Prevalence of Neurological Disorders\n\n\n\nThe growing incidence of neurological disorders globally plays a significant role in shaping the Neurological Biomarkers Market. As conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries become more common, the need for advanced diagnostic tools, early detection methods, and precision treatment solutions has risen. Neurological biomarkers are critical in meeting these needs and driving market growth. These disorders are major contributors to disability and mortality worldwide, affecting over one in three individuals. In 2021, stroke was identified as the leading cause of health loss among the top neurological conditions. This rising disease burden has emphasized the need for early and accurate diagnostic solutions, thereby increasing the demand for neurological biomarkers.\n\n\n\nThe global aging population has resulted in an increase in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's. The global dementia population is expected to nearly double every 20 years, reaching 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050. A large proportion of this growth is expected in developing countries, where dementia prevalence is rapidly rising. Currently, 60% of dementia cases occur in low- and middle-income nations, with this figure projected to rise to 71% by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for expanded healthcare infrastructure, diagnostic capabilities, and intervention strategies in these regions. Biomarkers are increasingly incorporated into diagnostic protocols to detect Alzheimer's at early or pre-symptomatic stages.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, approximately one million individuals are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), and this number is expected to increase to 1.2 million by 2030. As the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's, Parkinson's presents a growing public health challenge, driving demand for advanced diagnostics, early detection, and innovative treatment solutions. Additionally, approximately one in four adults worldwide is at risk of experiencing a stroke, with over 12 million individuals expected to have their first stroke this year, leading to an anticipated 6.5 million fatalities.\n\n\n\nMore than 100 million people globally are living with the long-term effects of stroke, highlighting the urgent need for improved prevention, early detection, and treatment options. Neurological biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B are widely used in stroke detection and brain injury assessment, further driving market growth. As more healthcare providers adopt biomarker-based diagnostic tests, the market continues to expand.\n\n\n\nKey Market Challenges\n\nComplexity of Neurological Disorders\n\n\n\nA significant challenge in the development and adoption of neurological biomarkers is the complexity of neurological disorders. These conditions span a wide range of diseases, each with its unique characteristics and mechanisms. Disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis exhibit considerable heterogeneity among patients, making it difficult to identify universal biomarkers applicable to all cases. This complexity necessitates the discovery and validation of diverse biomarkers, a process that can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, the concept of precision medicine, which tailors treatment to individual patients based on their unique biomarker profiles, complicates the development of standardized biomarkers. Customized biomarker panels may be required for each patient, increasing the need for personalized medicine approaches.\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nRise of Personalized Medicine\n\n\n\nA key trend in the Global Neurological Biomarkers Market is the shift toward personalized medicine, which involves tailoring medical treatments to individual patients based on their genetic, biomarker, and clinical profiles. This trend is fueled by advances in genomics and biomarker technologies, which allow for more precise disease predictions and treatment planning. The sequencing of the human genome, along with high-throughput genomics technologies, has enabled the identification of genetic variations associated with neurological disorders. These genetic biomarkers are used to assess disease risk and develop personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, biomarker panels that incorporate genetic, proteomic, and imaging data are being developed to provide more accurate diagnoses and differentiate between various subtypes of neurological disorders.\n\n\n\nPersonalized medicine enhances treatment effectiveness by selecting therapies that are most likely to work for individual patients, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse effects and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.\n\n\n\nKey Neurological Biomarkers Market Players Profiled\n\nPerkinElmer Inc.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Inc.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nBanyan Biomarkers Inc.\n\nBio-Rad Laboratories Inc.\n\nF.

            "content": "recently experienced a 4% increase in its share price in the past quarter, amid significant corporate developments. The departure announcement of board member Charles J. Dockendorff may have prompted some investor reassessment, coinciding with a period where no shares were repurchased, indicating a pause in capital return strategies. The earnings results released this quarter showed an increase in sales and net income, providing a potential boost to investor confidence. While broader market volatility persisted, partly driven by the Trump administration's tariff announcements and subsequent declines across indexes like the Dow and Nasdaq, Boston Scientific's solid earnings growth over the same period possibly outweighed these market pressures. This upturn occurred despite a general market downturn of 5%, highlighting the company's robust performance amidst broader economic challenges. This performance marks a divergence from broader indices, which were weighed down by geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nNYSE:BSX Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nIn the last five years, Boston Scientific exhibited a strong total shareholder return of 241.67%, a testament to its resilience and growth in the competitive medical devices sector. This performance surpassed the broader industry and market trends over the shorter span, showcasing its substantial momentum. A confluence of factors seems to have contributed to this impressive return, including consistent earnings growth recently outpacing a declining five-year average, and significant FDA approvals enhancing its product lineup, such as the FARAWAVE NAV Ablation Catheter and positive clinical trial outcomes for the WATCHMAN FLX\u2122 device.\n\nAdditionally, the expanded partnership with Scivita Medical Technology in March 2024 marked a key development, focusing on endoscopic technology. Despite a high Price-To-Earnings ratio compared to industry averages, ongoing clinical studies and product developments continue to bolster financial confidence. The cautious pause in share repurchase activities by early 2025 indicates a potential shift in capital allocation strategy, prioritizing future growth and innovation. These elements together encapsulate a period of robust advancement and strategic positioning for Boston Scientific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

This run-up might have investors contemplating their next move.\n\nIs there a buying opportunity in Abbott Laboratories, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Check out our in-depth research report to see what our analysts have to say, it\u2019s free.\n\nWe\u2019re happy investors have made money, but we're swiping left on Abbott Laboratories for now. Here are three reasons why there are better opportunities than ABT and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Is Abbott Laboratories Not Exciting?\n\nFounded in 1888 as a small pharmaceutical company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) develops and sells a wide range of nutrition products, medical devices, and branded pharmaceuticals.\n\n1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints\n\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, Abbott Laboratories\u2019s 5.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was mediocre. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Quarterly Revenue\n\n2. Slow Organic Growth Suggests Waning Demand In Core Business\n\nWe can better understand Medical Devices & Supplies - Diversified companies by analyzing their organic revenue. This metric gives visibility into Abbott Laboratories\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, Abbott Laboratories\u2019s organic revenue averaged 1.1% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy, which can add an extra layer of complexity to its operations.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Organic Revenue Growth\n\n3. Shrinking Adjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. It also removes various one-time costs to paint a better picture of normalized profits.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Abbott Laboratories\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points over the last two years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Its adjusted operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 22.2%.",

For more detailed analysis, visit the original source.\n\nDespite this positive short-term performance, Abbott's long-term outlook raises questions. With an annualized revenue growth rate of just 5.6% over the past five years, it falls short of expectations for a leading company in the healthcare sector. As highlighted by IndexBox, the company's organic revenue has grown by a mere 1.1% per year over the last two years, suggesting potential challenges in product development or market strategy.\n\nMoreover, Abbott's adjusted operating margin, a key profitability measure, decreased by 3.6 percentage points over the past two years, settling at 22.2% for the trailing 12 months. This decline indicates potential inefficiencies in managing the cost base, despite revenue growth theoretically providing leverage for improved margins.\n\nCurrently trading at 26.6 times its forward earnings, Abbott is priced with much optimism reflected in its $136.50 per share value. Investors might want to consider alternative options, particularly those with stronger growth trajectories or sector performance.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

However, what is the reason for the critical role of these devices in contemporary vascular care? Venous stents are small, metal tubes that resemble mesh and are inserted into veins to prevent vein collapse or blockage and restore correct blood flow.\n\nThey are specifically engineered to address venous insufficiencies, a condition in which the veins cannot effectively return blood from the lower extremities back to the heart, resulting in symptoms such as varicose veins, edema, and pain.\n\nIn contrast to arterial stents, which are employed in arteries that regulate high-pressure blood flow, venous stents are designed to be more effective in veins with reduced blood pressure and distinct structural characteristics. Due to their design, they are highly effective in maintaining vein patency and alleviating symptoms associated with venous obstruction, which guarantees conformity and flexibility to the vessel wall.\n\nThe growing prevalence of chronic venous disorders, which affect millions of individuals worldwide and can result in severe complications if left untreated, is the primary factor driving the demand for venous stents. Stenting is the preferable therapeutic option due to the fact that traditional treatment options, such as anticoagulant medication and compression therapy, frequently fail to manage advanced cases of venous obstruction effectively.\n\nVenous stents provide a permanent solution by physically opening narrowed or obstructed veins, thereby enhancing blood flow and reducing the likelihood of complications such as recurrent thrombosis and leg ulcers. In the treatment of conditions such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and iliac vein compression syndrome (May-Thurner syndrome), the adoption of venous stents is particularly prevalent.\n\nStenting has been demonstrated to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life substantially. Healthcare providers are progressively selecting venous stents as the initial treatment for complex venous pathologies as awareness of venous diseases and the advantages of stenting continue to expand.\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Venous Stents Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/inquire-for-discount/?reportid=62040\n\nWhat are the market trends that are influencing the adoption of venous stents in vascular treatment?\n\nIn vascular treatment, the adoption of venous stents is influenced by various emerging market trends, which are indicative of the changing requirements of patients and healthcare providers. The growing emphasis on minimally invasive procedures is one of the most notable trends.\n\nThere has been a significant shift toward endovascular treatments for venous diseases as patients and clinicians prioritize shorter hospital stays, lower complication rates, and quicker recovery times. Venous stenting is a preferred choice for the management of chronic venous insufficiency and venous obstructions due to its minimally invasive nature, which provides a less traumatic alternative to traditional open surgery.\n\nThis trend is particularly apparent in developed regions, where the extensive adoption of minimally invasive techniques is facilitated by high patient awareness levels and advanced healthcare infrastructure. The transition to outpatient procedures has also driven the demand for venous stents, as these devices can frequently be implanted in a same-day setting, thereby mitigating the disruption to patients\u2019 daily lives.\n\nReport Scope\n\nFeature of the Report Details Market Size in 2025 USD 1,440.6 Million Projected Market Size in 2034 USD 2,987.7 Million Market Size in 2024 USD 1,346.2 Million CAGR Growth Rate 11.40% CAGR Base Year 2024 Forecast Period 2025-2034 Key Segment By Technology, Disease, Application and Region Report Coverage Revenue Estimation and Forecast, Company Profile, Competitive Landscape, Growth Factors and Recent Trends Regional Scope North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South & Central America Buying Options Request tailored purchasing options to fulfil your research requirements.\n\n(A free sample of the Venous Stents report is available upon request; please contact us for more information.)\n\nOur Free Sample Report Consists of the following:\n\nIntroduction, Overview, and in-depth industry analysis are all included in the 2024 updated report.\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak Impact Analysis is included in the package.\n\nAbout 220+ Pages Research Report (Including Recent Research)\n\nProvide detailed chapter-by-chapter guidance on the Request.\n\nUpdated Regional Analysis with a Graphical Representation of Size, Share, and Trends for the Year 2025\n\nIncludes Tables and figures have been updated.\n\nThe most recent version of the report includes the Top Market Players, their Business Strategies, Sales Volume, and Revenue Analysis\n\nCustom Market Insights (CMI) research methodology\n\n(Please note that the sample of the Venous Stents report has been modified to include the COVID-19 impact study prior to delivery.)\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Venous Stents Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/venous-stents-market/\n\nVenous Stents Market Significant Developments\n\nAfter a recall in May 2021, Becton Dickinson (BD) reintroduced its Venovo venous stent to the U.S. market in May 2022.

The market is anticipated to expand in Europe due to the growing incidence of venous diseases.\n\nIn Europe, the safety and efficacy of venous stenting have been enhanced by using self-expanding stents, bioresorbable stents, coatings, and drug-eluting stents. Oxford University, Imperial College, and the University of Sheffield researchers collaborated with the technology company ThinkSono to develop a machine learning AI algorithm (AutoDVT) that could differentiate between DVT patients and those who were not diagnosed with DVT.\n\nOver the forecast period, these developments are anticipated to augment market expansion. Furthermore, the venous stents market has experienced further growth due to the substantial increase in the number of minimally invasive venous procedures performed for complex venous diseases in recent years.\n\nIn 2024, the North American Venous Stents Market held a global market share of approximately 34.65%, with a valuation of USD 429.2 million. The regional market growth is primarily driven by the high prevalence of venous disease, particularly among the geriatric population, which has encouraged the adoption of the product in North America.\n\nNumerous investigations have demonstrated that venous stenting yields favorable outcomes in treating chronic venous insufficiency, varicose veins, and deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of venous diseases in North America is anticipated to drive the continued growth of the venous stent market share.\n\nAdditionally, advancements in stent technology have significantly influenced the pervasive adoption of venous stents in North America. Bioresorbable stents, self-expandable stents, drug-eluting stents, and coatings have all enhanced the safety and efficacy of venous stenting in North America. These developments are also contributing to the global market\u2019s overall expansion.\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of the Venous Stents Market Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/venous-stents-market/\n\n(We customized your report to meet your specific research requirements.

It has made it challenging to provide care while limiting virus spread, and it has increased the demand for hospital resources. Global healthcare systems have found adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic's problems difficult. So, since the epidemic started, surgeons have observed a drop in the number of elective surgeries performed. This postponement of non-urgent elective surgeries has an impact on planned oncology procedures. Tumor patients are particularly vulnerable to infection.Moreover, patients with cancer have higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology's study, there was a significant drop in biopsies, tumour screens, office visits, therapy, and surgeries from March to July 2020 compared to 2019. Cancer screenings for colon, breast, lung, and prostate were 75%, 85%, 56%, and 74% lower in April 2020, when the pandemic was at its worst. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of almost 800 appointments for the screening of lung cancer in just March 2020. The ratio of new patients screening remained low even after the screening returned to its regular frequency.List of Prominent Players in the Cancer Diagnostics Market:\u2022 Abbott Laboratories,\u2022 Agilent Technologies Inc.,\u2022 AMOY Diagnostics Co Ltd.,\u2022 Astellas Pharma Inc.

For instance, Hologic, Inc. declared that the Genius Digital Diagnostics System would be commercially available in Europe starting in 2021. The next-generation cervical cancer screening system uses new volumetric imaging technology and deep learning-based AI to help find women with precancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells. This should accelerate market growth.Challenges:Many hospitals in undeveloped and impoverished countries are unable to purchase diagnostic imaging equipment due to high costs and financial restrictions. Yet, due to the rising demand in these nations for diagnostic imaging procedures, hospitals that cannot afford to purchase brand-new, cutting-edge imaging systems favour rebuilt ones. As a result, this factor inhibits market expansion.Regional Trends:Due to strategic moves made by major players, a significant increase in cervical screening programmes run to improve awareness and screening, a rise in R&D, and technical advancements, Asia Pacific is predicted to have the quickest growth throughout the projection period. For instance, National Cervical Cancer Awareness Week 2019 was introduced by the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF) in November 2019. The ACCF wants to raise awareness among women all throughout Australia in order to eradicate cervical cancer by the year 2035. One of the companies supporting the ACCF screening programmes is Hologic Inc.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In November 2021, Magnetom Free was introduced by Siemens Healthineers.

            "content": "Dear Atty. Vlad,\n\nI am employed as a Medical Representative in a Pharma Company in Makati. In my employment contract, one of the conditions is that during my employment as a Medical Representative, I can be transferred to any part of the Philippines. I am assigned in the Province of Bulacan. My wife runs a business in Malolos, Bulacan and our three-year-old daughter is under my and my wife\u2019s direct care. A week ago, our National Sales Manager (NSM) issued to me a memorandum, advising me of my transfer to Bataan Province. I told my NSM that I cannot follow the directive since it will greatly affect my family, especially so that my work will be far from my daugther. Despite this, my NSM still proceeded with my transfer. Can my NSM lawfully do this? I hope you can help me.\n\nAnthony\n\n***\n\nDear Anthony,\n\nFrom what you shared to me, you were employed as a Medical Representative and one of the stipulations in your Employment Contract, which you have agreed to, is that you may be assigned to any part of the Philippines.\n\nIn the case of Pharmacia and Up John Inc. (now Pfizer Philippines Inc.), et al. vs. Ricardo P. Albayda Jr., G.R. No. 172724, 23 August 2010, the Supreme Court stated:\n\nIn addition, this Court cannot agree with the findings of the CA that the transfer of respondent was unreasonable, considering he had not been remiss in his responsibilities. What the CA failed to recognize is that the very nature of a sales man is that it is mobile and ambulant. On this point, it bears to stress that respondent signed two documents signifying his assent to be assigned anywhere in the Philippines. In respondent\u2019s Employment Application, he checked the box which asks, \u201cAre you willing to be relocated anywhere in the Philippines?\u201d In addition, in respondent\u2019s Contract of Employment, item (8) reads:\n\nYou agree, during the period of your employment, to be assigned to any work or workplace for such period as may be determined by the company and whenever the operations thereof require such assignment.\n\nEven if respondent has been performing his duties well it does not mean that petitioners\u2019 hands are tied up that they can no longer reassign respondent to another territory. And it is precisely because of respondent\u2019s good performance that petitioners want him to be reassigned to Cagayan de Oro City so that he could improve their business there.\n\nIn Abbott Laboratories (Phils.) Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, which involved a complaint filed by a medical representative against his employer drug company for illegal dismissal for allegedly terminating his employment when he refused to accept his reassignment to a new area, the Court upheld the right of the drug company to transfer or reassign its employee in accordance with its operational demands and requirements. The ruling of the Court therein, quoted hereunder, also finds application in the instant case:\n\nTherefore, Bobadilla had no valid reason to disobey the order of transfer. He had tacitly given his consent thereto when he acceded to the petitioners\u2019 policy of hiring sales staff who are willing to be assigned anywhere in the Philippines which is demanded by petitioners\u2019 business.\n\nBy the very nature of his employment, a drug salesman or medical representative is expected to travel. He should anticipate reassignment according to the demands of their business. It would be a poor drug corporation which cannot even assign its representatives or detail men to new markets calling for opening or expansion or to areas where the need for pushing its products is great. More so if such reassignments are part of the employment contract.\n\nConsidering that you were employed as a Medical Representative, who agreed to be transferred to any part of the Philippines, you may not lawfully disobey your NSM. By the very nature of your employment as a Medical Representative or a salesman, you are expected to travel and should anticipate reassignments according to the demands of the business of your employer.\n\nI hope that I was able to help you based on the facts that you have shared to me.\n\nAtty. Vlad del Rosario",

While these regulatory developments did not impact its ability to produce or distribute products, they may have influenced investor sentiment. The announcement came after a quarter where DexCom reported a 7% increase in sales, though net income declined significantly alongside a reduction in earnings per share. During the past quarter, major indices, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, experienced consecutive weekly declines of over 3%, reflecting general market volatility. In contrast, DexCom shares fell by 0.73%, a more moderate decline than broader market trends. As the company moves forward, its reaffirmation of a positive growth outlook for 2025 could provide stability despite the current market fluctuations and regulatory challenges.\n\nNasdaqGS:DXCM Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nDexCom's shares have experienced a total return of 27.60% over five years, highlighting a steady performance compared to the broader market. In recent times, DexCom has engaged in various initiatives that may have influenced its stock performance. The launch of the Stelo biosensor and integration efforts with the Omnipod 5 system positioned the company favorably within the medical equipment sector. Additionally, the approval to use its CGM technology in France expanded its international footprint.\n\nThe past year, however, saw challenges, including a securities class-action lawsuit alleging misleading sales strategy statements and significant insider selling. Despite these, DexCom's share repurchase program significantly reduced outstanding shares, arguably supporting its share price. Though the company's earnings growth of 18.1% annually over five years is impressive, it still trails behind the medical equipment industry's one-year growth. These factors offer insights into the company's longer-term stock performance amidst varying market pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Political campaigns against scientific and intellectual communities have been repeated throughout history, often with dire long-term consequences.\n\nFrom Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution in China to recent policy choices in democratic nations like Australia and the United States, a common pattern emerges: science is undermined by ideology or short-sighted economic motives, with devastating effects on technological progress and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution stalled China\u2019s advancement for a generation, the Abbott government\u2019s drastic cuts to Australia\u2019s scientific institutions led to talent loss and missed innovations, and Trump\u2019s latest assault on American science is already threatening to erode the country\u2019s technological leadership. The damage inflicted on research and innovation reverberates through economies and societies, often for decades.\n\nDuring China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, the government launched an ideological crusade that devastated the country\u2019s intellectual and scientific establishment. Academics and scientists were deemed politically unreliable and targeted for persecution.\n\nUniversities were shut down, scholars and experts were publicly humiliated, and seasoned professionals were replaced with ideologically driven loyalists who lacked expertise. Research and higher education ground to a halt, and established scientific knowledge was rejected if it conflicted with Maoist doctrine. The immediate turmoil uprooted China\u2019s knowledge base and instilled a lasting climate of fear and anti-intellectualism.\n\nThe long-term consequences were severe. An entire generation of young people was denied a formal education, leaving a deep gap in expertise. With universities closed and research halted, China fell behind in technology and productivity, experiencing years of economic stagnation and bureaucratic paralysis as knowledgeable officials were purged.\n\nIt took decades for the country to recover. Only after reforms in the 1980s did China begin to rebuild its scientific community. Analysts note that it took over 30 years to overcome the intellectual stagnation caused by the Cultural Revolution and re-emerge as a global leader in science and technology.\n\nThose lost decades represent a significant setback in China\u2019s technological progress and economic development. The Cultural Revolution stands as a stark warning of how politicized attacks on knowledge can cripple a country\u2019s innovation engine.\n\nAustralia witnessed a different kind of attack on science \u2013 one driven by fiscal policy under Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s government. In 2014, the Abbott administration sharply slashed funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia\u2019s premier national research agency, along with cuts to other scientific programs.\n\nOver four years, the government cut approximately $111 million from CSIRO\u2019s budget, forcing the organisation into an unprecedented round of layoffs that eliminated nearly 20 per cent of its workforce within two years. Around 700 jobs were lost in 2014-15 alone, with more to follow. Scientists across the country were left holding their breath to see where the axe would fall, as uncertainty gripped institutes and laboratories.\n\nNo area of research was truly spared. CSIRO shut down eight research sites, and critical programs were canceled, including initiatives in neuroscience, colorectal cancer, water safety, climate science, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nThe cuts were so severe that hundreds of scientists staged an unprecedented protest against the government\u2019s decisions. The CSIRO Staff Association bluntly condemned the cuts as driven by ignorance and warned they would cause significant damage to Australia\u2019s economy in the long run.\n\nThe economic and innovative fallout from these cuts became a growing concern. Research leaders noted that such funding withdrawals would negatively impact Australia\u2019s innovation performance and international standing.\n\nThe country, traditionally strong in fields like environmental science and mining technology, risked losing its competitive edge as laboratories went quiet and top talent drifted away. Surveys found morale plummeting at CSIRO, with many scientists considering leaving for opportunities abroad, exacerbating a potential brain drain.\n\nEntire areas of inquiry \u2013 such as climate adaptation and certain medical research projects \u2013 saw years of work jeopardised or halted. The loss of expertise meant fewer mentors for the next generation of scientists and fewer innovations coming to market. Industries reliant on public research support faced a slowdown in innovation.\n\nFor example, policy uncertainty under Abbott also hit the clean energy sector: investment in Australian renewable energy projects dropped by 31 per cent during his tenure, as investors pulled back amid a lack of government support and clear targets.\n\nSuch missed opportunities in emerging industries translated to real economic costs \u2013 lost jobs, lost patents, and lost time in the global race for new technologies.\n\nAustralia\u2019s experience under Abbott vividly illustrates how quickly scientific capacity can be eroded, and how that erosion can undermine a nation\u2019s future economic prospects. What takes decades to build in scientific infrastructure and expertise can be dismantled in a fraction of that time, with recovery proving slow and difficult.\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House in 2025 has ushered in a new era of hostility toward science in the United States, with aggressive budget cuts and a coordinated suppression of federal research. In just the first month of his second term, the administration has launched a sweeping assault on research funding, environmental policy, and scientific institutions.\n\nThe White House has directed agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health to prepare for drastic reductions, with reports indicating that the NSF may see its funding slashed by more than half. The NIH terminated approximately 1,200 probationary employees, accounting for about 10% of its workforce.\n\nMore than 170 NSF employees have already been dismissed, with the HR director indicating that work force reductions of 50% were expected. Nearly 400 staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency have lost their jobs as part of an aggressive push to downsize with Administration assertions varying between 65% of staff or 65% of budget cut.\n\nScientific grants have been frozen, leaving researchers unable to access funding that had already been approved. The Department of Energy has halted disbursements for clean energy research programs, while legal maneuvers are reportedly being explored to block the spending of funds Congress had allocated for science.\n\nTrump has also issued a flurry of executive orders dismantling environmental regulations and clean energy programs. The United States has once again withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement, and agencies have been directed to fast-track oil and gas leasing on public lands while suspending renewable energy permits.\n\nThe EPA is reviewing the possibility of reversing key emissions regulations, including carbon limits on power plants and fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. Clean energy incentives created under the previous administration have been frozen, causing uncertainty in the solar, wind, and electric vehicle industries.\n\nA planned $5 billion program for EV charging infrastructure has been put on indefinite hold, and new tariffs are being considered for imported clean technology components, disrupting supply chains and causing a slowdown in investment announcements.\n\nBeyond budget cuts and deregulation, the administration is taking direct steps to suppress scientific discourse within federal agencies. Scientists have been instructed to remove references to climate change, diversity, and environmental justice from grant applications and public materials.\n\nResearchers are delaying or altering the language of their studies to avoid political backlash. Advisory committees that provide independent scientific guidance to agencies like NASA and NOAA have been suspended or dissolved.\n\nThe administration has also targeted data transparency, with reports that certain climate and social science databases may be removed from federal websites. The chilling effect is palpable, with scientists fearful of speaking publicly or publishing research that contradicts the administration\u2019s political narrative.\n\nIn Australia, the Liberal Party has been positioning itself as a pro-innovation force ahead of the 2025 election, making broad promises to support emerging scientific and engineering fields.\n\nTheir platform vows to back Australian businesses in advanced manufacturing, medical research, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and space technology, turning innovation into high-paying jobs and global opportunities. Such rhetoric suggests a recognition that research and development are critical for national competitiveness.\n\nHowever, the Coalition has a track record of resisting stronger climate policies since Abbott\u2019s cuts to CSIRO and other research, prioritizing fossil fuel development, and cutting funding for climate research.\n\nWhile the Coalition committed Australia to the Paris Agreement under Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, successive leaders have downplayed the urgency of climate action. Under Scott Morrison, the government pledged net zero by 2050 but refused to increase 2030 emissions targets and continued expanding coal and gas projects.\n\nMorrison\u2019s government later defunded key renewable energy agencies, including ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, while approving new coal mine expansions.\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s approach to climate disasters also faced criticism, particularly Morrison\u2019s slow response to the Black Summer bushfires, during which he initially refused to acknowledge the role of climate change.\n\nUnder current leader Peter Dutton, the Coalition has signaled a shift toward nuclear energy while questioning Labor\u2019s renewable energy targets and hinting at revising Australia\u2019s climate commitments. Dutton has argued for a continued role for fossil fuels, and the Coalition has promised to repeal environmental regulations that could slow new mining and energy projects.\n\nMuch like the US rhetoric around DEI, both Morrison and Dutton have accused universities of fostering \u201cleft-wing activism\u201d in environmental studies, particularly in programs advocating for fossil fuel divestment and climate protest movements.\n\nWith an election approaching, the Coalition appears set to continue its long-standing reluctance to embrace stronger climate policies, leaving Australia at risk of falling behind in the global transition to clean energy.\n\nTheir broader policy directions still emphasise fiscal restraint and eliminating wasteful spending, raising concerns that certain scientific programs\u2014particularly in climate research \u2013 could again be on the chopping block. The question remains whether the Liberals have truly learned from the damage inflicted under Abbott, or if their science-friendly language is merely a strategic rebrand.\n\nThe lessons from history are clear. Undermining scientific institutions and expertise yields profound long-term costs. China\u2019s Cultural Revolution left the country technologically crippled until reforms reversed course over two decades later.\n\nAustralia\u2019s short-term budget savings under Abbott came at the price of lost talent and slowed innovation. Now, the United States faces similar risks, as the systematic rollback of science funding and climate policy threatens to weaken its global leadership in research. The parallels are undeniable, and the consequences are predictable.\n\nThe test for Australian policymakers will be whether they recognise these lessons and choose to prioritise knowledge, research, and innovation before the damage becomes irreversible.\n\nThe test for Australian voters is whether they pay attention to what is happening in the United States and recognise the damage similar actions by Abbott caused as they go to the polls.",

            "content": "Two former Abbott Laboratories employees have sued the company, claiming managers retaliated against them after they outed the Scarborough plant for rushing COVID-19 tests, including defective ones, to the public.\n\nThe women allege the company retaliated by creating a hostile environment, failing to accommodate their disabilities and not allowing them to work from home. At the time, the company was requiring its employees to work in the office four days a week.\n\nIn two separate federal lawsuits filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, Jennifer Campinell, of Durham, and Jessica Mayhew, of Minot, accused the medical device manufacturing company of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Maine Human Rights Act and the Maine Whistleblower Protection Act. They are both represented by Laura White and Danielle Quinlan, attorneys out of Kennebunk.\n\nCampinell has anxiety and depression, while Mayhew has anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (which includes a strong startle response) and a fainting disorder, according to the lawsuits.\n\nBoth women said the company\u2019s refusal to accommodate their disabilities and resulting retaliation and a hostile work environment exacerbated their symptoms. They could not be reached through their attorney to discuss their complaints.\n\nAbbott has denied the women\u2019s claims. In a short emailed statement, the company said it \u201cpromotes and values a welcoming work environment and is committed to fair treatment of all its employees\u201d and called the lawsuits \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEFECTIVE TESTS\n\nCampinell and Mayhew were hired as a quality assurance engineer and specialist, respectively, in 2020, right as the Chicago-based company was ramping up production of COVID-19 test kits, including BinaxNOW and ID NOW rapid tests. By late 2021, Abbott was producing more than 50 million tests per month.\n\nThe company made $7.7 billion from the sale of global testing supplies in 2021, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report for that year.\n\nAccording to Campinell\u2019s lawsuit, part of her role as a quality assurance lead was to decrease the number of defective tests that reach shelves. She was tasked with creating new processes to prevent poor-quality products from leaving the facility. Mayhew was also on the team.\n\nCampinell said she discovered over four months that up to 33% of the lots produced at the Scarborough facility were defective but were being released to the market without any corrective action. Industry standard and FDA expectations are less than 10% of products, according to the lawsuit.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, many companies making tests, swabs, masks and other needed equipment were allowed to ramp up production to quicker-than-normal rates to address the urgent need for the supplies.\n\nAbbott\u2019s rapid tests were fast-tracked through the FDA for emergency use, and in 2020, the company entered into a $750 million contract with the White House to provide 150 million tests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the suit, Campinell alleged that when she presented her findings to leadership, she was met with \u201copposition, hostility and public insults.\u201d\n\nShe later presented the results to corporate leadership and indicated that the failure was due in part to lack of training, lack of personnel qualification, and pressure from corporate to ship product and put it on the market, despite the product being defective.\n\n\u201cPersonnel and departments who shipped product and moved reports through extremely quickly were frequently rewarded with praise and bonuses,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cNo bonuses or public praise were provided to personnel who slowed down production in order to ensure product is in conformity with standards, effective and safe.\u201d\n\n\u2018BULLYING\u2019 AND RETALIATION\n\nCampinell claims that management and co-workers retaliated against her for alerting corporate leaders to these issues and for implementing a new training process that \u201ctook too much time,\u201d according to the lawsuit. She said she was met with \u201cunprofessional, bullying behavior,\u201d called stupid and yelled at.\n\nThe negative work environment heightened her depression and anxiety, and she requested a change to her schedule to allow more days working from home. She worked remotely when she was first hired, so she knew she could perform her responsibilities at home. Plus, all meetings were conducted over videoconferencing, she said.\n\nIn the suit, Campinell said the company denied her requests to work remotely, despite having sufficient support from her primary care physician, and treated her with public disdain and harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayhew\u2019s lawsuit closely mirrors Campinell\u2019s complaints: refusal to allow four days of remote work, retaliation, and treating with disdain.\n\nBoth women claim the company offered them noise-canceling headphones and other solutions that did not address the root cause of their issues.\n\nMayhew also said she was not allowed to switch desks with a colleague that would have put her back to windows, rather than a high-traffic area. She alleged that she was rated lower than her co-workers and was passed over for a promotion because of her mental health.\n\nBoth women said they were \u201cconstructively discharged,\u201d meaning they left due to \u201cintolerable working conditions\u201d in 2022. Mayhew left after three months of short-term disability leave.",

            "content": "Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nDoes the March share price for Abbott Laboratories ( NYSE:ABT ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nAnalyst price target for ABT is US$136 which is 10.0% below our fair value estimate\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$14b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.8%) = US$352b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$352b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$180b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$261b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$137, the company appears about fair value at a 8.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nNYSE:ABT Discounted Cash Flow March 8th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Abbott Laboratories as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.962. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This follows a 7% rate increase for sewer services that went into effect in January.\n\nNo increases are expected this year in city electric rates.\n\nBrian O\u2019Connell, director of utilities and infrastructure for the city, presented the water rate adjustment proposal recently to the Board of Public Utilities. The department\u2019s budget with the water and sewer rate increases for 2025 had already been approved.\n\nO\u2019Connell said the last time the city upped its electric rates was in July of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt looks like our current rates will cover the expenses we have projected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city is predicting higher electric sales next year, which could help prolong the need for rate hikes.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating some higher sales due to load growth. We\u2019ll continue to see that in the future as Abbott comes on line,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in November of the new Abbott Labs facility planned on the north side of the city.\n\nKilowatt hour sales have grown from 483,811 in 2020 to an expected 518,700 in 2025.\n\nBut while electric rates will remain steady, O\u2019Connell recommended that both the water and sewer rates be increased by 7%.\n\nWater sales have been relatively flat in recent years, partially due to appliances and equipment that are built to use water more efficiently, he said.\n\nHistorically, the typical rate increases for water and sewer services tend to be in the area of 5% or 6%. O\u2019Connell said the decision to ask for 7% increases was not made without great deliberation.\n\n\u201cThe expenses are there to justify it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last time the water and sewer rates were increased was in 2023.\n\nOne of the larger expenses forecasted in the water budget is the replacement of aging water meters. The budget calls for $2 million to be put toward new meters. O\u2019Connell said he had wanted to replace more, but the budget couldn\u2019t tolerate it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large number of water meters failing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe rates are not keeping up with expenses,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nWhile residential users are expected to average $1 more a month for water, the average commercial user will see monthly bills increase from $87 to $94, and industrial users from $755 to $809.\n\nO\u2019Connell reported that while water sales were up 2.8% in 2024, the higher expenses are outpacing the additional sales revenue. The cash balances were cut into last year, with more dips into the balance expected this year.\n\n\u201cIf we do not make some adjustment in 2025, it will likely result in the need for a larger adjustment in 2026,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.",

High yields can seem attractive to income seekers, but unless a company has a steady, reliable business, payout cuts are a real possibility no matter how juicy its dividend yield. For those seeking dividend stocks to buy and hold for good, it's best to opt for companies that have proven they can perform relatively well -- and continue raising their dividends -- through economic and market fluctuations.\n\nMedtronic (MDT -1.90%) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT -1.79%) are two such examples in the healthcare industry. Both are leading medical device giants that should continue paying dividends for a long time. Let me explain.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic's business spans several therapeutic areas where it develops and markets medical devices for areas including diabetes care, neuroscience, cardiovascular health, and medical-surgical. The company boasts dozens of products and routinely earns clearance for new ones or more indications for existing ones. Medtronic bagged about 120 approvals in the past 12 months alone.\n\nThe company's entrenched position in healthcare (where people's lives are at stake) and innovative abilities explain its consistent financial results.\n\nMDT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nThese factors also show Medtronic's ability to remain successful for a long time. Even companies that offer valuable medical products and services -- which are always in high demand -- can go under if they fail to keep up with changing needs and dynamics in the sector. Based on the company's history, that's unlikely to happen. A few years ago, it launched the MiniMed 780G, an innovative insulin pump that can automatically adjust insulin delivery based on patients' glucose levels.\n\nIt is currently working on a robotic-assisted surgery device, the Hugo System, for an area that remains deeply underpenetrated. Both of these niches could represent powerful, long-term tailwinds for the company. Furthermore, Medtronic is implementing artificial intelligence (AI) across its business, something that could improve efficiency and boost the bottom line and margins in the long run. Lastly, Medtronic has an impressive dividend history. The company has raised its payouts in the past 47 consecutive years. Just three more years and Medtronic will be a Dividend King.\n\nIts forward yield of 3% is impressive enough. The S&P 500's average is 1.3%. Medtronic's dividend track record, solid business, and growth opportunities make it a company that can remain successful and continue rewarding shareholders for a long time.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nWhereas Medtronic is still chasing Dividend King status, Abbott Laboratories is already there. The company has increased its payouts for 52 years straight, and everything points to the healthcare leader maintaining that streak for many more years. Consider Abbott's diversified operations. Though its medical device business is arguably its most important, the company has relied on others, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutrition, at various times when sales of its devices fell (such as in the early days of the pandemic).\n\nEven within its medical device segment, Abbott is diversified, with such units as structural heart, heart failure, rhythm management, electrophysiology, etc. Its most important segment, though, remains diabetes care where it markets the FreeStyle Libre, one of the leading franchises of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems on the market. Abbott's management pointed out that the FreeStyle Libre is the most successful medical device of all time in terms of sales, and it is still growing at a good clip.\n\nExpect that to continue since, as the company said last year, only about 1% of adults worldwide have access to CGM technology. Abbott has expanded its reach in this field. Typically, patients (at least in the U.S.) need a prescription for CGM devices, and they are reserved for those with diabetes. Last year, Abbott Labs launched the Lingo, an over-the-counter CGM option for the general population. There will be plenty more room for growth in this and other areas for Abbott.\n\nThe company has also been a consistent performer.\n\nABT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nReturning to Abbott's dividend, the company's forward yield is 1.7%. That's not too impressive, but Abbott Laboratories makes up for it with its strong underlying business and excellent prospects. This, too, is a dividend stock to hold onto for good.",

            "content": "Dublin, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Japan in-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Japan in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market will be worth US$ 7.02 Billion by 2033, up from US$ 4.84 Billion in 2024. The market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.20% between 2025 and 2033.\n\nThe growth in the market is fueled by factors including improvements in diagnostic technology, an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, and rising healthcare expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Japan, IVD is of significant importance for the early diagnosis of diseases, particularly cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases. Rising chronic diseases and an aging population boosted the demand for high-technology diagnostics. Japan's healthcare system depends significantly on IVD for precision medicine to enable customized treatment and enhanced patient outcomes.\n\nIn addition, regulatory developments and AI-based diagnostic innovations further fuel the efficiency and accessibility of IVD testing. The extensive use of IVD in research laboratories, clinics, and hospitals confirms its role in Japan's changing healthcare ecosystem, providing timely and precise medical decision-making.\n\n\n\nDrivers of Growth in the Japan IVD Market\n\nIncreasing Chronic Disease Prevalence\n\n\n\nJapan's growing elderly population has resulted in more chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This has increased the need for sophisticated IVD technology for early detection and monitoring of diseases. Molecular tests and immunoassays are diagnostic devices that assist in the accurate diagnosis of age-related diseases. T\n\nhe government is also actively encouraging early screening programs in order to curb healthcare expenses. As the incidence of chronic diseases is on the increase, the IVD market in Japan is growing to cater to the increasing demand for efficient, precise, and fast testing technologies within hospitals and diagnostic facilities. Infectious diseases such as HBV, TB, HCV, and HIV, as well as chronic diseases and cancer, are challenges that Japan is facing. The population is aging fast, with approximately 36.23 million individuals aged 65 and above as of September 2023.\n\n\n\nAdvancements in Diagnostic Technologies\n\n\n\nJapan is a world leader in medical technology innovation, leading IVD advancements. The combination of AI, automation, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enhanced the accuracy of diagnostic processes. Digital pathology equipment and automated laboratory systems allow for quicker, more precise diagnoses, minimizing the risk of human error. Point-of-care testing advancements are becoming more portable, especially for rural and remote regions. With ongoing R&D spending, the Japanese IVD market is growing technologically at a fast pace, providing enhanced testing for a range of diseases.\n\n\n\nGovernment Initiatives and Healthcare Investments\n\n\n\nThe government of Japan actively encourages the development and implementation of IVD technologies through healthcare policy and funding schemes. Public health programs for early disease detection and precision medicine have boosted demand for diagnostic solutions. Japan's universal healthcare program also guarantees affordability and accessibility of IVD testing, promoting market growth. Private players are worked with by the government to enhance diagnostic research, especially in the field of personalized medicine.\n\nStrong regulatory and financial support offers a stable platform for IVD companies to launch new products, hence promoting market growth. Japan's \"Health Care 2035\" vision has an aim of building a long-term healthcare system that provides exceptional health outcomes based on responsive and fair care. It aims at making Japan the global leader in healthcare with the emphasis on value-based care, empowerment of people, and universal health security.\n\n\n\nChallenges for the Japan IVD Market\n\nStringent Regulatory Framework\n\n\n\nThe country has strong regulatory policies related to the clearance of medical devices, including the IVD product. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) maintains stringent assessment processes, which take a longer time to approve new diagnostic technologies. Regulation compliance is difficult, particularly for international companies new to the market. These tight policies are apt to hamper innovation and make advanced diagnostic instruments unavailable. A lot of time and resources must be dedicated by companies to learn Japan's regulations, making market entry and expansion difficult.\n\n\n\nHigh Expenses of Advanced Diagnostic Tests\n\n\n\nAlthough Japan boasts a strong healthcare system, advanced IVD tests are expensive, making them inaccessible to certain patients. Sophisticated molecular diagnostics, genetic testing, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) demand high-cost equipment and reagents. Most hospitals and clinics are reluctant to invest in high-cost diagnostic equipment due to financial constraints. Moreover, reimbursement schemes do not always pay for these tests in full, which means they are not as accessible to the general population. The exorbitant price of sophisticated diagnostics is still one of the most important market growth obstacles in Japan.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $4.84 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $7.02 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.2% Regions Covered Japan\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Key Person, Recent Development, Revenue\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nDanaher Corporation\n\nBiomerieux\n\nRoche Diagnostics\n\nBecton\n\nSysmex Corporation\n\nBio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThermofisher Scientific Inc.\n\nJapan IVD Market Segments\n\nTest Type\n\nClinical Chemistry\n\nMolecular Diagnostics\n\nImmuno Diagnostics\n\nHaematology\n\nOther Types\n\nProduct\n\nInstrument\n\nReagent\n\nOthers\n\nUsability\n\nDisposable IVD Devices\n\nReusable IVD Devices\n\nApplication\n\nInfectious Disease\n\nDiabetes\n\nCancer/Oncology\n\nCardiology\n\nAutoimmune Disease\n\nNephrology\n\nOther Applications\n\nEnd Users\n\nDiagnostic Laboratories\n\nHospitals & Clinics\n\nOther End Users\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/siokrq\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

This includes peer-reviewed medical journals, reputable media outlets, government reports, court records and interviews with qualified experts.\n\nAs of March 2025, there were 663 active baby formula necrotizing enterocolitis lawsuits pending in MDL 3026 before U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer in the Northern District of Illinois. The first test cases \u2014 called bellwether trials \u2014 will begin in 2025.\n\nBaby Formula MDL Bellwether Trial Schedule May 5, 2025: Mar v. Abbott Laboratories.\n\nMar v. Abbott Laboratories. August 11, 2025: K.B. v. Abbott Laboratories.\n\nK.B. v. Abbott Laboratories. November 3, 2025: Brown v. Abbott Laboratories.\n\nBrown v. Abbott Laboratories. February 2, 2026: Inman v. Mead Johnson & Company, LLC, et al.\n\nWhile there are still no approved settlements or jury verdicts in the Illinois MDL, a state court case in Illinois ended in a $60 million plaintiff\u2019s verdict in March 2024. In July 2024, a Missouri jury awarded $495 million to NEC baby formula plaintiffs. A Missouri jury ruled in late October 2024 in favor of Abbott Laboratories and Reckitt, rejecting claims that their cow\u2019s milk-based baby formulas caused necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants. The five-week trial verdict marked the companies\u2019 first win in a baby formula lawsuit. Elizabeth Whitfield, who sought $6.2 billion, argued that her son Kaine developed NEC after using these formulas. Abbott and Reckitt defended their products as essential nutrition for vulnerable infants and stated that no scientific evidence links their formulas to NEC.\n\nBaby Formula Litigation Timeline February 2025: With the first bellwether trial just a few months away, the defendants in the baby formula MDL have filed a motion for summary judgment. This could largely end the litigation in their favor if approved, but is unclear how likely that is. Baby formula cases that have already gone to trial in state court have produced two major wins for plaintiffs.\n\nJanuary 2025: 2025 is set up to be a key year for the ongoing baby formula NEC litigation. The first bellwether trial in the MDL is set for May 5, with additional trials following in August and November.\n\nOctober 2024: The parties in the MDL have agreed on a bellwether trial date proposal, with the first case set to go to trial on May 5, 2025. Judge Pallmeyer must approve the proposal, which has the four cases running through February 2026.\n\nSeptember 2024: The trial order has been set for the four upcoming bellwether cases. Ericka Mar, Administratrix of the Estate of RaiLee Mar v. Abbott Laboratories, is set to go to trial first. Judge Pallmeyer has directed counsel to set firm trial dates for these cases.\n\nJuly 2024: A Missouri jury awarded $495 million to the family of an infant who suffered severe complications from NEC after ingesting Abbott's premature infant formula in the NICU. Lawyers are saying this verdict could still influence the course of all baby formula litigation moving forward. The award comprised $95 million in damages and $400 million in punitive damages. Abbott has said they disagree with the verdict and will try to overturn it. This was a state court case, and bellwether trials in the federal MDL cases should start in May 2025 if the defendants don't try to negotiate a settlement before then.\n\nJune 2024: Judge Pallmeyer released a scheduling order, and the start date of the first bellwether test trial became clear. According to the order, the first bellwether test trial will be in May 2025. Even if this bellwether is the first in the MDL, an Illinois jury trial ended in a $60 million verdict for a mother who lost her child to NEC.\n\nMay 2024: MDL Judge Pallmeyer ordered that plaintiffs provide specific evidence that an infant ingested a Mead Johnson product before naming the company as a defendant in the litigation. Evidence may include medical and feeding records from birth.\n\nMarch 2024: An Illinois jury ruled that Mead Johnson, a subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser, must compensate the mother of a premature infant who died from an intestinal disease after being given the company's baby formula, Enfamil, with a verdict of $60 million.\n\nFebruary 2024: Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer scheduled hearings that involved several plaintiffs on sealed/private motions for March 2024.\n\nDecember 2023: Four bellwether cases had been selected, but the trial start dates weren't confirmed. Lawyers expected the first trials to take place in 2024.\n\nNovember 2023: On Nov. 3, 2023, Justice Pallmeyer signed an order noting that Mead Johnson\u2019s motions to dismiss were entered and continued for briefing. The plaintiffs\u2019 responses must be filed on or before Jan. 6, 2024.\n\nOctober 2023: The judge signed an order outlining the definition of terms and procedures the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to for how to handle NEC pathology reports and expert analysis.\n\nJuly 2023: Judge Pallmeyer held a status conference.\n\nApril 2023: Lawyers were negotiating how discovery should proceed.\n\nMarch 2023: Science Day was scheduled for May 3, 2023. Both sides present the science of NEC and its link to cow\u2019s milk baby formula before the court.\n\nAugust 2022: The Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation consolidated about 97 lawsuits over NEC claims in Illinois MDL 3026.\n\nJudge Matthew Kennelly presides over a separate Abbott MDL, no. 3037. This MDL is also in Illinois and is related to bacterial contamination of Abbott\u2019s baby formulas. It does not have anything to do with NEC claims.\n\nWhy are Parents Filing Similac and Enfamil Lawsuits?\n\nNEC baby formula lawsuits were filed because infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis after consuming Similac or Enfamil cow\u2019s milk baby formula. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a severe gastrointestinal disease that causes intestinal tissue death and could lead to serious health problems or death. Studies have shown that premature babies fed cow\u2019s milk baby formula have an increased risk of developing NEC. An NEC lawsuit for baby formula claims that formula makers Abbott and Mead Johnson knew about the risk but failed to warn the public and continued to sell dangerous products. NIH-Funded Study on Donor Milk and NEC A study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in September 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed some significant findings about feeding highly premature babies. The research found that babies born very early \u2014 before 29 weeks or weighing less than 2.2 pounds \u2014 fed donated human milk were much less likely to develop NEC than those fed baby formula. Specifically, only 4.2% of the babies who received human milk developed NEC, while 9% of those who received formula did. This study, which involved 483 infants, provides strong evidence that giving extremely premature babies donor human milk can help lower their risk of this harmful condition. Ongoing Clinical Trials and Research Priorities In September 2024, the NEC in Preterm Infants Working Group, a U.S. Health and Human Services Department group focused on premature infants\u2019 health, released recommendations concerning NEC.\n\nWorking Group Recommendations More research should be done on how different feeding methods can influence the risk of NEC.\n\nIt's essential to better understand the nutritional needs of premature infants to ensure they receive the best care.\n\nWhen possible, there should be increased efforts to help parents produce enough milk and learn effective breastfeeding techniques.\n\nResearch is needed to understand how donor or parent milk is collected, processed, stored, and given to infants can affect their nutritional quality and digestive health.\n\nEfforts should be made to organize large-scale clinical studies to explore how different feeding practices relate to NEC risk.\n\nThe working group emphasized that NEC is a complex disease influenced by various factors, and pointed out that one baby dies every day from the condition. Their findings highlight the importance of improving milk production, enhancing the benefits found in human milk and ensuring that families have better access to donor milk when needed. In April 2022, judges consolidated Similac and Enfamil lawsuits nationwide into multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of Illinois under MDL 3026. These cases all claim that \u201ccow\u2019s milk-based infant formula products marketed under the Similac and Enfamil brand names have a higher propensity to cause necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants born prematurely than other, allegedly safer alternatives,\u201d according to the case transfer order.\n\nWho Qualifies to File an NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit?\n\nParents or caregivers of premature babies who developed NEC after consuming Similac or Enfamil cow\u2019s milk baby formulas may qualify to file an NEC baby formula lawsuit. Babies may have consumed Similac or Enfamil in the hospital, and parents may have taken formula from the hospital or bought formula after bringing their preemie home. Lawyers encourage parents and caregivers to keep all medical records, receipts and formula packaging as evidence in their case. If you don\u2019t know if your baby was fed Similac or Enfamil, your lawyer may be able to help get this information.\n\nHow Much Will Baby Formula Lawsuits Be Worth?\n\nThe exact worth of Enfamil and Similac baby formula lawsuits has yet to be determined, though lawyers speculate the value could be in the millions. In March 2024, a state court jury in Illinois awarded $60 million to a mother who lost her child after the infant developed NEC following feeding with Enfamil. It\u2019s important to note that parents and caregivers are not guaranteed a specific amount of compensation. The severity of injuries, the cost of financial or physical damages and other losses may influence the value of a baby formula case. After the first bellwether cases in 2025, lawyers will better understand the potential value of baby formula cases. Jury verdicts after bellwether trials could lead to global baby formula settlements.\n\nSimilac and Enfamil Baby Formula Recalls",

This uptick coincides with several noteworthy developments, including Abbott's collaboration with Cadrenal Therapeutics for the TECH-LVAD trial, which could enhance its footprint in the growing LVAD market valued at $1.1 billion in 2023. The alliance leverages Abbott's advanced HeartMate 3 technology. Additionally, Abbott's strong financial performance, with Q4 2024 results showing substantial growth in sales and net income, may have bolstered investor confidence. The declaration of a quarterly dividend, marking consistent dividends since 1924, further signals stability. Despite market volatility due to tariffs impacting other sectors and companies like Target and Best Buy, Abbott's share buyback program and positive earnings guidance for 2025 reinforced its position. While broader market indices saw declines amid these economic concerns, Abbott's strategic moves and solid financials seemed to counterbalance the external market pressures.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings on Abbott Laboratories.\n\nNYSE:ABT Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Abbott Laboratories achieved a total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, of 98.84%. During this period, Abbott's robust earnings growth, reflected in a remarkable increase in annual profits, has significantly outpaced the broader Medical Equipment industry. The company's results have underscored strong financial health, evidenced by higher net profit margins which improved from 14.2% to a very large percentage.\n\nKey factors include Abbott's continual commitment to returning capital to shareholders, exemplified by consistent dividend increases highlighted by 53 consecutive years of growth. Furthermore, a substantial buyback program repurchased over 43 million shares since December 2021, enhancing shareholder value. Abbott also strengthened its market position through strategic collaborations like the one with Insulet Corporation, optimizing their glucose monitoring technology. These developments have collectively contributed to the substantial long-term gains observed in Abbott's share performance.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Abbott Laboratories's (ABT, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-03-04, Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $85.98. It's currently trading at a price of $140.22. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -63.08%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $4.67 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 12.10%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 49.32 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 36.65 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 85.98\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $64.73. This valuation indicates that the Abbott Laboratories is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -116.62%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\n\nNavigating with GuruFocus:\n\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

Yet, Abbott Nutrition , an infant formula manufacturing company, is sponsoring a \u2018national paediatrics summit\u2019 in a five-star hotel in Dehradun on March 8 and 9.In 2020, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), the largest association of paediatricians in India, had admitted taking funding from Abbott India Ltd for its conferences claiming that the pharmaceutical division was a different company from Abbott Nutrition, though the multinational, Abbott Laboratories, had clarified that Abbott Nutrition was its subsidiary. The union health ministry too flagged it as a violation of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act and sought explanation from the IAP. However, beyond the show cause notice, no action had been taken against either Abbott India Ltd or IAP for violating the Act.Section 9(2) of IMS Act states that no producer, supplier, distributor or seller of infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles or infant foods shall offer or give, directly or indirectly, \u201ccontribution or pecuniary benefit to a health worker or any association of health workers, including funding of seminar, meeting, conferences, educational course, contest, fellowship, research work or sponsorship.\u201d Violation of the IMS Act being a criminal offence, the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI), which is gazetted as an organisation to monitor compliance of the Act, has filed a police complaint with the office of the Uttarakhand Director General of Police and alerted the health ministry.In response to TOI\u2019s query, Abbott India stated: \u201cNo information regarding infant milk substitute products will be presented and the National Pediatric Summit is fully compliant with the IMS Act. This summit is organized to educate about pediatric nutrition and provides valuable scientific knowledge to healthcare professionals and the scientific community, helping them meet the evolving needs of children in India.\u201d\u201cAbbott is very well aware that it is a violation because the law is absolutely clear that they cannot fund or sponsor any conference of health workers, including doctors. The content of the conference is immaterial. They have been emboldened by the government\u2019s inaction on earlier violations. It is going to get worse if the government does not crackdown on this. Paediatricians\u2019 meetings get so much funding from pharma and vaccine companies and yet they try to find excuses to take money from infant formula companies. It\u2019s a shame that they collude with the companies to break the law of the land,\u201d said Dr Arun Gupta of BPNI.IAP president Dr Vasant Khalatkar did not respond to TOI\u2019s queries.

Valued at $239.4 billion by market cap, Abbott\u2019s extensive portfolio includes life-changing technologies, with leading businesses and products in diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional and branded generic medicines.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as \"mega-cap stocks,\" Abbott Laboratories fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the healthcare sector. Abbott employs nearly 114,000 people in more than 160 countries across the globe.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nABT touched its three-year high of $138.37 in the previous trading session of Feb. 28 before slightly pulling back. ABT stock has soared more than 16% over the past three months, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI) 2% dip during the same time frame.\n\nOver the longer term, Abbott\u2019s performance looks even more impressive. ABT has soared nearly 15% over the past 52 weeks and 22.2% over the past six months, outpacing Dow\u2019s 12.6% surge over the past year and 6.7% gains over the past six months.\n\nTo confirm the bullish trend, Abbott has remained consistently above its 200-day moving average since early August 2024 and above its 50-day moving average since mid-Jan.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\u2019 stock prices increased 85 basis points after the release of its impressive Q4 results on Feb. 22. Driven by robust growth in organic sales in the U.S. as well as internationally, Abbott\u2019s overall topline increased 7.2% year-over-year to approximately $11 billion. Meanwhile, the company observed a significant improvement in profitability, with its non-GAAP earnings surging 12.2% year-over-year to $2.4 billion and its adjusted EPS increasing 12.6% year-over-year to $1.34, matching the Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nFurthermore, the company expects its full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin to range between 23.5% to 24%, representing a 150 basis point expansion at midpoint compared to 2024.

Our law firm is reviewing NEC lawsuits in all 50 states.\n\nMedical research links cow milk-based infant formulas such as Similac and Enfamil to a dangerous neonatal medical condition known as necrotizing enterocolitis. These newborn NEC formula lawsuits make a lot of allegations. But at their core, they allege that the makers of these formulas knew of the risk of NEC and did nothing to warn families and give them a choice.\n\nIf your premature baby was diagnosed with NEC after being given Similac or Enfamil formula, you may be able to participate in a class action lawsuit against the formula companies and receive financial compensation for the harm that was done to your child.\n\nOur law firm is currently seeking new preemie baby formula lawsuits to represent families who have suffered as a result of this infant formula. Our NEC formula lawyers are bringing lawsuits against baby formula manufacturers. Three cases have already gone to trial in state court as we discuss below. The first trial in the MDL will be in May 2025.\n\nOn this page, you will find:\n\nThe latest news and updates on the ongoing NEC infant formula litigation in federal and state courts, How our toxic NEC formula lawyers believe these claims will unfold, and Predicted settlement payouts if this litigation is as successful as expected.\n\nCall our baby formula lawyers today in all 50 states at 800-553-8082. Time may be limited to bring an NEC lawsuit. Call our attorneys right now.\n\nNEC Class Action Lawsuit Status Updates\n\nI know many of you are closely following the NEC baby formula lawsuit. So before we get into the substance of these lawsuits, let me give you a quick update on the latest in the litigation.\n\nMarch 3, 2025 \u2013 MDL Adds 63 New Cases\n\nWe got 63 new cases added to the NEC preterm infant formula MDL during the month of February. That is the highest monthly volume in awhile for this litigation and it brings the number of pending cases in the MDL up to 663.\n\nFebruary 11, 2025 \u2013 Motion for Summary Judgment in the MDL\n\nThe defendants in the NEC baby formula multidistrict litigation have moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs have failed to provide admissible expert testimony establishing that cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula causes necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. Their argument largely hinges on their effort to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, Dr. Logan Spector and Dr. Jennifer Sucre, under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. If successful, this would leave plaintiffs without the necessary expert testimony on general causation, which defendants argue is a fatal flaw requiring dismissal of all cases. But this is not likely.\n\nThis motion reads much like a \u201cWhy did you even file this lawsuit?\u201d, which ignores that judges and juries have already rejected similar defenses and ordered the formula makers to pay substantial verdicts. In March 2024, a St. Clair County, Illinois jury awarded $60 million in damages to the family of a preterm infant who developed NEC after being fed a cow\u2019s milk-based formula. Just a few months later, in July 2024, a Missouri jury returned a $495 million verdict against Abbott Laboratories, finding that their Similac formula contributed to a baby\u2019s NEC diagnosis. Defendants\u2019 motion seems to forget this.\n\nThe defense argument relies heavily on a report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Working Group, which stated that it is \u201cthe absence of human milk\u2014rather than exposure to formula\u201d\u2014that is associated with NEC. They also cite a joint statement from the FDA, CDC, and NIH, which concluded that there is \u201cno conclusive evidence that preterm infant formula causes NEC.\u201d\n\nBut finding some things that might support your claim does not mean you get summary judgment. Plaintiffs\u2019 response will point to a growing body of research and internal corporate documents suggesting that formula companies have long known about the risks but failed to warn doctors or parents. The summary judgment motion, if granted, would shut down every case in the MDL, but the litigation history\u2014including prior massive jury verdicts\u2014suggests otherwise.\n\nJanuary 26, 2025 \u2013 Motion to Exclude Expert\n\nAbbott Laboratories and other defendants in the Preterm Infant Nutrition MDL have moved to exclude Dr. Jennifer Sucre, an extremely highly qualified neonatologist, from presenting her opinions on the link between formula feeding and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.\n\nDr. Sucre is the real deal. She is a nationally recognized neonatologist and physician-scientist at Vanderbilt University, whose groundbreaking research bridges the gap between clinical care and cutting-edge science to improve outcomes for preterm infants. With a deep expertise in cellular mechanisms and preterm infant health, her peer-reviewed work has advanced critical understanding in neonatal medicine, making her a trusted authority in her field. Somehow, he defendants attempt to paint Dr. Sucre as unqualified, claiming her expertise in lung development diminishes her ability to testify on NEC, despite her medical credentials and her reliance on established biological mechanisms. They further dismiss her reliance on animal and in vitro studies, ignoring the ethical and practical limitations of conducting human trials on such a fragile population. Their strategy is clear: undermine a credible expert to limit the scope of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and shield themselves from accountability. You cannot blame the defendants for trying to get rid of Dr. Sucre before trial. They do not want the jury to hear her testimony because it will be very credible and damaging to them. January 24, 2025: Joint Status Report The Joint Status Report filed today in the MDL outlines a streamlined pretrial briefing schedule agreed upon by both parties to address Rule 702 motions (expert witness testimony) and dispositive motions. The purpose is to wisely reduce complexity and focus on key issues, deferring certain case-specific motions to trial-specific dates while proceeding with general causation motions and select expert challenges. Key elements include a staggered schedule for briefing motions related to general and case-specific experts, agreed page limits for filings, and plans to resolve disputes over supplemental reports and depositions. The parties have also set dates for motions in limine and the final pretrial conference for the first bellwether trial, emphasizing collaboration to avoid scheduling conflicts as the litigation progresses. Trial in the Mar case is set to begin on May 5, 2025.\n\nJanuary 9, 2025: Status Conference\n\nThere status conference in the MDL set today was postponed. It has not yet been reschedule.\n\nJanuary 8, 2025: Bellwether Trial Schedule\n\nThe dates for the first four bellwether trials:\n\nMay 5, 2025: Mar v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-00232 August 11, 2025: K.B. v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-05356 November 3, 2025: Brown v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-02001 February 2, 2026: Inman v. Mead Johnson & Company, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-0373\n\nThe hope is a global settlement before any of these trial begin. But we will see.\n\nJanuary 5, 2025: 6 Cases Added to MDL\n\nOnly 6 new preterm infant formula NEC cases were added to the MDL during the month of December. That is a notable decrease over the monthly volume we saw the prior 2 months. There are now 632 pending cases in the MDL.\n\nDecember 13, 2024: State Versus Federal Court\n\nThe Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has refused to remand a lawsuit to California state court, keeping the case within the NEC MDL consolidated in Illinois federal court. The suit alleges that Similac and Enfamil formulas for premature babies caused necrotizing enterocolitis after a child was fed the formula in a hospital shortly after birth in May 2014.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the child required surgery and continues to suffer long-term health consequences. The panel rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that federal subject jurisdiction was lacking, noting that such objections do not typically impede transfer.\n\nWhile this MDL progresses, state court cases involving NEC claims against Abbott and Mead Johnson have moved more quickly, resulting in three verdicts, including a $495 million total damages award in Missouri earlier this year and a $60 million verdict against Mead Johnson. So many plaintiffs, like this one, are looking hard at state court options.\n\nDecember 2, 2024: Case Update\n\nThe NEC infant formula MDL maintained its pace from October, adding 26 new cases again in November\u2014a 4.3% increase\u2014bringing the total to 626 cases. Because you are seeing verdicts in state court, more lawsuits are being filed in state court in recent months.\n\nNovember 26, 2024: Next Hearing\n\nJudge Pallmeyer has scheduled an in-court status hearing for December 19, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. The status hearing will likely address key issues, including the bellwether selection trial preparation updates, the progress of discovery, and, with any luck, settlement efforts. Both sides will present their view on trial readiness and any unresolved disputes that could impact the timeline.\n\nNovember 21, 2024: Reflections on First Loss\n\nThe recent defense win in Missouri highlights the unpredictable nature of jury trials. While the plaintiffs in that case faced a setback, the verdict is unlikely to halt the momentum of the broader NEC litigation. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys remain optimistic, pointing to the substantial compensatory and punitive damages awarded in prior state court trials as evidence of the litigation\u2019s overall strength.\n\nNovember 16, 2024: Donor Milk\n\nWe are seeing more NICUs prioritizing donor milk for preterm infants to reduce NEC risk. These decisions are influenced by the growing body of research linking NEC to cow milk. Does the NEC litigation also push them in the direction? Of course.\n\nNovember 1, 2024: First Loss in Missouri Trial Today\n\nThe defense verdict in Missouri yesterday will not slow the momentum of this litigation. In October, 26 new cases were added, bringing the total to over 600 pending cases. Many more are being filed in state court. Right now, the state court litigation is blowing past the MDL in terms of settling the tone of this litigation and that is causing more plaintiffs to file in state court.\n\nYesterday I was talking about the tea leaves pointing to a plaintiff\u2019s victory. You can never predict how a trial will turn out. Defendants go their first defense verdict in Whitfield. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer were certainly confident. They asked for $6 billion in punitive damages in closing statements.\n\nOctober 31, 2024: Trial Update\n\nThings are getting pretty crazy at the NEC baby formula trial in Missouri. A judge sanctioned Kirkland & Ellis partner James Hurst, barring him from presenting evidence or making closing arguments for the rest of the trial. The sanction came after Judge Michael Noble found Hurst in \u201cbad faith on several occasions,\u201d criticizing him for repeatedly violating court orders, allegedly to sway the jury unfairly. Hurst, representing Abbott Laboratories, is accused of introducing inflammatory evidence despite prior restrictions.\n\nJudge Noble noted that Hurst\u2019s actions seemed aimed at provoking a mistrial, describing his approach as \u201cdilatory litigation tactics\u201d potentially violating Missouri\u2019s legal ethics rules. This may be a canary in the coal mine for how this case will go. If Abbott is looking to get a mistrial, they cannot be happy with where this trial appears to be going.\n\nOctober 26 2024: Trial Continues\n\nWe are into the defense case in the Whitfield trial. Defense expert Dr. David Stevenson testified that he believes Kaine Whitfield, the child at the center of the case, has a genetic condition\u2014possibly Kabuki syndrome\u2014that could explain his intellectual impairments.\n\nThe family, of course, alleges his issues stem from necrotizing enterocolitis which they say was caused by Abbott\u2019s and Mead\u2019s cow-milk formulas given after the child\u2019s premature birth. The child also had significant bowel removal, resulting in short bowel syndrome, impacting his nutrient absorption.\n\nFun fact: Dr. Stevenson never bothered to evaluate the child to form his opinions.\n\nOctober 9, 2024: Status Conference Tomorrow\n\nAs we keep a hopeful eye on the Whitfield trial, there is a status conference tomorrow in the MDL. The key issues include:\n\nMotions Pending: There are several motions pending, including a motion by plaintiffs to dismiss non-cancer related cases without prejudice, a motion to enforce discovery orders against L\u2019Or\u00e9al that we have talked about, and motions to dismiss filed by multiple defendants (that are going nowhere). Bellwether Process: The parties are working on establishing a bellwether process to select representative cases for early trials we told you about yesterday. Defendant-Specific Discovery Issues: Several defendants, such as Strength of Nature and Namaste Laboratories, have pending motions related to document production and protective orders. Revlon has produced a significant number of documents in response to discovery requests, but plaintiffs are still reviewing these for completeness. \u201cSecond-Wave\u201d Defendants: Motions to dismiss have been filed by defendants like Advanced Beauty, John Paul Mitchell, and Wella Operations, with responses and replies being reviewed. Amendment to Case Management Order 10: The parties are working on an amendment to streamline the process of identifying and tracking plaintiffs, particularly those dismissed without prejudice, to ensure compliance and ease of re-filing if necessary.\n\nOctober 7, 2024: New NEC Trial\n\nOpening statements kicked off the latest NEC baby formula trial in Whitfield v. St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital. Testimony will continue today. See our October 1 update.\n\nWhat sets this case apart from the other two verdicts is that the doctors are being sued. Why would the doctors be responsible in these lawsuits? If the doctor is going to say on the witness stand, \u201cSure, we knew the risks, but we went ahead and fed the infant cow-milk formula anyway and did not bother to tell the parents of the risks,\u201d they are also responsible. This is particularly true if, like this case, the hospital had donor milk available as an option. What parent would not take donor milk if properly advised of the risks?\n\nNEC baby formula cases in the MDL have pinned blame squarely on the formula makers for not slapping a big, glaring warning label of the obvious risks of the product. But when the healthcare providers say it would not have mattered anyway, they will become defendants in these cases.\n\nOctober 3, 2024: \u201cThey Already Knew\u201d Defense\n\nOne of the defense arguments in this litigation that perplexes me is the idea that you did not have to warn because of the risk of NEC with baby formula because the hospitals already knew of the risk.\n\nThe argument ignores the primary purpose of a warning label, which is to inform all potential users\u2014not just specialized medical staff\u2014of the associated risks to enable informed decision-making. Warning labels are not just for hospitals. They are for parents, caregivers, and even other healthcare providers who may not be as familiar with the specific risks.\n\nBut it does deeper than that. By failing to include a warning, manufacturers are assuming that every single stakeholder already has complete knowledge of the risks. This assumption is unreasonable and places the burden entirely on healthcare providers to remember, communicate, and mitigate every risk without adequate support or resources. Moreover, even if some hospitals are aware of the risks, not all of them may be up-to-date on the most recent research, and a warning label would give them a heads-up to really consider the costs and the benefits of cow-based milk.\n\nOctober 1, 2024: MDL Case Totals\n\nThe NEC infant formula class action MDL added 27 new cases during the month of September. That brings the total number of cases in the MDL up to 598. After these two huge verdicts, you can expect more claims to be filed in the months to come.\n\nBut the energy in this litigation right now is not in the MDL. A new kicked off in Missouri yesterday. A family is suing Abbott, Reckitt, and St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital. The lawsuits claims their formulas caused their premature son \u2013 born at 28 weeks \u2013 to develop necrotizing enterocolitis in 2017. The family seeks compensation for the severe, permanent injuries her son continues to suffer.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024: Trial Dates in the MDL\n\nThe lawyers are expected to provide a joint submission on Friday of proposed trial dates.\n\nSeptember 23, 2024: NIH Funded Study on Donor Milk and NEC\n\nA National Institutes of Health-funded study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that extremely preterm infants fed donated human milk had half the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) compared to those fed formula (4.2% vs. 9%).\n\nThe study involved 483 infants born before 29 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 1,000 grams. While the donor milk-fed infants grew slightly slower than formula-fed infants, there were no significant differences in neurological development between the two groups as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 22 to 26 months corrected age.\n\nThe study provides strong scientific evidence that donor human milk reduces the risk of NEC in extremely preterm infants compared to formula feeding. In the context of NEC baby formula litigation, it bolsters plaintiffs\u2019 claims by highlighting the increased risk associated with formula feeding in this vulnerable population.\n\nSeptember 9, 2024: Junk Science\n\nPredictably, tort reform lobbyists are criticizing the two recent large NEC baby formula verdicts. A Missouri jury awarded $95 million in compensatory damages and $400 million in punitive damages, while a similar case in Illinois resulted in a $60 million verdict against Mead Johnson in March.\n\nThis article\u2019s main focus is an attack on the motives of trial lawyers, rather than engaging with the substance of the legal claims. Much of the content seems like a recycled argument from the last article on a different tort. The author leans on the familiar \u201cjunk science\u201d narrative without providing any explanation or evidence to support why this science is faulty. There really is meaningful junk science arguments in this litigation. The only substantive concern raised is the fear that manufacturers may stop producing formula for preterm infant. I agree, it is a valid worry. But it cannot justify discouraging meritorious lawsuits for children and families that have suffered so much. This is particularly true when all the defendants have to do to solve the problem moving forward is to warn doctors and parents of the obviously risk of NEC to premature babies so they can make an informed choice. That is it.\n\nAugust 26, 2024: Mar v. Abbott Laboratories Case Facts\n\nYesterday we told you the Mar case was up first. Let\u2019s talk about the facts of this wrongful death claim.\n\nIn January 2014, a premature baby was born at Summersville Regional Medical Center in West Virginia. Weighing just 3 pounds and measuring a little over 15 inches, she was immediately transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at CAMC Women and Children\u2019s Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia, where she received specialized care.\n\nInitially, the baby was fed exclusively on breast milk provided by her mother, who worked hard to pump and supply her milk. However, on January 14th and 15th, the hospital introduced Similac Special Care 24, a cow\u2019s milk-based product, into her feeding regimen. Shortly after, the baby developed severe symptoms, including a distended abdomen and bloody stool. She was diagnosed with NEC.\n\nThe situation rapidly worsened, and on January 15th, the baby had to undergo emergency surgery, where doctors found significant damage to her intestines, including necrosis (tissue death) and a perforation. Despite the medical interventions, the baby tragically passed away on January 16, 2014.\n\nAt the time of her death, the baby\u2019s parents had no idea that the cow\u2019s milk-based formula she had been fed may have caused or significantly contributed to the development of NEC. The baby\u2019s mother filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Abbott seeking justice for her daughter.\n\nAugust 25, 2024: Parties Agree On Order Of First Four Bellwether Trials\n\nThe parties have agreed on the order of the first four bellwether trials, pending the resolution of dispositive motions and reserving the right to seek summary judgment in any of these cases. This stipulation is submitted for the Court\u2019s consideration instead of the previously planned competing position papers. The proposed trial order is as follows:\n\nMar v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-00232) Diggs v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-05356) Etienne & Brown v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-02001) Inman v. Mead Johnson & Co. (Case No. 1:22-cv-03737)\n\nThe parties request that the August 29, 2024, Status Conference be held remotely instead of in-person, as initially planned. The parties will be available to address any questions the Court may have.\n\nAugust 17, 2024: Philadelphia Expected As Next Focal Point Of NEC Lawsuits\n\nNEC litigation has predominantly taken place in state courts and through federal claims within the Illinois MDL. The big verdict in St. Louis last month has now put a spotlight on Missouri as well.\n\nPhiladelphia is poised to become the next focal point, known for being a supportive venue for victims seeking justice. NEC baby formula lawsuits in Philadelphia are not consolidated, thus no class action exists\u2014each lawsuit is addressed on its own merits.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a distinct tactic NEC lawyers are using involves plaintiffs suing the hospitals, a move that complicates the defense for manufacturers like Mead Johnson and Abbott. Typically, defendants aim to align their defense strategies. Yet, the significant verdicts might tempt hospitals to distance themselves from manufacturers, blaming them for inadequate warnings about product risks.\n\nThe first trial in Philadelphia addressing NEC-related injuries from baby formula is anticipated to commence this spring.\n\nAugust 9, 2024: Mead Johnson Files Notice To Remove NEC Lawsuit To MDL In Illinois\n\nMead Johnson filed a notice to remove an NEC lawsuit to the MDL in Illinois.\n\nThe plaintiff, a Virginia resident, alleges that his premature infant daughter developed NEC and subsequently died after consuming Mead Johnson\u2019s preterm infant formula in 2007. The defendants argue that the case meets the criteria for federal jurisdiction due to diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a), 1441, and 1446, as the plaintiff and the Mead Johnson defendants are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n\nMead asserts that Abbott Laboratories and Abbott were fraudulently joined to prevent removal under the forum defendant rule since there is no claim that the child consumed any products manufactured by Abbott. The notice contends that Abbott\u2019s involvement is a sham to obstruct the removal process. The defendants emphasize that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Abbott have no reasonable possibility of success under Virginia law, which governs this case, because the injury and related events occurred in Virginia\n\nWhether this case is heard in Virginia or Illinois, Mead is going to have to offer a fair settlement or face a jury.\n\nJuly 31, 2024: Plaintiffs\u2019 Lawyers Granted Permission To Depose Five Individuals\n\nThings are still plodding along in the federal MDL. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were granted permission to depose five individuals by August 20, 2024:\n\nDan Achimov \u2013 Worked in portfolio management and product innovation, potentially holding information on the company\u2019s infant formula products, including those implicated in the NEC litigation.\n\n\u2013 Worked in portfolio management and product innovation, potentially holding information on the company\u2019s infant formula products, including those implicated in the NEC litigation. Brian Berg \u2013 A scientist associated with pre-clinical research on NEC and involved in product innovation at Mead Johnson, potentially providing insight into scientific studies and product development.\n\n\u2013 A scientist associated with pre-clinical research on NEC and involved in product innovation at Mead Johnson, potentially providing insight into scientific studies and product development. Craig Hadley \u2013 Former Head of Regulatory for Infant Formula and Child Nutrition Innovation, with knowledge about Mead Johnson\u2019s regulatory compliance and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n\n\u2013 Former Head of Regulatory for Infant Formula and Child Nutrition Innovation, with knowledge about Mead Johnson\u2019s regulatory compliance and interactions with regulatory agencies. Daniel Secada \u2013 Senior Vice President of Nutrition, sitting on Mead Johnson\u2019s Nutrition Leadership Team, possibly overseeing decisions related to infant formula products, including preterm infant formula development.\n\n\u2013 Senior Vice President of Nutrition, sitting on Mead Johnson\u2019s Nutrition Leadership Team, possibly overseeing decisions related to infant formula products, including preterm infant formula development. Justin Wells \u2013 A marketing executive involved in project management and potential partnerships related to the key issue of cow\u2019s milk formula alternatives, relevant to the litigation focusing on product content and marketing practices.\n\nThe court will maintain the existing deadline for the close of fact discovery on August 9, 2024, allowing for a potential limited extension if necessary for outstanding written discovery requests.\n\nThe order follows a dispute over delays in scheduling depositions and obtaining written discovery, which was partly due to Mead Johnson\u2019s involvement in a related state-court case. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers had served new discovery requests after the initial cutoff date, which Mead Johnson opposed, leading to ongoing discussions to resolve these outstanding issues.\n\nCertainly, the MDL court feels new pressure to move these cases along with these state court cases going to verdict.\n\nJuly 26, 2024: Missouri Jury Awards $495 Million In Damages\n\nThis litigation will never be the same. Today, a Missouri jury awarded a game changing $495 million in damages \u2013 $95 million in compensatory and $400 million in punitive damages \u2013 to an Illinois girl who developed necrotizing enterocolitis after consuming Abbott Laboratories\u2019 specialized formula for premature infants. Abbott and Mead dismissed the first verdict for $40 million as a fluke. They cannot do that anymore. Why Abbott let this case go to trial is hard to fathom. Abbott lost about $8 billion in value after the verdict in after hours trading. What had to freak out investors is that jury did not just find Abbott negligent. It awarded $400 million in damages. That can only mean the jurors were disgusted by what Abbott did. That is the canary in the coal mine of where this litigation is going. If Mead and Abbott have any sense, they will try to settle as many NEC baby formula lawsuits as they possibly can.\n\nJuly 19, 2024: Abbott CEO Contemplated Withdrawing Premature Infant Formula From Market\n\nAbbott CEO Robert Ford says the company is contemplating the possibility of withdrawing its premature infant formula for premature babies from the market amid legal and safety concerns.\n\nOf course, Ford called for public health officials to take action, emphasizing that the formula is vital for neonatal intensive care units. He criticized the lawsuits, labeling the claims as lacking merit and scientific support. There is another path and Ford knows it. If they put an honest warning label on the product, rather than pulling it from the market, they can continue to make money off the product and eliminate any future lawsuits moving forward. It just requires transparency about the risks so parents can make an informed choice.\n\nJuly 11, 2024: First Trial Against Abbott For Infant Formula Begins In Missouri\n\nThe first trial against Abbott for infant formula designed for premature babies began in Missouri, with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney arguing that Abbott\u2019s cow\u2019s milk-based formula, sold under the Similac brand, caused a plaintiff\u2019s daughter to develop necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nThis is a huge trial that will have a bellwether effect the NEC settlement amounts throughout the litigation. This trial follows a similar case where a jury awarded $60 million to a mother whose premature baby died after receiving Enfamil infant formula made by Mead Johnson, marking the first NEC-related verdict. See the March 15 update below.\n\nJune 30, 2024: New Lawsuit Filed In NEC MDL\n\nA new NEC lawsuit was filed on Friday alleging that a prematurely born infant at Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, developed severe health complications after being fed cow\u2019s milk-based products. The infant, born on June 19, 2002, was given products including Enfamil Premature Infant Formula and Enfamil Human Milk Fortifier shortly after birth.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, shortly after consuming these cow\u2019s milk-based products, the infant developed NEC. The condition, as it usually does, led to severe complications, necessitated surgery, and resulted in ongoing negative long-term health effects for the child.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that the NEC and subsequent health issues have caused significant financial and economic losses, as well as emotional distress. They also claim that they were not informed of the risks associated with feeding cow\u2019s milk-based products to preterm infants. The lawsuit alleges that if the mother had been aware of the potential health risks, she would not have allowed these products to be used.\n\nIt is noteworthy that NEC lawyers continue to file lawsuits for victims whose injuries occurred over twenty years ago. These are viable claims, but the challenge in many of these cases is finding the medical records from that time to support them.\n\nJune 29, 2024: NEC MDL Schedule Moving Forward\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the schedule moving forward:\n\nEvent Date Close of fact discovery August 9, 2024 Parties to submit position papers regarding the representativeness of the trial selections August 23, 2024 Plaintiffs to submit reports of general experts and case-specific experts in all trial selections September 25, 2024 Defendants to submit reports of general experts and case-specific experts in all trial selections October 28, 2024 Parties to submit rebuttal expert reports November 15, 2024 Depositions of experts November 4, 2024 through January 10, 2025 Summary judgment and/or Daubert motions (for all trial selections) January 24, 2025 Responses to summary judgment and/or Daubert motions February 28, 2025 Replies in support of summary judgment and/or Daubert motions March 14, 2025 Hearing(s) on summary judgment and/or Daubert motions March 24, 2025 Final pretrial conference in first bellwether trial April 17, 2025 Start of first bellwether trial May 5, 2025\n\nJune 17, 2024: NEC Test Trial To Begin May 5th 2025\n\nThe first NEC baby formula test trial in the MDL will be on May 5, 2025.\n\nMay 30, 2024: New NEC Lawsuit Filed This Week Highlights The Fact That Many NEC Cases Occurred Long Ago\n\nA NEC lawsuit filed this week underscores that many of these cases occurred long ago. This case involves a premature infant born at 32 weeks and 6 days gestation on May 29, 2004, at Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas. Weighing less than six pounds at birth, the infant was admitted to the NICU (Level II) and initially placed on low-volume D10W. The infant was fed Enfamil Premature 20, a cow\u2019s milk-based formula, via continuous feedings.\n\nAround June 1, 2004, the infant developed symptoms indicative of NEC, including emesis with abdominal distention, bloody stools, and x-ray imaging revealing dilated loops of bowel pneumatosis and portal air. Diagnosed with NEC, the infant was immediately taken off formula feedings, received blood transfusions, and was prescribed double antibiotics.\n\nDue to worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, and increasing abdominal distension, the infant required intubation from June 3 to June 7, 2004. Subsequently, the infant was transferred to Texas Children\u2019s Hospital NICU for continued management and remained there until being discharged home on July 23, 2004.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the infant\u2019s mother was unaware that the cow\u2019s milk-based formula could cause NEC, holding the formula manufacturers accountable for the severe health complications that ensued.\n\nMay 15, 2024: MDL Judge Kept Nevada NEC Lawsuit In Illinois State Court\n\nIn a new opinion, the MDL judge kept a Nevada NEC lawsuit in Illinois state court, where it was originally filed. The claim at issue is a classic NEC lawsuit. A child was born prematurely and given Mead\u2019s formula at a Nevada hospital, leading to a diagnosis of NEC and significant medical interventions, including extensive bowel removal. The child has spastic cerebral palsy.\n\nThe backstory is an NEC lawsuit was originally filed in Illinois state court, believing that Mead maintained its principal place of business there. However, after Mead transferred the case to federal court in Nevada, it was eventually sent back to Illinois for consolidated pretrial proceedings as part of MDL No. 3026.\n\nTwo years into the case, the plaintiffs\u2019 NEC lawyers found new evidence suggesting potential negligence by Nevada medical staff in treating the plaintiff\u2019s child. This led to a motion to amend the complaint to include these staff as defendants and remand the case to state court due to a lack of complete diversity.\n\nAs the case evolved, an expert\u2019s testimony pointing to the radiologist for a delay in the diagnosis of NEC led to the inclusion of that doctor as a defendant. The destroyed complete diversity of citizenship and potentially remand the case to state court.\n\nThere are different views about whether MDL or Illinois state court is the better venue for an NEC lawsuit. Certainly, the recent $60 million verdict helped push many attorneys into the state court camp.\n\nMay 8, 2024: MDL Judge Issues New CMO To Encourage Cautious Naming Of Defendants\n\nMany plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are reflexively naming both defendants in NEC lawsuits. The MDL judge, wanting to force victims\u2019 lawyers to be more circumspect in who is named as a defendant, has issued a new case management order specifically targeting the involvement of Mead Johnson & Company. The Order stipulated the company should only be named in cases where there is clear evidence that the infant consumed their manufactured or distributed products.\n\nThe court outlines specific protocols for identifying such products. Before filing a lawsuit, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys must thoroughly review all the infant\u2019s medical and feeding records from birth through discharge to verify product usage. If these records do not conclusively show Mead Johnson\u2019s products were used, attorneys must engage in further investigation to obtain this proof.\n\nFailure to properly identify Mead Johnson products or comply with these protocols can result in dismissal from the lawsuit. The order emphasizes thorough pre-suit diligence by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to ensure only relevant cases involving Mead Johnson proceed in this NEC baby formula MDL.\n\nApril 5, 2024: New Lawyers Enter Their Appearances For Mead Johnson In MDL\n\nA lot of new lawyers entered their appearances for Mead Johnson this week in the MDL. Could it be a coincidence? Sure. But I like to think they are rattled by that $60 million verdict.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: Illinois State Court Jury Awards $60 Million To Plaintiffs In NEC Lawsuit\n\nAn Illinois state court jury awarded $60 million to plaintiffs in a state court NEC lawsuit against Mead Johnson. The jury found that the company did not adequately warn of the risks of NEC associated with its cow\u2019s milk-based formula for premature infants and that failure to warn led to a child\u2019s death.\n\nThis is the first NEC failure-to-warn lawsuit to go to trial. This landmark decision is bound to bring new attention to this litigation. The jury sent a real message. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers asked for $25 million, and the jury awarded $60 million. It is hard to imagine a stronger statement.\n\nMarch 7, 2024: MDL Judge Tells NEC Lawyers She Is Willing To Monitor Depositions To Assure Compliance\n\nJudge Rebecca Pallmeyer told NEC baby formula lawyers she was willing to monitor depositions to assure compliance. The problem for plaintiffs in most MDLs is corporate witnesses who will not answer questions. Certainly, having a federal judge listening to your deposition testimony has a chilling impact on the urge to be noncompliant. The judge encouraged the parties to communicate any difficulties during depositions and reiterated her availability to assist as needed.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: Four Bellwether Cases Selected To Go To Trial\n\nFour critical \u201cbellwether\u201d cases have been selected to go to trial in the NEC class action lawsuit in federal court, providing insights into how juries might react to evidence presented in all related lawsuits. These trials involve cases of infant death and severe complications due to NEC after being fed the formulas. While the first trial date hasn\u2019t been set, they are expected to begin by 2024. The outcomes of these bellwether trials could influence potential settlements or further individual trials.\n\nYou would think and hope that a NEC formula settlement will happen before, during, or immediately after this stretch of trials. I think Mead and Abbott would be foolish to let even one of these lawsuits go forward. If plaintiffs get a huge verdict, it will be hard to put the genie back into the bottle regarding settlement amount expectations.\n\nBut what if they do not settle after these four bellwether trials? If no settlements are reached after the initial four trial dates, Judge Pallmeyer will likely send many individual cases back to various U.S. District Courts nationwide for their own trial dates.\n\nAugust 21, 2023: Peyton v. Abbott Filed Directly Into NEC MDL\n\nPeyton v. Abbott, a new NEC lawsuit, was directly filed into the MDL (1:22-cv-00071) in Illinois on Friday. This lawsuit addresses the harm and injuries endured by a mother and her minor child from NEC. The child has faced extensive health challenges due to consuming a bovine-milk-based infant formula produced by Abbott Laboratories Inc. The child developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after being fed Abbott\u2019s cows\u2019 milk-based formula. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit underscores the effort Abbott made to promote the idea that Similac products are similar to breast milk, marketing Similac as an optimal option for infants.\n\nAnticipating a potential statute of limitations defense because the case is 17 years old, Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers alleged that because of Abbott\u2019s deceptive advertising and insufficient warnings, the Plaintiffs were unaware that using its cow milk-based formula could considerably heighten the risk of NEC. The mother only became aware of this risk within two years of filing her lawsuit.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Statute of Limitations Issues Expected To Be A Battle In Some NEC Lawsuits\n\nThe issue of the statute of limitations will be a battle in some NEC lawsuits. While we\u2019re confident plaintiffs\u201d are on the right side of this issue in most, if not all, claims, it will be a complex battle in certain cases.\n\nA San Francisco Superior Court judge has tentatively approved Abbott Laboratories\u2019 motion to dismiss sixteen lawsuits related to NEC baby formula. The judge\u2019s decision offers parents the chance to revise and refile their complaint and the battle with renew. Lawyers for the parents maintain that the two-year timeframe to file their complaints should commence only when they recognize the alleged problems with the formula. This stance tracks with established legal principles of fundamental fairness\u2014who do you sue when the basis for your lawsuit has been kept from you?\n\nJune 28, 2023: Hayes v. Mead Johnson & Co Transferred Into NEC MDL\n\nHayes v. Mead Johnson & Co, LLC, et al. (3:23-cv-62) is one of the most recent cases to be transferred into the NEC infant formula class action MDL. The case was originally filed in the Southern District of Indiana by Sandra Smith, as guardian of Adam Smith.\n\nAdam Smith was born very prematurely (23 weeks) in April 2003. After his birth, Adam was given Enfamil Premature 24 formula, a cow\u2019s milk-based product made by Mead Johnson. Adam was given the formula 28 times in the first month of his life.\n\nDuring that time, he developed various symptoms of gastrointestinal distress. He was diagnosed with NEC and had to undergo surgery to remove a section of his bowel, and continues to live with various complications. (The case is a matter of public record, but we did change the last names.)\n\nApril 25, 2022: Final Case-Specific Discovery Plan Approved For Bellwether Cases\n\nThe final case-specific discovery plan has been approved for the pool of 12 bellwether cases in the NEC formula class action MDL. The discovery protocols permit each side to conduct depositions of case-specific factual witnesses and treating doctors in each of the 12 cases. Once this process is completed, 4 out of the 12 cases will be selected for the opening round of bellwether trials. A final pre-trial conference is currently set for March 11, 2024, at which time the initial trial date will be finalized.\n\nApril 1, 2023: Study From Emory University Suggest African-American Infants Are More Likely To Suffer From NEC\n\nA depressing but not surprising new study from Emory University suggests that African-American infants born prematurely are more likely to suffer from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and die from it than white infants. Our clients in the NEC litigation are disproportionately minorities, so the study confirms what we see on the ground.\n\nThis study underscores healthcare disparities and a lack of access to human donor milk in certain communities, which may increase the incidence of black preemie infants developing the disease from infant formula.\n\nJanuary 17, 2023: 97 Total Pending Cases In NEC MDL\n\nNine new infant formula NEC lawsuits were filed and transferred into the NEC class action MDL over the last month. There are now a total of 97 NEC formula lawsuits pending in the MDL. This number represents the total plaintiff population (other than those in state court) because there is no claim registry in this MDL.\n\nIs this even close to the total number of NEC baby formula lawsuits we can expect? No. Our firm has more than 97 NEC clients. But this litigation will be small. This may help plaintiffs get reasonable NEC lawsuit settlements. Why? Smaller litigation is less burdensome for the defendants, who can make reasonable settlement payouts without destroying the company\u2019s profitability. These defendants are making a fortune selling baby formula. There is plenty of money left over to pay fair settlement amounts to children who have suffered these awful injuries from NEC.\n\nJanuary 6, 2023: Judge Plans On Holding Science Day In NEC Class Action\n\nJudge Pallmeyer is planning to hold a \u201cscience day\u201d in the NEC infant formula class action lawsuit. Science days are common in complex mass torts. They give lawyers for both sides in the litigation the chance to make presentations aimed at educating the MDL judge on the scientific evidence and issues involved in the cases. Judge Pallmeyer is requiring the parties to provide potential dates for the NEC science day at the upcoming January status conference.\n\nNovember 11, 2022: Eight Cases Identified For Participation In Bellwether Program\n\nEight cases have already been identified for participation in the bellwether program in the infant formula NEC class action MDL. The defendants will pick four more cases to be included in this group by the end of the month. The MDL Judge recently issued an Order formally approving the fact sheet form that each of the plaintiffs in these 12 bellwether cases will be required to complete and submit. The fact sheet will be the first step in the bellwether discovery process. Depositions of witnesses and experts will follow.\n\nNovember 7, 2022: 29 Pending Cases Remanded To State Courts In PA\n\nThe judge in the NEC pre-term infant formula MDL granted a motion to remand 29 pending cases back down to state courts in Pennsylvania. The motion was granted because these claims involved claims against not just the formula manufacturers, but also the local hospitals that fed to the formula to the infants.\n\nThe presence of these local hospitals as defendants in the cases meant that the requirements for diversity jurisdiction in federal court were not met and, therefore, the cases were subject to remand. Following the removal of these 29 cases, there are now 106 pending cases in the NEC formula MDL.\n\nOctober 8, 2022: Bellwether Case Selection Process\n\nIn the NEC baby formula MDL, the judge has received a list of 66 potential NEC cases. From this list, the court will randomly select four cases to be included in the bellwether candidate pool.\n\nThis pool will consist of 12 cases in total: four chosen by the plaintiffs, four chosen by the defendants, and four randomly selected by the court. These 12 cases will then undergo fact discovery. Afterward, each side will select two cases from this group for bellwether test trials.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022: NEC Judge Issues First Significant CMO\n\nLast week, the Judge in the infant formula NEC class action MDL issued her first significant case management order. Amended CMO No.7 sets the rules and time frame for selecting bellwether test cases for discovery and trials. The first step will involve the selection of a pool of 12 \u201cbellwether discovery\u201d cases to serve as potential candidates for test trials. Why is this a big deal? You never get close to a settlement in litigation like this without the pressure of a trial date.\n\nThe plaintiffs, defendants, and the court each select 4 cases to comprise this initial pool of 12 and this process will be completed by November 23, 2022. So it is just months away. Once finalized, the 12 cases will then go through a brief fact discovery process so both sides can learn more about the cases. Once fact discovery wraps up, four cases will be selected from the pool of 12 and these 4 cases will be the initial bellwether trial cases. The bellwether trials will be scheduled 12 weeks apart and will alternate between defense pick and plaintiff pick.\n\nAugust 20, 2022: NEC Attorneys Propose Plan For Bellwether Candidate Pool\n\nAttorneys in the NEC baby formula MDL submitted a proposed plan for the selection of a pool of bellwether candidate cases. The plan to choose which cases go to trial first is similar to what mass tort lawyers typically see in other class action lawsuits\n\nUnder the draft order, the parties will provide the court with a list of 12 NEC lawsuits for the bellwether discovery pool, with even numbers of cases involving both Abbott and Mead Johnson.\n\nOnce the pool of 12 lawsuits is selected, they will go through pre-trial fact discovery. Once discovery is completed, both sides will get to select two initial bellwether trial cases for a total of four test trials.\n\nYou can guess how this works. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will pick the NEC lawsuits that have the best facts and are the most likely to win at trial and defense attorneys will pick the weakest cases that are most likely to lead to a defense verdict.\n\nJuly 27, 2022: New Study Underscores Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim for a Warning\n\nNEC remains one of the leading causes of death among premature infants, according to a new medical study recently published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The study concluded that premature babies diagnosed with NEC increased their chances of dying by a factor of 7. Even for those infants who survive NEC, however, the study found that a majority face permanent disabilities and prolonged medical care.\n\nJuly 19, 2022: New Guidelines From AAP\n\nAs concerns and lawsuits continue to grow around the link between NEC and bovine infant formula, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued new guidelines that recommend that parents avoid infant formula entirely for new babies. The new guidance urges hospitals to stop allowing the promotion of infant formula products and focus on emphasizing breastfeeding instead.\n\nMay 23, 2022: 52 Total Cases Active In NEC MDL\n\nThe Formula NEC MDL (In re: Abbott Laboratories, et al., Preterm Infant Nutrition Prod. Liab. Lit.\u2013 MDL No. 3026) is formally underway in the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer held her first status conference on May 19 and will make selections for the plaintiffs\u2019 Lead Counsel, Liaison Counsel, and leadership committee this week. As of May 16, a total of 52 active cases have been consolidated into the MDL. That number will likely triple over the next month.\n\nMay 4, 2022: NEC Lawsuits Move Forward\n\nThese lawsuits are moving forward. Our NEC baby formula lawyers are surprised by the number of parents we hear from every day interested in filing an NEC formula lawsuit. Our attorneys are finding that the most viable lawsuits are the ones where the child was born after 2011. The biggest problem our law firm is seeing with older claims is that finding the medical records can be a challenge. The more recent cases are also better because the warning argument that parents and doctors should have been told of the risks gets stronger every year after 1990. Still, our lawyers are reviewing necrotizing enterocolitis lawsuits as far back as 2001.\n\nApril 8, 2022: MDL Panel Certifies New MDL NEC Baby Formula Class Action Lawsuit\n\nThe MDL Panel has certified a new MDL NEC baby formula class action lawsuit. This means any NEC lawsuit filed in federal court will be transferred to Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, a U.S. District Court Judge in Illinois. This development will help push these lawsuits out of second gear, pushing us towards a trial date that may push Abbott and Mead to offer reasonable settlement amounts for an NEC formula lawsuit.\n\n\n\nApril 6, 2022: Illinois Supreme Court Grants Request To Consolidate About 20 NEC Formula Cases\n\nThe Supreme Court of Illinois previously granted a request to consolidate a group of about 20 NEC formula cases pending in Illinois state courts before a single judge (Dennis Ruth) in the Circuit Court for Madison County. This effectively created a mini-MDL at the state court level. Now, however, Abbott is seeking to have the consolidated cases transferred from Madison County to either Cook County (Chicago) or Lake County, under the doctrine of forum nonconveniens (inconvenient forum). The reason the Illinois lawsuits matter is because lawsuits filed in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, or any other state might well find their way to Illinois state court. So if you hire an NEC lawyer far away from Illinois, your baby formula lawsuit may end up in front of Judge Ruth in Madison County, Illinois.\n\nMarch 6, 2022: Public Gets Closer Look At Formula Manufacturers Following Similac Recall\n\nAfter the Similac recall debacle, Americans are getting a closer look at how baby formula manufacturers put profits ahead of people \u2013 and how the FDA is not built to keep these companies in check. This helps the NEC lawsuits because it shines a disturbing spotlight on how the sausage gets made and how federal regulators mind the store.\n\nFebruary 14, 2022: Enfamil Joins Abbott In Support Of Request For NEC Class Action\n\nLast week, the manufacturer of Enfamil (Mead Johnson) joined Abbott in support of the request for an NEC baby formula class action lawsuit for all NEC claims in federal court. This is a good development for plaintiffs who are hoping to avoid active litigation on their infant formula lawsuit. The big point of contention is which court will handle the MDL class action. The defendants want U.S. District Court in Connecticut. Why? Their motions did a poor job of explaining that. Baby formula lawyers for victims prefer the Northern District of Illinois for obvious reasons: both Mead and Abbott are headquartered near Chicago.\n\nFebruary 3, 2022: Possible State Court Class-Action In Illinois\n\nOur NEC lawyers are still waiting to see if there will also be a state court class-action lawsuit in Illinois. The Illinois Supreme Court has yet to rule. There may be two baby formula class actions pending in Illinois at one time: one in state court and the other in federal court. The formula defendants will likely consent to this class action just like they did the federal MDL.\n\nJanuary 27, 2022: Medical Literature Supports Plaintiffs\u2019 Contentions\n\nThe medical literature continues to support the contentions made by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the toxic infant formula NEC lawsuits. This new article underscores the risks associated with NEC and cow milk.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022: Abbott Files Petition To Consolidate NEC Lawsuits Into MDL\n\nAbbott filed a petition with the JPML requesting that all NEC infant formula lawsuits be consolidated into a new MDL. Abbott requested that the MDL be created in the District of Connecticut and assigned to Hon. Stefan Underwood.\n\nBaby Formulas Are Linked to NEC in Premature Babies\n\nBabies born prematurely require extra nutrition to boost their development and growth.\n\nMany premature infants, however, are not able to breastfeed feed. So they are generally given baby formula instead. Similac and Enfamil are the two leading brands of infant formula.\n\nFeeding Preterm Infants\n\nHistorically, there have been three primary types of nutrition for preterm babies: parenteral nutrition for feed intolerance (such as a feeding tube), human milk (either the mother\u2019s own milk or donor milk), and cow\u2019s milk-based formulas and fortifiers. Cow\u2019s milk-based products were once believed to be beneficial for the growth of premature, low-birth-weight babies.\n\nCow Milk Problem\n\nMost baby formulas, such as Similac and Enfamil, are made from cow milk with various nutrients and ingredients added to mimic human breast milk. While cow milk products were effective in quickly increasing the weight of these infants, recent scientific advancements have revealed strong links between cow\u2019s milk-based products and necrotizing enterocolitis, an undeniably serious condition that can cause death in preterm and severely preterm, low-weight infants.\n\nIn response to these recent and not-so-recent findings, alternative fortifiers derived from human milk and non-bovine-based products have been developed. Despite the established causal connection between cow\u2019s milk-based products and NEC, manufacturers, including the defendants, have not made significant changes to their products, packaging, guidelines, instructions, or warnings. They continue to promote and sell cow\u2019s milk-based versions, ignoring the potential harm to vulnerable preterm infants.\n\nWhile making tons of money, the manufacturers of these infant formulas have conveniently ignored the science over the last 30 years. That science shows that cow milk formulas cause bacterial septic overload in the stomach of premature babies that can cut holes in their bowels and cause bleeding and infection.\n\nNEC Treatment\n\nNEC can be mild in some infants and extremely serious in others. The first step in the treatment of NEC is to stop all oral feedings and begin the baby on an aggressive course of antibiotics.\n\nNutrients will then be administered intravenously. If the infection is not stopped quickly enough, it may leave dead tissue in the baby\u2019s intestines. If this occurs, surgery may be necessary to remove the dead intestinal tissue and repair any perforations.\n\nNEC Can Be Life-Threatening\n\nEven a mild case of NEC can be very dangerous and potentially life-threatening for a premature baby. Between 15-40% of premature infants with NEC die. The main reason for this is that NEC can lead to a fatal blood infection called sepsis.\n\nWhen NEC destroys the baby\u2019s intestinal tissue, it allows bacteria to leak out of the intestine into the abdominal cavity.\n\nThis type of infection is called peritonitis, and if not immediately and effectively treated, it will eventually allow the infection to enter the baby\u2019s bloodstream and become sepsis.\n\nVideo on NEC lawsuit settlement amounts\n\nNEC Consequences\n\nEven when NEC is not fatal, it can cause other long-term or permanent complications and adverse health consequences. One of every 3 babies with NEC will develop intestinal strictures.\n\nThis is a narrowing of the intestine. Intestinal strictures can make it difficult for food to pass through and may require surgery to correct. If NEC results in surgical removal of intestinal tissue, it can cause short bowel syndrome and impact the baby\u2019s development and growth.\n\nNEC in Premature Infants Caused by Enfamil or Similac\n\nNEC only occurs in 1 out of every 2,000 full-term live births in the U.S. In premature births, however, the condition is much more common. NEC occurs in about 10% of all premature babies (born 37 weeks or earlier).\n\nAlthough the exact cause of NEC is not fully understood, many scientific and clinical studies definitively prove that cow-milk-based infant formulas, such as Similac and Enfamil, significantly increase the risk of a premature infant developing NEC.\n\nBut the risk of Ninth premature babies has long been clear. For years, the American Academy of Pediatrics told us that human breast milk is the best path for preemies because of the risk of NEC from baby formula. Any newborn NEC baby formula lawsuit will focus on this medical literature and ask why Abbott and Mead did not give a warning.\n\nLancet Study\n\nIn 1990, a seminal study published in The Lancet by Dr. Alan Lucas and colleagues examined the relationship between infant feeding methods and the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. The multicenter study involved over 500 preterm infants with birth weights less than 1850 grams. The infants were randomly assigned to receive either human breast milk (from their mothers or donors) or standard bovine-based infant formula.\n\nThe researchers found a striking difference in the incidence of NEC between the two groups. Infants fed exclusively on formula were significantly more likely to develop NEC compared to those fed human milk. Specifically, the study reported that formula-fed babies were up to six to ten times more likely to develop NEC than those receiving breast milk. The protective effect of human milk was attributed to its unique components, such as immunoglobulins, growth factors, and anti-inflammatory agents, which are not present in bovine formula. This study was one of the first to suggest a strong link between bovine-based formulas and an increased risk of NEC, emphasizing the critical importance of human milk in the diet of preterm infants.\n\nJournal of Pediatrics Study\n\nApproximately ten years later, in 1999, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics by Dr. Richard Schanler and colleagues reinforced the findings of the earlier Lancet study. This research focused on extremely low birth weight infants and compared the outcomes of those fed with human breast milk (supplemented with human milk fortifiers) to those fed with preterm infant formula derived from bovine milk.\n\nThe study found that infants who received breast milk or human milk fortifiers were 90% less likely to develop NEC compared to those fed with traditional bovine-based formula. The data showed a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC among infants receiving human milk products, highlighting the protective role of human milk fortifiers when added to breast milk. These fortifiers provided the necessary nutrients to support the growth and development of preterm infants without the increased risk associated with bovine proteins.\n\nFurther strengthening these conclusions, two additional studies published in 2013 offered more definitive evidence on the link between NEC and bovine formulas. One of these studies, appearing in The Journal of Pediatrics, demonstrated that an exclusive human milk diet\u2014including human milk-based fortifiers\u2014significantly reduced the incidence of NEC and surgical NEC compared to diets that included bovine-based products. Another study published the same year corroborated these findings, showing that the use of bovine-based fortifiers increased the risk of NEC even when added to human milk.\n\nCollectively, these studies have had a profound impact on neonatal nutrition practices. They underscore the importance of providing human milk to preterm infants and have led to increased advocacy for the use of donor human milk and human milk-based fortifiers in neonatal intensive care units. The research has also played a critical role in the ongoing NEC baby formula litigation by providing scientific evidence of the risks associated with bovine-based infant formulas. Did the companies warn doctors and parents about these concerns? No.\n\nNew NEC British Medicine Study\n\nA study published on October 14, 2021, in the British Medical Journal, adds new fuel to any necrotizing enterocolitis formula lawsuit. The study suggests that the makers of infant formulas such as Similac and Enfamil have funded biased and unreliable clinical product trials. The researchers found that the infant formula trials showed a \u201cuniversal lack of transparency\u201d and may have downplayed the risks of NEC associated with their cow-milk formula products.\n\nMore NEC Formula Studies\n\nEvidence-Based Feeding Strategies Before and After the Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. July 2014). Here is the key quote: \u201cNecrotizing enterocolitis (N.E.C.) is a devastating disease of premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. It is well established that the risk is increased by the administration of infant formula.\u201d This will be a key study in any NEC baby formula lawsuit.\n\nAnother round of clinical study results was published in 2016 (Beyond Necrotizing Enterocolitis Prevention \u2013 Breastfeeding Medicine ) and 2017 (Human milk is the feeding strategy to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis \u2013 Semin Perinatol.). This language here is pretty unambiguous: \u201cExtremely premature infants who received an exclusive HUM [Human Milk] diet had a significantly lower incidence of NEC and mortality. The HUM group also had a reduction in late-onset sepsis, BPD, and ROP. This multicenter study further emphasizes the many benefits of an exclusive HUM diet, and demonstrates multiple improved outcomes after implementation of such a feeding protocol.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Cochrane (an independent healthcare research group) released the results of the most comprehensive study to date comparing health results for premature babies fed with bovine formula versus human milk. The results of the Cochrane study put to rest any lingering debate about the existence of a causal relationship between cow-milk-based formulas and NEC in premature infants. This study underscores the risk to babies with NEC.\n\nMakers of Similac and Enfamil Failed to Warn About the NEC Risks\n\nSimilac is manufactured and sold by Abbott Laboratories Inc., a large medical device and healthcare product company based in Illinois. You have likely heard of them. You are less likely to have heard of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, the company that makes Enfamil. But it is a 16 billion-dollar company.\n\nAbbott and Mead were well aware of the scientific evidence that their cow-milk-based formulas caused a significantly increased risk of NEC in premature infants. Despite being well aware of the link between their formulas and the risk of NEC, Abbott and Mead deliberately chose not to include a warning label about the NEC risk on their product labeling.\n\nChanging the warning for a baby formula under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not difficult. (It is a lot easier to change a warning under the FDCA than it is to change, for example, a warning on a drug.)\n\nSo why not add a warning? Well, let\u2019s start by saying our lawyers do not know yet. These toxic baby formula NEC lawsuits are just beginning. But, it is easy to make a prediction based on the facts already on the ground: follow the money. A warning will lead to fewer sales. Fewer sales lead to fewer profits and few yachts. We all know the story, right?\n\nFaced with growing scientific proof that their formulas presented an increased risk for premature infants to develop NEC, Mead and Abbott continue to market their products as safe and failed to warn consumers about this risk.\n\nNEC Lawsuits Against Baby Formula Makers\n\nA growing number of parents and preemies who were fed with Similac and Enfamil formula and subsequently developed NEC are filing product liability lawsuits against the formula manufacturers (Abbott and Mead) for negligent failure to warn.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Abbott and Mead had a duty to warn about the risks of NEC and their baby formula products but deliberately failed to include any such warning while continuing to market their products as safe.\n\nWhat Are Expected NEC Baby Formula Lawsuits Settlement Compensation Amounts? These NEC baby formula product liability lawsuits are new. But families have been filing medical malpractice lawsuits in necrotizing enterocolitis lawsuits for years. So the settlement compensation in these lawsuits, if successful, has a history that can guide us in determining possible settlement amounts in these lawsuits.\n\nThe average verdict in a successful NEC preemie lawsuit is in the millions of dollars. Our baby formula lawyers anticipate similar compensation payouts if plaintiffs win these trials.\n\nBut our lawyers do not expect to see Similac lawsuits or Enfamil lawsuits going to trial. We could be wrong. But our attorneys think the makers of these baby formulas will seek an out-of-court global settlement of as many NEC lawsuits as they can.\n\nBut settlement amounts and trial amounts are not the same things. So even if the makers of Similac and Enfamil predicted an average jury verdict compensation payout of $2 million per individual case, it would not mean the average settlement amount would be $2 million. Why? A settlement is a compromise.\n\nAre Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Baby Formula Lawsuit a Class Action Lawsuit? Yes, there is a class action NEC lawsuit pending in Illinois. This means that if you file in federal court in New York, Texas, California, or any other state, your NEC baby formula lawsuit be transferred to federal court in Illinois. But there are also cases pending in state court in states such as Missouri and Illinois.\n\nBut the infant formula claims may become a class action, albeit one that does not have thousands of plaintiffs. And while the size of the lawsuits could be smaller, the settlement amounts could be huge. Because the injuries are so extreme in many NEC cases, the average individual settlement compensation payout in the baby formula lawsuits could be extraordinary.\n\nExample NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit\n\nJust to give you some context, let\u2019s look at an example NEC lawsuit.\n\nLate last year, an NEC infant formula lawsuit was filed in the County Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois against Mead Johnson & Company LLC and Mead Nutrition Company, alleging negligence and other claims.\n\nThe complaint in this NEC lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s baby was born prematurely in 2013. Initially, the baby was \u201cdoing well\u201d on her mother\u2019s breast milk and was progressing normally. Two weeks after birth, the baby was fed Enfamil cow-milk-based formula for several days. The lawsuit claims that the formula caused the baby to develop NEC which required \u201caggressive medical intervention.\u201d\n\nSadly, the baby died a week later from complications related to the NEC. The complaint alleges failure to warn what we have been talking about. The lawsuit alleges Mead Johnson knew about the dangers of its bovine-based formula and failed to provide adequate warnings about the risk of NEC associated with the formula.\n\nWhy is this NEC baby formula lawsuit not barred by the statute of limitations given the child was born in 2013? I talk about this below.\n\nMini MDL NEC Class Action Lawsuit Sought in Illinois\n\nSince February 2021, 33 NEC baby formula lawsuits have filed been in Illinois state courts. Why is Illinois has become a hot spot for the emerging NEC formula litigation? The manufacturers of Enfamil and Similac are both headquartered in the Chicago area. So there is no federal court jurisdiction when Mead Johnson or Abbott are sued in Illinois.\n\nIn December 2021, NEC lawyers for the plaintiffs filed a motion with the Illinois Supreme Court asking that the separate cases be consolidated before a single judge. This procedure is the state court equivalent of an MDL class action.\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Abbott and Mead Johnson were granted extensions of time to respond to this request. Both companies will probably be in favor of consolidation since defending a single action will be more efficient than defending 30 separate cases at once.\n\nIllinois May Be NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit Epicenter\n\nThe creation of a state court MDL for NEC baby formula lawsuits in Illinois would indicate the rapidly growing momentum behind these cases. As more NEC infant formula lawsuits get filed in 2022, our attorneys expect a new infant formula MDL class action in federal court.\n\nBut maybe not. Illinois law is more advantageous to victims than most states. Illinois liberally allows lawyers from other jurisdictions to be admitted to work on lawsuits in that state. Mead and Abbott are both based in Illinois. So they cannot object to answering an NEC lawsuit in that jurisdiction. It may be that a large number of NEC baby formula lawsuits are filed in Illinois, even if they originated in Florida, Texas or any other state.\n\nIf this (mini) NEC baby formula class action lawsuit takes off, it will be an important development because it will push these lawsuits involving these milk fortifiers forward. This may force these companies to offer fair settlement amounts to resolve NEC-related injuries and deaths.\n\nWhat Is the Statute of Limitations for an NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit?\n\nThe statute of limitations to file an NEC lawsuit is a complicated question. The deadline to sue depends on the state where the harm occurred. There are often different statutes of limitations for the child \u2013 who might have a 21-year deadline to file \u2013 and the parents, who usually have a shorter deadline to file suit.\n\nAn NEC Lawsuit May Have Discovery Rule Statute of Limitations Extension\n\nThere is also arguably a discovery rule issue in the NEC lawsuits that could extend the statute of limitations even further. NEC lawsuits have alleged that because of misleading marketing and lack of adequate warnings of the risks of cow milk, parents did not know and could not have known of the link between NEC and baby formula from cow milk until just recently.\n\nBut there could be a short window to file a claim. So if you think you might want to bring a baby formula lawsuit, call an NEC formula lawyer today to fully understand your rights even if you do not have a present intention of filing an NEC lawsuit.\n\nSimilac vs. Enfamil: Is One Worse Than the Other?\n\nSimilac and Enfamil are the two leading brands of infant formula. When it comes to causing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature babies, it appears both Enfamil and Similac are equally bad. (The Similac recall from bad baby formula coming out of Michigan was not specific to NEC.)\n\nWhile future research may shed more light on whether Similac or Enfamil poses a greater threat, the consensus among healthcare professionals and legal experts remains clear: the primary risk factor for NEC in preemies is the use of cow\u2019s milk-based formulas, regardless of the brand.\n\nHow Will Mead\u2019s and Abbott\u2019s Lawyers Defend NEC Lawsuits?\n\nFirst, the defense attorneys will argue preemption. The gist of this argument is that premature infant formula claims under state law are not permitted by the Infant Formula Act (\u201cIFA\u201d) 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 350a. This is not a winning argument, and it has never been successfully made.\n\nIn a medical malpractice case involving NEC in 2021, one defense expert made this argument which I think you can expect to see from Mead and Abbott:\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim that any provider \u2018caused\u2019 NEC is not supported by the literature. The cause of NEC is not understood at this time. Because there is no medically accepted single factor that causes NEC, no one can state within a reasonable degree of medical certainty what causes NEC.\n\nIn particular, it is impossible to know what caused the infant plaintiff to develop NEC. Even among exclusively human mild-feeding preterm infants, NEC can occur. The fact is NEC can neither be predicted nor prevented.\n\nThe main defense against developing NEC is avoiding preterm delivery; however, in this case, the pregnancy could not be extended because [the baby\u2019s mother] experienced a premature preterm rupture of membranes before she arrived at [the hospital.]\n\nFurther, the claim that the specific cause of NEC can be identified is rank speculation. Although NEC occurs most frequently in preterm infants, it occurs in term infants\n\nThis argument flies in the face of mountains of medical literature. I think the defense attorneys\u2019 arguments are so flawed in these cases I suspect the defendants will offer reasonable settlement amounts before any NEC lawsuit makes it to trial.\n\nHow Does NEC Cause Damage to the Intestine?\n\nNEC can cause severe damage to the intestine due to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply. Normally, the ductus arteriosus\u2014a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and aorta\u2014closes shortly after birth, redirecting blood flow so that the infant\u2019s organs, including the intestines, receive adequate oxygenated blood.\n\nWith children with NEC, the ductus arteriosus can remain open. This can cause a condition called Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). What happens is the failure to close causes critically need oxygenated blood to bypass critical organs like the intestines and return to the lungs. This misdirection can lead to pulmonary edema and a significant reduction in oxygenated blood supply to the intestines.\n\nOxygen deprivation of any kind causes having for newborns. In this situation, it in the intestines damages the lining of the bowel wall, making it more susceptible to bacterial infection and erosion. This problem is exacerbated in premature and low birth weight infants, who are often already in a tough spot with underdeveloped and vulnerable intestines.\n\nWhen these infants are fed cow\u2019s milk-based formula, the condition worsens rapidly, as the formula is not well-tolerated by their fragile systems. Both Similac and Enfamil products are derived, as we have been saying from cow\u2019s milk, which is not easily digested by the immature digestive systems of premature babies. The compromised intestinal lining becomes inflamed and, in severe cases, may develop perforations, allowing bacteria and stool to leak into the abdomen. This can cause life-threatening sepsis, a severe infection that can quickly lead to permanent injury or death.\n\nOne of the downside risks to the child is a condition known as short bowel syndrome. With this condition, the infant has reduced ability to absorb nutrients due to the loss of large portions of the intestine. Long-term complications can include chronic digestive issues, malnutrition, and neurological impairments.\n\nCall Our Lawyers About Your NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit\n\nOur law firm is currently investigating potential NEC toxic baby formula lawsuits.

Last year, Sanlam increased its stakes in both firms beyond 50%, by purchasing shares from TPG India Investments and Shriram Ownership Trust.\n\nAlso read | Piramal Group sharpens focus on AI, ML, analytics for digital efficiency\n\n\"Piramal Enterprises is consolidating its financial services business by merging with its housing finance arm Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd, and rebranding the merged entity as Piramal Finance Ltd, simplifying the group structure and providing shareholders with direct access to the entire lending business. This strategic move is also aimed at eliminating cost duplication, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving customer experience,\" said the second person.\n\nThe two persons said through this consolidation, the group plans to capitalize on the country's thriving affordable housing business.\n\nIn May 2024, Piramal Alternatives Trust, the fund management division of the Piramal Group, announced an investment of \u20b9600 crore in a microfinance NBFC Annapurna Finance Pvt. Ltd.\n\n\"The exit from Shriram is a part of PEL's plan to sell non-core assets. The sale proceeds will strengthen its balance sheet and provide funds for future growth opportunities,\" said this person.\n\nAlso read | EV financing no longer risky, says Shriram Finance's executive vice chairman Umesh Revankar\n\nApart from the focus on lending, there is another reason as well.\n\nThe promoter of an insurance company with a 50% stake can hold only up to 10% stake in another insurance company, only under special conditions or with regulatory exemption. Piramal already holds 50% in Pramerica Life Insurance Ltd, and more than 10% in the Shriram ventures.\n\nSelling stake in the life insurance firm will bring the group in line with regulatory norms, while the general insurance stake sale is purely a part of the strategy to sell off non-core assets and use the funds for investment in the lending business, the second person added.\n\nPiramal sold its pharmaceuticals business to Abbott for about \u20b917,000 crore in 2010 and invested part of the amount in key Shriram group firms. It bought 9.96% stake in Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd in May 2013 from the open market for \u20b91,636 crore. Then in 2014, Piramal Enterprises had acquired an effective 20% equity stake in Shriram Capital Ltd for \u20b92,014 crore.\n\nIn 2019 PEL sold its entire stake in asset financing firm Shriram Transport Finance Co. for \u20b92,305 crore. In June 2024, Piramal sold its 8.3% stake in Shriram Finance for \u20b94,824 crore in the open market.\n\nIn parallel, the Pirmal group is restructuring its core business.\n\nAlso read | In our sector, trust and credentials are key: Shriram Finance\u2019s Venkatraman\n\nIn May, listed Piramal Enterprises decided to merge with unlisted PCHFL, which would spare the latter from the requirement of a public share sale under the central bank's rules for so-called upper-layer NBFCs. Selling off the insurance business stake will improve Piramal Enterprises' balance sheet before the merger, the second person added.",

            "content": "Cytokinetics, Incorporated ( ) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 8.5% to US$46.00 in the week after its latest full-year results. Revenues came in 29% better than analyst models expected, at US$18mwhile statutory losses per share were US$5.26, in line with forecasts. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Cytokinetics' 17 analysts is for revenues of US$32.3m in 2025. This would reflect a huge 75% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share losses are supposed to see a sharp uptick, reaching US$5.74. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$47.8m and US$5.33 per share in losses. There's been a definite change in sentiment in this update, with the analysts administering a notable cut to next year's revenue estimates, while at the same time increasing their loss per share forecasts.\n\nThe average price target was broadly unchanged at US$79.10, perhaps implicitly signalling that the weaker earnings outlook is not expected to have a long-term impact on the valuation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Cytokinetics analyst has a price target of US$120 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$60.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and growth estimates. For example, we noticed that Cytokinetics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 75% growth to the end of 2025 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 12% a year over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 20% per year. So it looks like Cytokinetics is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts increased their loss per share estimates for next year. They also downgraded Cytokinetics' revenue estimates, but industry data suggests that it is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$79.10, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Cytokinetics going out to 2027, and you can\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to take into consideration.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "Shareholders might have noticed that LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. ( ) filed its yearly result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.7% to US$91.85 in the past week. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$220m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.93 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that LeMaitre Vascular is executing in line with expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for LeMaitre Vascular from eleven analysts is for revenues of US$239.3m in 2025. If met, it would imply a solid 8.8% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to climb 14% to US$2.24. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$240.2m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.17 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\n\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 6.6% to US$105. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values LeMaitre Vascular at US$120 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$90.00. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that LeMaitre Vascular is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that LeMaitre Vascular's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 8.8% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 13% over the past five years. Compare this to the 239 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while LeMaitre Vascular's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around LeMaitre Vascular's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Despite a promising Friday, the week\u2019s echo rang of uncertainty and economic apprehension. Investors found themselves gripping the rails as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq struggled to escape red territory, knocked off balance by a geopolitical storm brewed in the Oval Office.\n\nAmidst whispers of new tariffs and a cautious eye on labor market data, Wall Street swirled in a tempest of anticipation. The drama began with tensions over trade policies and the looming shadows of tariffs, leaving investors clutching at what clarity they could find. The Dow, resilient as ever, saw gains fueled by the robust performance of industry giants like Travelers and Sherwin-Williams, crafting a story of contrasts within the market landscape.\n\nIn the dim corridors of uncertainty, a glimmer emanated from Home Depot, buoyed by falling Treasury yields. The construction giant, navigating the ebb and flow of borrowing costs, stands as a sentinel of the housing market\u2019s potential, enticing buyers in an era of favorable mortgage rates.\n\nThe week\u2019s climax unraveled around the dual narratives of Nvidia and Salesforce. Each company faced the market\u2019s harsh interrogation with quarterly presentations that revealed strength yet couldn\u2019t escape broader market skepticism. Nvidia, intertwined with international currents due to its AI chip ventures, reported robust results, though they fell shy of investor expectations accustomed to blockbuster surprises. Meanwhile, Salesforce navigated imperfections deftly, sustaining belief in its AI fervor.\n\nYet, investors tread cautiously, trimming holdings in the likes of Abbott Laboratories and Starbucks, a strategic retreat amidst the volatility. Meanwhile, fresh players, like Texas Roadhouse, caught the market\u2019s eye as promising contenders.\n\nAs the calendar page turns, Wall Street braces for crucial employment data set to drop, casting another spotlight on the tapestry of the U.S. economy. Traders whisper of the Federal Reserve and its watchful eye, aware that each economic ripple could influence the steady hand that guides interest rates. The saga of tariffs continues to unravel, with international relations and economic policies painting the unpredictable horizon ahead.\n\nIn this volatile landscape, one truth emerges clear: the delicate dance of market forces never ceases, urging both caution and bold steps upon the tightrope of global finance.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride: Key Insights and Strategies for Navigating Market Volatility\n\nMarket Conditions and Economic Signals\n\n1. Analysis of Geopolitical Tensions: The past week\u2019s market volatility was significantly influenced by geopolitical tensions emanating from the Oval Office. The concerns over new tariffs have sparked apprehension, as such measures can lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers alike, ultimately affecting global trade dynamics. To fully appreciate this, investors should keep an eye on international negotiations and economic announcements from the White House.\n\n2. Impact of Labor Market Data: Labor market data is crucial for predicting economic health. Analysts often look for signals like job growth rates and unemployment figures to gauge economic strength. Unexpected results in employment data can lead to sharp reactions in the market, influencing Fed policy decisions on interest rates.\n\nIndustry Highlights and Performance\n\n3. Standout Stock Performances:\n\n\u2013 Home Depot: Benefiting from falling Treasury yields, Home Depot remains a beacon in the housing sector. Lower borrowing costs make mortgages more attractive, potentially boosting home improvement sales. Investors should monitor interest rates and housing market health to evaluate Home Depot\u2019s future performance.\n\n\u2013 Nvidia and Salesforce: While both companies posted strong quarterly results, market expectations were even higher. Nvidia\u2019s focus on AI chips ties it closely to global tech trends and regulatory considerations. Salesforce\u2019s adaptability in AI integration showcases its potential, but competition remains intense.\n\n4. New Market Entrants:\n\n\u2013 Texas Roadhouse: As a fresh player on Wall Street\u2019s radar, Texas Roadhouse has garnered attention for its growth potential in the casual dining sector. Investors interested in consumer trends should follow its quarterly performance and expansion strategies.\n\nMarket Strategies and Recommendations\n\n5. Portfolio Diversification: In times of market uncertainty, diversification is key. Investors are advised to balance their portfolios with a mix of growth and value stocks, maintaining exposure to different sectors to mitigate risk.\n\n6. Monitoring Federal Reserve Announcements: The Federal Reserve\u2019s stance on interest rates is a pivotal driver of market sentiment. Keeping abreast of Fed meetings and policy shifts can provide critical insights for strategic financial decisions.\n\n7. Investing in Stability: Companies with solid fundamentals and a strong track record, like Travelers and Sherwin-Williams, often provide stability during turbulent times. These stocks could form the cornerstone of a balanced investment portfolio.\n\nPredictions and Future Trends\n\n8. AI and Technological Advancements: As companies like Nvidia and Salesforce push the boundaries in AI, expect continued investments and innovations in this field. Investors should look for opportunities in related tech sectors that could capitalize on these advancements.\n\n9. The Future of Tariffs: Ongoing trade negotiations will continue to shape market dynamics. Close observation of international diplomacy and trade agreements will be essential for investors to understand potential impacts on global supply chains and market conditions.\n\nConclusion: Immediate Actions for Investors\n\n\u2013 Stay Informed: Regularly check reliable financial news sources to stay updated on economic indicators and geopolitical developments.\n\n\u2013 Assess Risk Appetite: Given the current climate, consider whether your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.\n\n\u2013 Consider Safe Havens: In uncertain times, investing in stable assets such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks may offer a buffer against volatility.\n\nFor more financial news and updates, visit CNBC or Wall Street Journal.",

Bacteria can then leak out from the holes and into the abdomen, which can cause severe infections and can even be fatal.\n\n\u201cThe only consistent observations made in infants who develop NEC are the presence of prematurity and formula feeding.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles\n\nNEC often develops within the first 2 weeks of life in a premature infant who is being fed with formula as opposed to breast milk.\n\nIn some cases of NEC, these feedings have occurred while the premature baby is still in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), leaving parents confused as to what may have caused their child's condition.\n\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis Complications\n\nSadly, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition that can often be fatal. The mortality rate for babies who develop NEC is estimated to be around 40%, making it the leading cause of overall infant mortality in the U.S., according to the NEC Society.\n\nAbout 50% of the infants who survive NEC will develop long-term health complications, according to the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD).\n\nSome of these health issues include:\n\nBrain injuries (like cerebral palsy or bleeding in the brain)\n\nHIE (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, a disorder that occurs when the brain doesn\u2019t receive enough oxygen for extended periods)\n\nSepsis\n\nShort bowel syndrome\n\nThe cost of treating NEC and the health complications it may cause can often be too much for many families \u2014 but you may be able to take legal action that could hold the formula manufacturer accountable and recover compensation for your child\u2019s treatment.\n\nIf your child suffered from any of these NEC health complications after being fed cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula, contact Sokolove Law today.\n\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Symptoms in Infants\n\nBecause of the high mortality rate for babies with NEC, it is very important to watch out for the signs of NEC and act quickly if you recognize them.\n\nSigns and symptoms of NEC in babies may include:\n\nBloating or swelling of the belly (abdominal distention)\n\nBloody stool\n\nDecreased activity (lethargy)\n\nGreenish-colored fluid (bile) in the stomach\n\nPoor tolerance of feeding (not being able to digest food)\n\nTemperature instability\n\nIf your infant is showing any of these NEC symptoms, consult a physician immediately.\n\nGet Help Pursuing Justice and Compensation for Your Child\n\nIf your child developed NEC after being fed Enfamil, Similac, or other cow\u2019s milk-based infant formulas, you may be able to take legal action on their behalf \u2014 and we may be able to help.\n\nAs a national product liability law firm, Sokolove Law has over 45 years of experience helping injured clients and their families pursue the justice and compensation they deserve.\n\nIn this time, we\u2019ve managed to secure over $9.8 Billion for thousands of families all across the country.\n\nGet a free case review or call (800) 995-1212 today to learn more about your legal options and how we may be able to help.

            "content": "Abbott Laboratories ( ) announced strong profits, but the stock was stagnant. We did some digging, and we found some concerning factors in the details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Unusual Tax Situation\n\nAbbott Laboratories reported a tax benefit of US$6.4b, which is well worth noting. This is meaningful because companies usually pay tax rather than receive tax benefits. We're sure the company was pleased with its tax benefit. However, our data indicates that tax benefits can temporarily boost statutory profit in the year it is booked, but subsequently profit may fall back. In the likely event the tax benefit is not repeated, we'd expect to see its statutory profit levels drop, at least in the absence of strong growth. While we think it's good that the company has booked a tax benefit, it does mean that there's every chance the statutory profit will come in a lot higher than it would be if the income was adjusted for one-off factors.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Abbott Laboratories' Profit Performance\n\nIn its most recent report, Abbott Laboratories disclosed a tax benefit, as we discussed above. Tax is usually an expense, not a benefit, so we don't think the reported profit number is a particularly good guide to the earning potential of the business.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Abbott Laboratories.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nNYSE:ABT Ownership Breakdown February 28th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Abbott Laboratories?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAbbott Laboratories already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Abbott Laboratories, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:ABT Earnings and Revenue Growth February 28th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Abbott Laboratories is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.9% and 7.2% of the stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Abbott (ABT).\n\nAbbott currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.56, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.56 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68% and 8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ABT\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ABT\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Abbott here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Abbott, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 1.59% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.45%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 2.78%.\n\nShares of the maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs witnessed a gain of 6.34% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Medical sector with its gain of 1.73% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.23%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Abbott will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Abbott is projected to report earnings of $1.07 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9.18%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $10.39 billion, up 4.28% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $5.15 per share and revenue of $44.35 billion, indicating changes of +10.28% and +5.73%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Abbott. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, Abbott is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Abbott is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.43. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.\n\nIt's also important to note that ABT currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.54. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The average PEG ratio for the Medical - Products industry stood at 2.07 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Medical - Products industry is part of the Medical sector.

Additionally, the growing number of elderly people, who are more prone to these conditions, and the growing demand for minimally invasive operations (MI) are driving the market's expansion. In hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities, these catheters are also frequently used for electrophysiology procedures, which involve inserting wire electrodes into catheters to assess electrical activity in the blood arteries that supply the heart.\n\nOther technical developments are also contributing to increase, such as the use of robot-assisted surgical procedures. Accordingly, the production of antimicrobial catheters with silver ion coatings is promoting market expansion by reducing the frequency of thrombosis and catheter-associated illnesses. It is projected that the market will develop due to additional variables, such as the general public's increasing ability to pay for medical operations and the notable advancements in the healthcare system.\n\n\n\nGrowth in chronic diseases\n\n\n\nThe market for catheters is expected to increase significantly due to the rising incidence of chronic illnesses such diabetes, renal problems, and cardiovascular diseases. In order to diagnose, treat, and manage these disorders, catheter-based therapies are frequently necessary. For example, people with diabetes may need dialysis catheters for kidney-related disorders, while patients with cardiovascular problems may need catheterization for angioplasty.\n\nTechnological Advancement\n\n\n\nThe market for catheters is expanding due in large part to technological developments. Catheters are now safer, more comfortable, and more effective because to innovations like the creation of sophisticated materials, coatings, and biocompatible surfaces. These enhancements enhance patient outcomes and lower the chance of problems like infections. Furthermore, the use of catheters in diagnosis and treatment has increased because to the incorporation of smart technology like wireless monitoring and pressure sensors. Demand in the market is being driven by the growing use of minimally invasive catheter designs, which provide easier insertion and faster recovery in a variety of medical operations.\n\n\n\nGrowing Investment in Healthcare\n\n\n\nAn important factor propelling the catheter market's expansion is the rise in healthcare expenditures. More financing is enhancing healthcare infrastructure, increasing access to cutting-edge medical technologies, and promoting the uptake of novel medical equipment, such as catheters, in both established and emerging nations.\n\nModern healthcare facilities, diagnostic tools, and minimally invasive procedures - all of which depend on catheter-based interventions - are receiving top priority investments from governments, commercial institutions, and healthcare organizations. This increase in healthcare spending is especially noticeable in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, where rising healthcare knowledge and access are driving up demand for different kinds of catheters and propelling market expansion.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Catheter Market\n\nHigh Costs\n\n\n\nThe market for catheters is severely hampered by high prices, especially for sophisticated catheter technology utilized in specialist treatments. Expensive research and development, materials, and manufacturing all add to the final cost. Accessibility may be hampered by this, particularly in low- and middle-income nations where healthcare spending is limited. Consequently, cost-effectiveness and affordability emerge as major obstacles to the broad use of certain catheter technologies.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Hurdles\n\n\n\nIn the catheter industry, regulatory obstacles are a major problem because different regions have different strict criteria for product approval and safety regulations. Time-to-market may be delayed by the complicated standards that manufacturers must follow, which include stringent testing, clinical trials, and documentation. Particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, these drawn-out approval procedures raise expenses and impede innovation. Additionally, shifting laws and disparate standards across markets may add to the complexity, restricting access to and growth in international markets.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nBecton Dickinson and Company\n\nBoston Scientific Corporation\n\nTeleflex Incorporated\n\nMedtronic Plc.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nEdwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nStryker Corporation\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 250 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $25.32 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $51.65 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.2% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Health-care and medical device companies should start preparing for operational and regulatory changes stemming from the US Supreme Court ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo finding courts no longer have to defer to federal agencies\u2019 own interpretations of laws and statutes.\n\nMedical companies also should prepare for the implementation and ongoing refinement of global tax regulations affecting intercompany transactions. There are several emerging trends and challenges to consider.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny and compliance. Growth in the medical device industry has led multinational enterprises to consolidate and invest heavily in advanced technologies. But the pursuit of innovation is fraught with challenges, particularly when navigating disputes with the IRS over the valuation of intangible property.\n\nAbbott Laboratories, for example, petitioned the US Tax Court to contest nearly $417 million in assessed deficiencies for the 2019 tax year, challenging the IRS\u2019s adjustments to its royalty income and the inclusion of stock-based compensation in its cost-sharing arrangements.\n\nThe ongoing litigation involving Medtronic highlights further complexities, as the IRS challenged Medtronic US\u2019 licensing of intangible property to its Puerto Rican subsidiary. In Amgen Inc. v. Commissioner, the IRS challenged Amgen\u2019s claim to a share of the profits from biologic drug sales.\n\nTax authorities\u2019 heightened scrutiny of intercompany charges related to licensing intangible property particularly affects health-care and medical device companies due to their diverse portfolios, which include device design, manufacturing processes, software algorithms, and branding. Determining a definitive price for intangible assets poses significant challenges because of the inherent subjectivity of their valuation.\n\nThis complexity is exacerbated when tax authorities have broad discretion to interpret statutes, allowing them to construct arguments that align with their positions. Consequently, companies are left vulnerable to challenges to their pricing methodologies.\n\nGlobal competition and cost pressures. International trade shapes manufacturing practices and transfer pricing compliance for the medical device industry. With US exports representing one-quarter of domestic manufacturers\u2019 revenue, and imports fulfilling over one-third of domestic demand, companies are operating in a competitive global market.\n\nPotential tariffs from the Trump administration could disrupt global supply chains. Manufacturers in countries with lower production costs, such as Mexico, can offer more affordable prices, challenging traditional players such as German manufacturers. But tariffs may change the game for such manufacturers. Either way, the competitive landscape pressures companies to optimize their cost structures while complicating transfer pricing strategies.\n\nJudicial changes and tax compliance. The Supreme Court\u2019s Loper Bright decision represents a significant shift in how courts interpret agency regulations, including those issued by the IRS concerning tax compliance. By overruling the Chevron doctrine, courts can exercise independent judgment in assessing whether agencies have acted within their statutory authority.\n\nThis change could have profound implications for pricing strategies for intangible property of health-care and medical device sectors companies. With courts now positioned to challenge IRS regulations more rigorously, multinationals facing IRS scrutiny may find greater opportunities to contest IRS tax positions.\n\nOECD BEPS initiatives. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project aims to standardize transfer pricing rules globally. But while it seeks to create a fairer tax environment, it also introduces complexities for multinationals as they navigate diverse regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.\n\nTax professionals must stay informed about these developments to help their clients comply and develop optimal transfer pricing strategies by keeping track of tax authority releases and alerts from service providers.\n\nKey Priorities\n\nTax professionals working with clients in the health-care and medical device sectors should prioritize several strategies to address emerging trends and challenges in transfer pricing.\n\nEmploy widely accepted valuation methodologies. Use income, market, and cost approaches to establish a consistent basis for valuations, ensuring defensibility in pricing practices.\n\nConsider advance pricing agreements. Entering into such agreements with tax authorities help gain certainty over transfer pricing practices, which can diminish the risk of disputes and enhance compliance.\n\nConduct regular internal audits. Perform audits and reviews of valuations and transfer pricing practices regularly to identify potential issues early and stay current with tax regulations. Doing so can prevent minor discrepancies from escalating into significant disputes and reinforce compliance.\n\nEstablish thorough and robust documentation practices. Develop record-keeping that captures all relevant data related to intangible asset development. This includes research and development expenses, market studies, and comparable transactions. Emphasize the importance of conducting regular valuations and ensuring royalty agreements are justifiable. The use of corroborative analyses may help if audited.\n\nEngage with policymakers and tax authorities. Actively advocate for clearer guidelines and standards related to intellectual property valuation and transfer pricing.\n\nBy prioritizing robust risk management strategies and adapting to the changing landscape of international trade, multinationals can better position themselves to mitigate transfer pricing disputes and thrive in a competitive market.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nVernon Noronha is director at Moss Adams with expertise in transfer pricing services across a range of industries.\n\nFelicita Moreno-Stevens is a senior associate at Moss Adams with focus on transfer pricing implications and strategies related to IP valuation and relevant tax laws and regulations.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines",

(Nasdaq: PSTV) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics with advanced platform technologies for central nervous system (CNS) cancers, today announced that is has appointed Mr. Russell Bradley as the President and General Manager of its wholly-owned subsidiary, CNSide Diagnostics, LLC (\u201cCNSide\u201d). Furthermore, Plus has also appointed Dr. Marc Hedrick, Mr. Rick Hawkins, and Mr. Russell Bradley to the CNSide Board of Directors, and Dr. Jonathan Stein has been named CNSide Medical Director.\n\n\"On behalf of Plus and the CNSide board of directors, I am extremely pleased to welcome Russ Bradley to lead CNSide Diagnostics,\" said Marc H. Hedrick, Plus Therapeutics President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Russ is a seasoned and experienced operator across the diagnostic landscape and will make an immediate impact on CNSide as we begin a pilot market introduction this quarter.\u201d\n\nRuss Bradley brings over 30 years of leadership experience in diagnostics and life sciences, having held senior executive roles at Abbott Laboratories, Luminex Corporation, and Beckman Coulter. Throughout his career, he has successfully launched and scaled market-leading diagnostic platforms, developed global growth strategies, and led business transformations.\n\n\"In recent months, through conversations with leading neuro-oncologists and the teams at Plus Therapeutics and CNSide Diagnostics, the urgent need for improved tools to test for and treat leptomeningeal disease has become abundantly clear,\" said Mr. Bradley. \"I am excited to take on this role and build upon the substantial progress achieved by the team over the last nine months. Our immediate priority is to fully capitalize CNSide Diagnostics to support our early access and initial launch plans in the U.S.\u201d\n\nDr. Jonathan Stein, CNSide\u2019s new Medical Director, is a clinical laboratory executive with over 20 years of expertise in molecular diagnostics, assay development, and regulatory compliance. He has led multiple labs as Chief Science Officer and Medical Director, advancing oncology testing. Previously, he served as Medical Director at Gene By Gene and as a Research Investigator at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nAbout Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)\n\nLM is a rare complication of cancer in which the primary cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. All malignancies originating from solid tumors, primary brain tumors, or hematological malignancies have this LM complication potential with breast cancer as the most common cancer linked to LM, with 3 -5% of breast cancer patients developing LM. Additionally, lung cancer, GI cancers and melanoma can also spread to the CSF and result in LM. LM occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is usually terminal with 1-year and 2-year survival of just 7% and 3% , respectively. The incidence of LM is on the rise, partly because cancer patients are living longer and partly because many standard chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells, yet there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for LM patients, who often succumb to this complication within weeks to several months, if untreated.\n\nAbout CNSide Diagnostic, LLC\n\nCNSide Diagnostics, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plus Therapeutics, Inc. that develops and commercializes proprietary laboratory-developed tests, such as CNSide, designed to identify tumor cells that have metastasized to the central nervous system in patients with carcinomas and melanomas. The CNSide\u2122 LDT Platform enables quantitative analysis and molecular characterization of tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid that inform and improve the management of patients with leptomeningeal metastases. The Company is planning to commercialize CNSide in the U.S. in 2025.\n\nAbout CNSide Test\n\nThe CNSide Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Platform consists of four laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used for treatment selection and treatment monitoring of patients with Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM) from carcinomas or melanoma. The CNSide platform facilitates tumor cell detection/enumeration and biomarker identification using cellular assays (immunocytochemistry (ICC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) and molecular assays (next-generation sequencing (NGS)). The CNSide CSF tumor cell enumeration LDT is currently being used in the ReSPECT-LM trial as an exploratory endpoint and will be commercially available in 2025. The product is intended \u201cFor Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.\u201d RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use.\n\nAbout Plus Therapeutics\n\nPlus Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for difficult-to-treat cancers of the central nervous system with the potential to enhance clinical outcomes for patients. Combining image-guided local beta radiation and targeted drug delivery approaches, the Company is advancing a pipeline of product candidates with lead programs in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). The Company has built a supply chain through strategic partnerships that enable the development, manufacturing and future potential commercialization of its products. Plus Therapeutics is led by an experienced and dedicated leadership team and has operations in key cancer clinical development hubs, including Austin and San Antonio, Texas.

(Nasdaq: PSTV) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics with advanced platform technologies for central nervous system (CNS) cancers, today announced that is has appointed Mr. Russell Bradley as the President and General Manager of its wholly-owned subsidiary, CNSide Diagnostics, LLC (\u201cCNSide\u201d). Furthermore, Plus has also appointed Dr. Marc Hedrick, Mr. Rick Hawkins, and Mr. Russell Bradley to the CNSide Board of Directors, and Dr. Jonathan Stein has been named CNSide Medical Director.\n\n\"On behalf of Plus and the CNSide board of directors, I am extremely pleased to welcome Russ Bradley to lead CNSide Diagnostics,\" said Marc H. Hedrick, Plus Therapeutics President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Russ is a seasoned and experienced operator across the diagnostic landscape and will make an immediate impact on CNSide as we begin a pilot market introduction this quarter.\u201d\n\nRuss Bradley brings over 30 years of leadership experience in diagnostics and life sciences, having held senior executive roles at Abbott Laboratories, Luminex Corporation, and Beckman Coulter. Throughout his career, he has successfully launched and scaled market-leading diagnostic platforms, developed global growth strategies, and led business transformations.\n\n\"In recent months, through conversations with leading neuro-oncologists and the teams at Plus Therapeutics and CNSide Diagnostics, the urgent need for improved tools to test for and treat leptomeningeal disease has become abundantly clear,\" said Mr. Bradley. \"I am excited to take on this role and build upon the substantial progress achieved by the team over the last nine months. Our immediate priority is to fully capitalize CNSide Diagnostics to support our early access and initial launch plans in the U.S.\u201d\n\nDr. Jonathan Stein, CNSide\u2019s new Medical Director, is a clinical laboratory executive with over 20 years of expertise in molecular diagnostics, assay development, and regulatory compliance. He has led multiple labs as Chief Science Officer and Medical Director, advancing oncology testing. Previously, he served as Medical Director at Gene By Gene and as a Research Investigator at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nAbout Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)\n\nLM is a rare complication of cancer in which the primary cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. All malignancies originating from solid tumors, primary brain tumors, or hematological malignancies have this LM complication potential with breast cancer as the most common cancer linked to LM, with 3-5% of breast cancer patients developing LM. Additionally, lung cancer, GI cancers and melanoma can also spread to the CSF and result in LM. LM occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is usually terminal with 1-year and 2-year survival of just 7% and 3%, respectively. The incidence of LM is on the rise, partly because cancer patients are living longer and partly because many standard chemotherapies cannot reach sufficient concentrations in the spinal fluid to kill the tumor cells, yet there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for LM patients, who often succumb to this complication within weeks to several months, if untreated.\n\nAbout CNSide Diagnostic, LLC\n\nCNSide Diagnostics, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plus Therapeutics, Inc. that develops and commercializes proprietary laboratory-developed tests, such as CNSide, designed to identify tumor cells that have metastasized to the central nervous system in patients with carcinomas and melanomas. The CNSide\u2122 LDT Platform enables quantitative analysis and molecular characterization of tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid that inform and improve the management of patients with leptomeningeal metastases. The Company is planning to commercialize CNSide in the U.S. in 2025.\n\nAbout CNSide Test\n\nThe CNSide Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Platform consists of four laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used for treatment selection and treatment monitoring of patients with Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM) from carcinomas or melanoma. The CNSide platform facilitates tumor cell detection/enumeration and biomarker identification using cellular assays (immunocytochemistry (ICC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) and molecular assays (next-generation sequencing (NGS)). The CNSide CSF tumor cell enumeration LDT is currently being used in the ReSPECT-LM trial as an exploratory endpoint and will be commercially available in 2025. The product is intended \u201cFor Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.\u201d RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use.\n\nAbout Plus Therapeutics\n\nPlus Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for difficult-to-treat cancers of the central nervous system with the potential to enhance clinical outcomes for patients. Combining image-guided local beta radiation and targeted drug delivery approaches, the Company is advancing a pipeline of product candidates with lead programs in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). The Company has built a supply chain through strategic partnerships that enable the development, manufacturing and future potential commercialization of its products. Plus Therapeutics is led by an experienced and dedicated leadership team and has operations in key cancer clinical development hubs, including Austin and San Antonio, Texas.

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nTo generate years of passive income, you could either build a portfolio of individual dividend stocks or simply invest in a dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF allows you to buy several stocks at a time without the hassle of managing a portfolio. Buying some units of a high-yield dividend ETF, for instance, can fetch you regular dividends from a basket of stocks and earn you a high yield, without your having to research and invest in individual stocks.\n\nIf the concept appeals to you as an income investor, check out these three fantastic high-yield dividend ETFs to buy now. Each of these ETFs yields substantially higher than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) yield of 1.3%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nInvest in top dividend growth stocks with this ETF\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) is undeniably one of the best high-yield dividend ETFs you could buy. That's because it tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index, which doesn't include just high-yielding stocks but focuses on 100 consistent dividend-paying stocks with the financial fortitude to back their steady and often growing dividends.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's top 10 holdings, for example, include Dividend Kings, like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Abbvie (NYSE: ABBV), and top dividend stocks like Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Coca-Cola stock, yielding 2.8%, has paid a dividend for 103 consecutive years and increased it yearly for the past 62 consecutive years. The beverage giant has 30 billion-dollar brands, some of which were acquired over the past decade and have contributed substantially to its free-cash-flow (FCF) growth.\n\nLikewise, the 3.3%-yielding Abbvie stock has increased its dividend payout for 52 consecutive years, including when it was part of Abbott Laboratories. Abbvie's biggest strength is its research and development. For instance, despite losing U.S. patent exclusivity for its top drug, Humira, the pharmaceutical giant foresees high-single-digit revenue growth through 2029, driven by Humira's successors.\n\nChevron is another rock-solid dividend-paying stock. Yielding 4.4%, the oil and gas giant has increased dividends for 37 consecutive years despite the volatility in commodity prices. Chevron is now expanding production and betting big on its $53 billion impending acquisition of Hess (currently embroiled in an arbitration challenge). Even without Hess, Chevron expects to grow its average annual FCF by more than 10%.\n\nThis motley mix of dividend growth stocks has generated massive returns for shareholders of this ETF.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is also one of the most well-diversified ETFs, with double-digit exposures to key sectors like healthcare, financials, consumer staples, energy, and industrials. It yields 3.6% and has an expense ratio of only 0.06%, making it an incredible high-yield dividend ETF to buy and hold.\n\nAn intriguing dividend ETF with a massive yield\n\nGiven the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF's (NYSEMKT: JEPI) hefty yield of 7.3%, you'd expect the ETF to invest only in some of the highest dividend stocks. That, however, is far from the truth, and that's what makes this one such an intriguing dividend ETF.\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF is different from a typical dividend ETF. It invests at least 80% in stocks from the U.S., primarily large caps from the S&P 500 index, and 20% in equity-linked notes (ELNs) that sell call options with exposure to the S&P 500 index.\n\nSo, while the 80% investment in stocks provides a steady flow of dividends, the 20% investment in ELNs reduces volatility and allows the fund to pay monthly dividends from the recurring cash flows received from premiums on the call options. Eventually, for shareholders, buying shares of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF means a steady flow of monthly income plus a high yield. It's a win-win.\n\nInterestingly enough, this ETF owns more than 100 stocks from a variety of sectors and industries, with no special focus on dividends. Its top holdings, for example, include Visa, Mastercard, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Amazon doesn't even pay a dividend, and Meta declared its first dividend in 2024. Visa and Mastercard, on the other hand, are top dividend-paying companies with high operating margins and a strong track record of dividend hikes.\n\nELNs, therefore, are a crucial part of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF's strategy to generate income and offer a high yield. They're also why this ETF may perform better during market volatility. The potential low-volatility monthly dividends and high yield make it an attractive dividend ETF to buy for passive income.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "It took Peter Dutton less than half a day to sign up to $8.5bn in his election plans to match the Labor government\u2019s commitment to redefine Medicare bulk billing.\n\nSuch is the potency of Anthony Albanese\u2019s attack on Dutton\u2019s record as health minister \u2013 the man who thought up a $7 co-payment for GP visits \u2013 and Labor\u2019s campaign to raise fears about what a Coalition government would do to vital public services. Barely 14 hours after the Medicare announcement was published in the media on Saturday night, Dutton said his team would match it \u201cdollar for dollar\u201d.\n\nFour hours before the opposition leader and shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, pledged to meet the government\u2019s announcement to boost free GP visits, the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, was on Sky News, being a little coy about what the Coalition would do and asking Labor \u201cwhere\u2019s the money going to come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will work through that over the next little while,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201cNext little while\u201d turned out to be approximately 240 minutes, before Dutton and Ruston\u2019s price-match promise landed.\n\nDespite Taylor\u2019s concerns about cost, neither Dutton\u2019s press release nor a subsequent press conference revealed where the Coalition would find $8.5bn \u2013 beyond a vague claim that \u201cthe Coalition always manages the economy more effectively and that\u2019s why we can afford to invest into health and education services\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said the government had provisioned $5.4bn of the cost in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook; health minister Mark Butler indicated they could seek to cover further costs through new measures to be announced.\n\nBut surely, if there was ever an area worthy of the government\u2019s balance books dipping further into the red if necessary, it would be addressing concerning trends in bulk billing. The government\u2019s own figures on Sunday conceded less than half of Australians were always bulk billed when seeing a GP in 2023-24, and warned of large discrepancies in rates across Australia; too many people are simply skipping doctor\u2019s visits because they can\u2019t afford rising fees.\n\nIn February, a Cleanbill report found an adult without a concession card would not be able to find a bulk-billing GP in 10% of federal electorates.\n\nIn a wealthy country like Australia, where we pride ourselves on fair access to health services and care, it is shameful and tragic that people are having to check their wallet before deciding whether they can see a doctor for basic services. That\u2019s before we even get to dental services, with teeth and gums treated as though they\u2019re a luxury rather than parts of the body that require healthcare just as much as chests and throats.\n\nIt\u2019s good public policy to support the health of the population, and help people get the care they need, regardless of their bank balance. The government should be applauded for putting an eye-watering $8.5bn to the problem, as should the opposition (despite its otherwise thin policy offering thus far) for backing a good idea when they see one.\n\nBut there\u2019s more than just good policy sense behind the Coalition\u2019s rapid adoption of a plan it initially said it wanted to see more details about.\n\n2:15 'Vastly different agendas': Australian PM Anthony Albanese makes early election pitch \u2013 video\n\nIn a campaign where Dutton currently has built up some momentum, both politically and narratively among many commentators, a protracted argument about Medicare could be the coin on the tracks to derail his train.\n\nBecause Labor is succeeding at making this election all about Medicare, and Dutton\u2019s team can see the danger looming up ahead. Labor is building a case that a Dutton government would be Abbott 2.0, slashing and burning vital services.\n\nIt\u2019s why Labor and the Coalition spent the weekend sending around Canberra their duelling breakdowns of Medicare funding and bulk billing rates during their times in office; it\u2019s why Labor set up a special Facebook page to throw mud at Dutton\u2019s health record, and why the Coalition set up a website of its own called \u2018health facts\u2019 to counter those narratives; and it\u2019s why Dutton, whose campaign so far has been mostly about nickel-and-dime policy offerings and plans to cut spending, suddenly stumped up $8.5bn to match a promise before the prime minister even officially launched it at a campaign rally in Tasmania.\n\nThe potency of a potential argument from Labor, that Dutton was blocking free doctor\u2019s visits if he hadn\u2019t signed up to the pledge, would have been hard to ignore. Dutton called it a \u201cscare campaign\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019ll see a lot of health statistics going around in this campaign.\n\nThe Coalition on Saturday pointed to health data they say showed an 84% bulk-billing rate when Dutton was health minister in 2014, and an 88.5% rate when the Coalition left office in May 2022, compared to a 77.7% rate in December 2024 under Labor.\n\nBut, as Guardian Australia has previously reported, Butler in 2022 claimed those Coalition-era figures were \u201cnot honest\u201d; they were also questioned by consumer groups and health policy experts who said the figures had been artificially inflated.\n\nOn Sunday, Butler further accused the Coalition of \u201ccooking the books\u201d on that data by including millions of Covid-era vaccinations, pathology and telehealth appointments in their sums, which he said Labor wasn\u2019t doing in its projections.\n\nThe government says it has taken time to turn around years of health system neglect, and it needs a bit more time to reverse deteriorating circumstances.\n\nAfter a week where the Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time in years, Labor has succeeded in dragging the argument back to its cost of living and public services wheelhouse, away from the law and order and public safety areas Dutton had managed to make the key issues of recent months.\n\nWhether the government can keep the focus there, is a core question of the next few months of campaign until election day.\n\nBoth sides say they have a good story to tell on health, and have their own cherrypicked statistics to prove they\u2019d do the better job in future. Jim Chalmers presented the election as a choice between Labor \u201cstrengthening\u201d and the Coalition \u201cstrangling\u201d Medicare; Ruston accused Labor of \u201cweakening\u201d the system. Both sides are making the claim that they\u2019d fix the healthcare crisis presided over by the other side.\n\nBut families who simply want to go to the doctor without having to worry about another bill can\u2019t afford for this problem to go on.",

The $4.745bn funding package will support Samsung\u2019s planned $37 billion investment in Texas, which includes the construction of two new chip fabs and an R&D center in the city of Taylor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has routinely criticized the CHIPS and Science Act, saying tariffs, not funding agreements, would be the most effective way of shoring up domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThey already have billions of dollars,\" Trump said to House Republicans during a January speech. \"They\u2019ve got nothing but money, Joe [Biden].

They\u2019re going to build their factory with their own money. We don\u2019t have to give them money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Trump's criticisms also apply to state-level CHIPS Acts, such as the one approved by Governor Abbott in Texas.",

Unfortunately, despite the strong performance over the last month, the full year gain of 7.4% isn't as attractive.\n\nIn spite of the firm bounce in price, given about half the companies in China have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") above 38x, you may still consider Chemclin Diagnostics as an attractive investment with its 23.9x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nFor example, consider that Chemclin Diagnostics' financial performance has been poor lately as its earnings have been in decline. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think the company won't do enough to avoid underperforming the broader market in the near future. However, if this doesn't eventuate then existing shareholders may be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?\n\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nChemclin Diagnostics' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 10% decrease to the company's bottom line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 12% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nComparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 37% growth in the next 12 months, the company's downward momentum based on recent medium-term earnings results is a sobering picture.\n\nWith this information, we are not surprised that Chemclin Diagnostics is trading at a P/E lower than the market. However, we think shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term, which could set up shareholders for future disappointment. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Chemclin Diagnostics' P/E\n\nThe latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Chemclin Diagnostics' P/E close to the market median. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nWe've established that Chemclin Diagnostics maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its sliding earnings over the medium-term, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Chemclin Diagnostics.

Without the use of costly or specialized equipment, lateral flow tests are used to identify the existence of a target component in the liquid sample. The lateral flow assay industry is anticipated to incrrease faster during the forecasted period due to the increased prevalence of infectious diseases. Globally, lateral flow assay applications are considerably growing. Campaigns to educate the people about infectious disease signs and safety techniques are crucial for containing disease epidemics. A significant demand for lateral flow assays is due to greater patient awareness. The development of the lateral flow assay market is also fueled by the approval of new products and rising earnings due to the sales of COVID-19 quick tests. Lateral flow assay (LFA) technology developments have also expanded the market.Adopting new labels, novel signal amplification techniques, improved quantification systems, and simultaneous detection are only a few of the key advances in LFA research that have occurred in recent years. Because of various novel mechanisms, gold colloid nanoparticles have a stronger signal. Colloid nanoparticles made of gold have a stronger signal thanks to several innovative processes. The catalytic amplification of the signal is achieved by combining GNPs with an enzyme (such as horseradish peroxidase) or using silver enhancement technology, which has become more common due to technological improvement. It is anticipated that the tendency will persist during the projected period due to the growing usage of pseudo-imagination and banking. Furthermore, companies like Meta, Google LLC, and Microsoft are anticipated to fuel the development of the generative AI market.List of Prominent Players in the Lateral Flow Assay Market:\u2022 Abbott Laboratories (US),\u2022 Quidel Corporation (US),\u2022 F.

            "content": "Abbott\u2019s ABT diversified business portfolio is well-positioned to drive continued momentum in 2025. Yet, the international business environment continues to be challenging. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nFactors Driving ABT Shares\n\nWithin Abbott\u2019s Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, the company is strategically progressing in biosimilars. Abbott, leveraging on its leading presence in emerging markets, is enjoying a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital-efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to the emerging market population. The first round of commercialization is on track for 2025. The company is highly optimistic about this initiative, considering the fact that biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market.\n\nAbbott continues to expand its Diagnostics business (comprised 23% of the total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024). Over the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing increased global demand for routine diagnostics (excluding COVID-19 testing sales). In the fourth quarter of 2024, rapid diagnostics, excluding COVID-testing sales, increased 16% year over year. Core Laboratory Diagnostics\u2019 growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for Abbott\u2019s immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, in Diabetes Care, sales of CGM exceeded $1.8 billion and grew 23%. For full-year 2024, sales of CGM were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22% from 2023. This included growth of 27% in the United States.\n\nAbbott Laboratories Price\n\nAbbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories Quote\n\nOver the past three months, shares of ABT have gained 11.8% compared with the industry\u2019s 6.2% growth. The company\u2019s consistent efforts to expand in the high-growth areas, as well as its array of new product launches, are expected to help maintain the stock\u2019s uptrend in the coming days.\n\nConcerns Remain for Abbott\n\nForeign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has constantly been hampering the company\u2019s performance in the international markets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on sales.\n\nThe challenging macroeconomic scenario in the form of the ongoing complex geo-political situation globally, specifically where Abbott operates, is driving a higher-than-anticipated increase in expenses in terms of raw materials and freight. These could also result in broader economic impacts and security concerns, affecting the company\u2019s business in the upcoming months. Industrywide, it has been seen that the deteriorating global economic environment is reducing demand for several MedTech products, resulting in lower sales and lower product prices while increasing the cost of goods and operating expenses of the businesses of the MedTech companies.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Abbott incurred an 8.5% increase in the cost of products sold (excluding amortization expense). The gross margin contracted 55 basis points to 55%. Selling, general and administration expenses were up 6.7% year over year, resulting in a 43-basis point contraction in adjusted operating margin.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Veracyte VCYT, ResMed RMD and Omnicell OMCL.\n\nVeracyte, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 65.8% for 2025. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nVCYT\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 520.58%. Veracyte\u2019s shares have risen 49.2% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 5.5% growth.\n\nResMed, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 21.1% for 2025. RMD\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 6.41%. Its shares have risen 34.1% compared with the industry\u2019s 7.7% growth in the past year.\n\nOmnicell, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 72.7% for fourth-quarter 2024. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 121.74%.

KGCochlear LimitedelectroCore, Inc.Inspire Medical Systems, Inc.LivaNova PlcMedtronic PlcMED-ELNevro Corp.Nuvectra CorporationNeuroMetrix, IncOMRON CORPORATIONPIXIUM VISIONSecond Sight Medical Products, Inc.SetPoint MedicalStimwave LLCExpert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Market Dynamics:Drivers-The older population is more susceptible to neurologic or cardiovascular issues. Due to their higher risk of contracting various diseases, geriatric patients comprise a sizeable fraction of the total patient population. The growth of this population group will ensure a long-term and rising need for bioelectric devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardioverter defibrillators, deep brain stimulators, and spinal cord stimulators, to treat cardiovascular and neurological conditions.Significant development opportunities exist for major market players in developing nations, including Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam, Israel, Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. This is due to their lax regulatory requirements, improved healthcare facilities, expanding patient populations, and rising healthcare costs. This has led important companies in the bioelectric medicine market to concentrate on rising nations along with the escalating competition in mature markets.Challenges:One of the main factors limiting market growth is the high cost of bioelectric devices like cochlear implants and neurostimulators, especially in price-sensitive countries like Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In emerging nations, particularly in Mexico and Brazil, healthcare providers typically lack the financial means to invest in advanced technologies. Additionally, the crew needs to receive intensive training in the proper use and upkeep of bioelectric devices.Neurosurgeons who specialize in neural implant procedures and have completed a functional neurosurgery fellowship are required to guide the implantation of bioelectric devices such as neurostimulators in the appropriate body part. There is now a considerable bioelectric shortage of neurologists available worldwide. Given the anticipated rise in healthcare demand due to variables, including the expanding patient population and increasing illness prevalence, this shortfall will be of concern.Regional Trends:In the forecast period, North America dominates the market due to medical device producers like Abbott and Boston Scientific Corporation. With the rising need for cutting-edge medical gadgets for treatment, North America is a leading regional market. Additionally, the region's highly advanced healthcare system and accessibility to cutting-edge items have driven the local market expansion. Large bioelectric medicine producers and highly developed healthcare infrastructure are anticipated to continue to be key market drivers. During the predicted period, the Asia Pacific region is anticipated to increase because of the growing elderly population in Asian nations like China and India. Additionally, chronic disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy are becoming more common in this area, which is anticipated to increase the use of bioelectric.Recent Developments:\u2022 In March 2021, Medtronic plc, a global leader in medical technology, announced that the food and drug administration (FDA) approved modified commercial labeling for the IntellisTM Platform with Differential Target Multiplexed (DTMTM) programming for the chronic disease treatment of persistent back and leg pain. The updated labeling will incorporate study results from a multicenter randomized control trial showing that differential target multiplexed spinal cord stimulation (DTM SCS) provides improved back pain alleviation compared to conventional spinal cord stimulation (SCS).\u2022 In January 2021, Boston Scientific Corporation gained food and drug administration (FDA) approval for its fourth-generation Vercise GenusTM Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System.

One of the primary drivers is the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. These conditions often require specialized nutritional interventions to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and support treatment outcomes. Moreover, an aging population worldwide contributes to expanding the medical nutrition market. Older adults often face nutritional challenges due to age-related changes in metabolism, appetite, and nutrient absorption, necessitating tailored nutritional solutions to maintain their health and quality of life. Furthermore, the rise in lifestyle-related disorders, including obesity and malnutrition, fuels the demand for medical nutrition products and services. As people become more conscious of their dietary habits and seek ways to address nutrition-related health issues, the market for specialized nutrition products, dietary supplements, and clinical nutrition services continues to grow.Challenges:One significant challenge is ensuring the accessibility and affordability of specialized nutritional products, particularly for individuals with chronic conditions or specific dietary needs. Cost barriers can limit access to essential nutritional interventions, impacting patient outcomes and exacerbating health disparities. Regulatory hurdles also present challenges in the medical nutrition market. Stringent regulations govern the development, marketing, and distribution of medical foods and dietary supplements, requiring rigorous scientific evidence to support health claims. Navigating these regulatory frameworks adds complexity and costs to product development and may impede innovation in the field.Moreover, changing consumer preferences and trends pose challenges for companies operating in the medical nutrition sector. While there is growing awareness of the role of nutrition in health and wellness, shifting consumer preferences, such as demand for clean-label products or plant-based alternatives, can disrupt traditional market dynamics. Adapting to evolving consumer preferences while maintaining the efficacy and safety of medical nutrition products presents a balancing act for industry players.Regional Trends:In North America, the medical nutrition industry is characterized by a strong healthcare infrastructure, increased awareness of the role of nutrition in illness treatment, and an aging population. The region experiences a high demand for medical nutrition products adapted to specific dietary needs, notably among those with chronic disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Furthermore, growing healthcare costs and favorable reimbursement regulations drive market expansion in North America. The medical nutrition industry in Asia-Pacific (APAC) is rapidly expanding, driven by factors such as rising disposable incomes, increased urbanization, and a greater emphasis on preventative healthcare. Countries such as China, India, and Japan are seeing an increase in demand for medical nutrition products as the prevalence of lifestyle-related disorders rises and people adopt more nutritious diets. Furthermore, government measures to improve healthcare infrastructure and raise awareness about the significance of nutrition are driving market expansion in the APAC region.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In October 2022, Hologram Sciences and Maeil Health Nutrition forged a strategic partnership to deliver tailored nutrition solutions to the Korean market.\u2022 In April 2022, Glanbia Nutritionals introduced TechVantage, a cutting-edge platform featuring functionally optimized nutrient technology.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.\n\nA survey by Deloitte showed that drug pricing and access are the top concerns among executives in 2025. The survey also showed that the primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. Due to this trend, executives anticipate an increase in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nWe discussed the future of the healthcare industry in the US in a recently published article on the 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth. In addition, pharmacy services, especially those focused on specialty pharmacy, are expected to see continued growth. The launch of new therapies and increased utilization are expected to be the primary drivers of this growth. McKinsey estimates specialty pharmacy revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, growing EBITDA for managed service providers and specialty pharmacies. Therefore, optimistic trends are materializing for the healthcare industry as a whole, including the medical device sector.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 drug stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products.

The company\u2019s cardiovascular devices, which include its structural heart portfolio, are also expected to drive long-term growth as the global population ages.\n\nIn fiscal Q4 2024, the company generated $8.5 billion in operating cash flow, which it used to reinvest in its business by repaying debts, funding capacity expansions, and returning $5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Through Title 42, a public health order implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19, migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border are removed from the country.\n\nThe administration is leaning toward ending Title 42, with the next deadline for renewal in early April. Officials have reportedly raised alarms that dropping Title 42 will result in human trafficking networks throughout Mexico and Central America to \u201cgenerate a mass migration event,\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they were really serious about stopping trafficking, they would secure our borders, rather than create an environment for human trafficking to expand and then react to it after it's already happened,\u201d said former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan to The National Desk\u2019s Jan Jeffcoat. \u201c , that's a drop in the bucket of who's going to break into our country and our southwest border once these restrictions are lifted.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 25,000 migrants are waiting south of the border for Title 42 to end, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Morgan said in terms of housing an influx of migrants, the cost will \u201cfall on the backs of American taxpayers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is much more than the cost of dollars and cents by Americans. This is also Americans paying with their lives with respect to the open borders,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThis is about border security. And when you open your border up to one threat or one crisis \u2014 in this case, illegal immigration \u2014 you're opening your border up to the vast set of complex threats.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott marked the anniversary of a border security initiative, while announcing a new strategy to deter migrants from trying to cross the Rio Grande.\n\n\u201cThis is another ongoing element of Gov. Abbott's Operation Lone Star and another very critical part of this strategy is to do what the Biden administration refuses to do. It really focuses on turnbacks,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cWhat Gov. Abbott\u2019s strategy is going to do is put resources and personnel in key locations to do just that \u2014 to prevent and deter illegal aliens from actually making the way in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has created the Southwest Border Coordination Center to coordinate an interagency response to the influx of\n\n\u201cThis so-called 'war room,' this Coordination Center, it's not to actually do what they should be doing, which is to go to war against the cartels and take back our southern border that they have literally handed over to the cartels. Not at all. What they're doing in this war room, again, is to address the bad political optics because they know that they're going to see a massive increase in illegal immigration,\u201d said Morgan.",

No, the pope is not out of danger,\" Alfieri said, but added: \"If you then ask whether he is in danger of dying at this moment, the answer is still no.\"Francis has said the papacy is a job for life, but has also left the door open to resigning like his predecessor Benedict XVI.He has often joked about the scheming his health woes inevitably prompt, particularly among those who oppose his attempts at reform.After undergoing colon surgery in 2021, he joked that \"they were preparing the conclave\", the meeting of cardinals to elect a new pope following a death or resignation.- A lot of respect -Italian Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi told the Corriere on Friday he did not rule out Francis stepping down.But Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, who leads the Holy See's powerful Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, said he had heard no particular manoeuvring this time.\"I don't see a pre-conclave environment, I don't see more conversations on a potential successor than there were a year ago,\" he told Argentina's La Nacion daily.\"So far I perceive a lot of respect.\"The pope maintains a punishing work schedule, and in September made a 12-day tour to the Asia-Pacific.But he has suffered increasing health issues, from his colon surgery to a hernia operation in 2023. He is also overweight and suffers constant hip and knee pain, which force him to use a wheelchair most of the time.bur-ar/jj",

This is the world\u2019s only leadless pacemaker with a unique mapping capability to assess correct positioning prior to placement and the longest projected battery life. While traditional pacemakers require a chest incision, this device is implanted via a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure through the groin. It marks a significant advancement in patient care, bringing new features to treating physicians,\u201d Venu said. Given that cardiovascular diseases like heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) form a major component of the chronic disease burden in India, this technology is expected to improve patient outcomes.\n\nAccording to Venu, Abbott India is also exploring new treatments for chronic conditions with biosimilars. \u201cThese are medicines similar to original biologics, which are advanced remedies made from living organisms. Biosimilars are usually more affordable, especially for long-term use. In recent years, we\u2019ve launched seven biosimilars in areas like cancer, bone health, and heart care in India,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an email response to Fortune India, Venu said Abbott also continues to drive innovation and provide high-quality products in its established brands. \u201cWith the focus on digital innovation in India, healthcare companies, patients, and healthcare professionals need to collaborate effectively. Abbott is in a unique position to help connect these groups with our diverse portfolio, offering solutions across the continuum of care. Our holistic approach, which encompasses consumer education, diagnosis, innovative treatment pathways, connected care devices, and solutions for medicine adherence, will enable us to serve many patients well into the future,\u201d he said.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Pharmaceuticals Innovation & Development Centre in Mumbai serves as a global hub, supporting over 30 countries with cutting-edge solutions. Its Diabetes Care tech hub manages software and global tech support for its FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system. Its Mumbai-based data science and analytics team drives business intelligence, clinical trial design, and product surveillance for cardiovascular projects globally.\n\nOne of the largest healthcare companies in India, Abbott sells a wide range of products, including medicines, nutrition, medical devices, and diagnostics, in the domestic market.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently offered some important advice on how young people should approach investing and managing their money. He emphasized that the first and most important step for anyone is to invest. Cramer pointed out that investing is the only way to secure financial freedom in the long term. He then stated:\n\n\u201cBefore you can start investing, you need to pay off the foreign credit card\u2026 No matter how much money you rack up in the stock market, if you're carrying a balance on your credit cards, then it's going to eat your returns.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and 17 Best Stocks for Kids According to Jim Cramer\n\nCramer then shared a few lessons specifically tailored for young investors. He explained that the first piece of advice is valuable to people of all ages. His advice was that young people should save money. He noted that the stock market can actually serve as a tool to help people save by forcing them to set aside a portion of their paycheck that they might otherwise spend. He then added:\n\n\u201cSecond lesson for young investors, this is a much more targeted piece of advice: While you're still young, you can afford to take a lot more risks than say a gray beard like myself.\u201d\n\nFinally, Cramer stressed that it is never too early to begin planning for retirement. He recommended taking full advantage of any employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, especially if the employer matches contributions. He also urged young investors to consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which he described as an ideal option for those early in their careers.\n\n\u201cHere's the bottom line: For young people just outta college investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember, when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio and it's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on January 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "content": "Dublin, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Organic Baby Food Market Forecast Report by Type, Distribution Channel, Country and Company 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nOrganic Baby Food market is expected to reach US$ 13.86 billion by 2033 from US$ 5.67 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 10.45 % from 2025 to 2033. Some of the main reasons propelling the market are the rising incidence of different ailments, parents' growing health consciousness, and the expanding sales of high-end organic food varieties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis industry is growing significantly as the demand for organic baby food items, such as cereals and milk formulas, increases. The demand for these goods is expected to increase in the years to come.\n\n\n\nThe market is being driven by marketing and promotion across mainstream distribution channels\n\n\n\nOver the past few years, there has been an upward trend in the market growth for organic baby food items. The market is gradually evolving from a specialized sector to a major industry sector. Product availability varies greatly per nation based on the state of the market. The market for organic infant food products is robust in wealthy nations like Germany, where 70% of sales are made through huge retail chains.\n\nDespite the fact that these products are more expensive than traditional ones, shops provide greater discounts, which encourages customers to purchase them. Since consumers are aware of the products and have been purchasing them for a few years, the expansion of supermarkets and hypermarkets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities is a significant element propelling the market's growth in emerging nations. The market is anticipated to grow in the next years as supermarkets and hypermarkets expand.\n\n\n\nConcerns About the Health of Children Encourage Consumers to Purchase Organic Food Products\n\n\n\nGrowing worries about children's health and the possible dangers of artificial ingredients in food are driving more and more consumers to buy organic baby food. In recent years, parents have been more conscious of the ingredients in their kids' food, avoiding artificial additions, chemicals, and preservatives.\n\nBy giving parents access to information on the advantages of eating organic, chemical-free food, the internet has been instrumental in educating them. Because of this, a lot of parents are now prepared to spend extra money on premium organic baby food, putting their child's health before price. This change is a reflection of a larger social movement that prioritizes infants' health and wellbeing, which raises demand for safe, wholesome, and organic food options.\n\n\n\nGrowing strategic investment in infant food that is organic\n\n\n\nThe market environment has evolved due to consumer preferences for better food options, whether they are natural, organic, or even functionally upgraded. This trend has extended to the infant and toddler nutrition industry. Furthermore, there are more claims for protein, fiber, omega 3, DHA, and no added sugar due to the product portfolios that are easily accessible in store aisles around the globe. The urge to provide newborns with the greatest nutrition available to support healthy growth and development is what drives the demand for both conventional and organic baby food products.\n\nTherefore, the products need to be enhanced with nutrients that promote healthy growth and development as well as naturally occurring breast milk. The Texas-based company Serenity Kids has launched a line of baby food that resembles the paleo diet and boasts the greatest meat and organic vegetable content of any packaged product, despite the growing market interest in the protein composition of baby food. Growing awareness of the nutrient content (package label) and growing concerns about sustainability and organic food ranges are driving the market for fortified organic infant food.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Organic Baby Food Market\n\nHigh Organic Product Costs Will Restrict Market Growth\n\n\n\nIn developing markets, primarily in South Asia and Africa, the uptake of organic food items is somewhat gradual. A limited income group's transient demand is caused by the bulk of customers' ignorance and lack of awareness. This has an additional impact on the industry's growth. The majority of consumers in poor nations are not concerned about safe food.\n\nThe vast majority of emerging nations are price-sensitive and have a wide range of income levels. The cost of organic food is higher than that of regular food items. Unaware of these products, consumers are reluctant to spend that much money on food. For organic products in these nations, the huge price disparity presents difficulties. It is anticipated that this aspect will pose a serious obstacle to the expansion of the industry in developing nations.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Intense Competition\n\n\n\nPrice sensitivity, especially in developing countries, exacerbates the fierce competition in the organic infant food market. Many customers in these nations, where there are notable wealth gaps, place a higher value on affordability than making health-conscious decisions. Because organic baby food is usually more expensive than conventional options, low-income families might not be able to afford it.\n\nFurthermore, demand is further constrained by a lack of knowledge on the long-term advantages of organic food, especially among consumers who are cost-conscious. Despite the perception that organic products are healthier, many consumers in underdeveloped areas are unaware of the benefits of selecting organic over conventional options. Because of this, organic baby food makers have a hard time persuading a significant segment of the market to switch, especially in places where price is a major deciding factor.\n\n\n\nThe market share of prepared baby food was the largest in the organic baby food sector\n\n\n\nThe Prepared Baby Food market has significantly dominated the Organic Baby Food industry. With an increasing emphasis on infant health and nutrition, parents are gravitating towards organic options, driving market share. Organic baby food is considered a safer and healthier choice, free from pesticides and additives.\n\nThe shift in consumer preferences aligns with a broader trend of conscious parenting and a desire for natural, wholesome nutrition. As a result, the Prepared Baby Food market, particularly in the organic segment, continues to expand, catering to parents seeking high-quality, nutritious options for their infants.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets and hypermarkets are key distribution channels for organic baby food\n\n\n\nSupermarkets and Hypermarkets are pivotal in the Organic Baby Food Industry, serving as key distribution channels. These retail giants offer many organic baby food products, providing parents with convenient access to nutritious and wholesome options for their infants. The organized layout, competitive pricing, and diverse product offerings make Supermarkets and Hypermarkets preferred destinations for parents seeking organic choices. This market dynamic enhances the visibility and availability of organic baby food and aligns with the increasing consumer demand for healthier, sustainably sourced products within the expansive grocery retail landscape.\n\nCompany Insights: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nKraft Heinz\n\nNestle S.A.\n\nDanone SA\n\nKewpie Corporation\n\nHero group\n\nArla Foods amba\n\nAAK AB\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 170 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $5.67 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $13.86 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 10.4% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Most companies don't survive for decades, much less pay regular dividends for that long. However, some rare corporations can pull it off. These are the kinds of stocks long-term investors will often be interested in, since they must have excellent, resilient businesses to sustain dividend programs for decades. Healthcare leaders Merck (MRK 2.08%) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT 1.31%) are among the companies that have the profile of forever dividend stocks. Here's what income-seeking investors need to know about them.\n\n1. Merck\n\nMerck is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The drugmaker's lineup is fairly deep and features the best-selling drug in the world: Cancer medicine Keytruda. Merck is also a leader in the animal health industry. It has been around for decades and has maintained a dividend program for a long time. Merck's current annual dividend per share tops $3.24 with a forward yield of about 3.3%, compared to the S&P 500's average of 1.3%.\n\nMerck's track record speaks volumes. Developing novel medicines is an expensive and risky activity. However, the company has done it regularly enough to maintain decent revenue and earnings growth, allowing it to grow its payouts over time. Some might be skeptical of Merck's prospects from here on out.\n\nKeytruda will face a patent cliff in 2028. Although the drugmaker has planned for that by developing a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the medicine that will extend its patent life, SC Keytruda will face mounting competition from medicines in development, such as Summit Therapeutics' ivonescimab.\n\nThankfully, the original version of Keytruda should continue growing its sales largely unaffected through 2028, since ivonescimab is still in clinical trials, albeit late-stage ones. Beyond that, Merck is betting on its ability to identify and develop promising candidates, which has served it well over the years. The company has penned a deal to develop a potential GLP-1 weight loss therapy, HS-10535, with China-based Hansoh Pharma.\n\nIt signed a similar licensing deal with LaNova Medicines for the development of LM-299, a potential cancer medicine. LM-299 is a bispecific antibody, a class of oncology products that could grow significantly in prominence thanks to relatively recent breakthroughs in the field. Keytruda's would-be challenger, ivonescimab, is part of this class of drugs, as is BioNTech's BNT327, another medicine being touted as a future Keytruda competitor.\n\nMerck's recent moves show that it won't simply roll over. The company will continue creating new drugs, just as it has before. Its pipeline features several dozen programs. Here's the bottom line: Merck is an innovator in an industry whose products and services will only attract higher demand over time, especially with an aging population. The company should perform well over the long run and maintain its dividend program.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories' business spans several areas of the healthcare sector, including medical devices (its most important unit), nutrition, diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals. The company has dozens of products under its brands, some of which are among the leaders in their respective niches. For instance, Abbott Laboratories' FreeStyle Libre product line is one of the most lucrative in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) market, which is practically a duopoly it shares with DexCom.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' Similac baby formula brand is well known, as are the products under its Ensure brand that provide nutritional supplements. Abbott Laboratories has maintained a strong business for years, and its dividend program is exceptional. The healthcare leader is a Dividend King with an active streak of 52 consecutive payout increases. Abbott Laboratories' annual dividend per share and forward yield are $2.36 and 2%, respectively.\n\nConsidering its track record and long-term prospects, the company's dividend looks pretty safe. Abbott Laboratories should benefit from many tailwinds that will boost its financial performance. Chief among them is the company's work in diabetes care, especially its FreeStyle Libre franchise.\n\nThis suite of CGM devices helps diabetes patients keep track of their blood sugar levels better than blood glucose meters. However, despite the benefits associated with the use of CGMs, Abbott estimated that only 1% of diabetes patients worldwide use this technology.\n\nSo, there is a massive runway for growth here, and it won't be the only one for Abbott Laboratories. Abbott should continue delivering good financial results while growing its payouts. This healthcare stock is a clear winner for those seeking long-term dividend income.",

The massive industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.99% between 2025 and 2030, reaching a market size of $955.49 billion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThis significant growth can be attributed to various megatrends in the healthcare sector. The aging population worldwide is one of the primary factors affecting the industry. This is especially true in high-income countries such as the US, as around 17% of the country\u2019s population is 65 or older as of 2023. This is causing an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, which is ultimately driving the demand for medical devices.\n\nThis demand is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decades. According to statistics by the United Nations, the number of people aged 65 or older is anticipated to represent around 16% of the world\u2019s population by 2050, which translates to around 1.5 billion people worldwide. This demographic shift is anticipated to materialize especially prominently in regions such as Europe and North America, where the population of 65 or older is expected to reach 26.9% by 2050.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Furniture Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nContinued Growth in the US Medical Device Manufacturing Sector\n\nIn addition, technological advancements such as the increasing use of AI, predictive analysis, and advanced algorithms are metamorphosing the healthcare technology industry. While North America is the largest medical device market, Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing.\n\nAnother report by Grand View Research estimates that the market size of medical device manufacturers in the US is around $256.2 billion as of 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% between 2025 and 2030. The primary reasons behind this growth include the increasing geriatric population, the growing number of road and sports accidents, the expanding geographic reach of the key players in the market, and the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures in the industry.\n\nThe Future of the Healthcare Industry in the US\n\nAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth.\n\nIn addition, pharmacy services, especially those focused on specialty pharmacy, are expected to see continued growth. The launch of new therapies and increased utilization are expected to be the primary drivers of this growth. McKinsey estimates specialty pharmacy revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, growing EBITDA for managed service providers and specialty pharmacies. Therefore, optimistic trends are materializing for the healthcare industry as a whole, including the medical device sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 medical device stocks. We then selected the top 10 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

Its business segments include Medical Devices, Diagnostic Products, Established Pharmaceutical Products, and Nutritional Products. Its Medical Devices segment manages the global sales of heart failure, rhythm management, structural heart, electrophysiology, neuromodulation, and diabetes care products.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\u2019s (NYSE:ABT) innovative abilities, diversified business, and industry expertise lend it a competitive market edge. In fiscal Q4 2024, the company generated $8.5 billion in operating cash flow, which it used to reinvest in its business by repaying debts, funding capacity expansions, and returning $5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nThe company\u2019s main business highlights several growth opportunities. Its FreeStyle Libre franchise in the diabetes care unit, which comprises a range of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, has been one of the most significant growth drivers for the company and holds the potential to expand its market share.

            "content": "Abbott (ABT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs have returned +16%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Abbott falls in, has gained 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAbbott is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.15 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.73 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Abbott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Abbott.\n\nStory Continues",

These newborn NEC formula lawsuits make a lot of allegations. But at their core, they allege that the makers of these formulas knew of the risk of NEC and did nothing to warn families and give them a choice.\n\nIf your premature baby was diagnosed with NEC after being given Similac or Enfamil formula, you may be able to participate in a class action lawsuit against the formula companies and receive financial compensation for the harm that was done to your child.\n\nOur law firm is currently seeking new preemie baby formula lawsuits to represent families who have suffered as a result of this infant formula. Our NEC formula lawyers are bringing lawsuits against baby formula manufacturers. Three cases have already gone to trial in state court as we discuss below. The first trial in the MDL will be in May 2025.\n\nOn this page, you will find:\n\nThe latest news and updates on the ongoing NEC infant formula litigation in federal and state courts, How our toxic NEC formula lawyers believe these claims will unfold, and Predicted settlement payouts if this litigation is as successful as expected.\n\nCall our baby formula lawyers today in all 50 states at 800-553-8082. Time may be limited to bring an NEC lawsuit. Call our attorneys right now.\n\nNEC Class Action Lawsuit Status Updates\n\nI know many of you are closely following the NEC baby formula lawsuit. So before we get into the substance of these lawsuits, let me give you a quick update on the latest in the litigation.\n\nFebruary 11, 2025 \u2013 Motion for Summary Judgment in the MDL\n\nThe defendants in the NEC baby formula multidistrict litigation have moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs have failed to provide admissible expert testimony establishing that cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula causes necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. Their argument largely hinges on their effort to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, Dr. Logan Spector and Dr. Jennifer Sucre, under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. If successful, this would leave plaintiffs without the necessary expert testimony on general causation, which defendants argue is a fatal flaw requiring dismissal of all cases. But this is not likely.\n\nThis motion reads much like a \u201cWhy did you even file this lawsuit?\u201d, which ignores that judges and juries have already rejected similar defenses and ordered the formula makers to pay substantial verdicts. In March 2024, a St. Clair County, Illinois jury awarded $60 million in damages to the family of a preterm infant who developed NEC after being fed a cow\u2019s milk-based formula. Just a few months later, in July 2024, a Missouri jury returned a $495 million verdict against Abbott Laboratories, finding that their Similac formula contributed to a baby\u2019s NEC diagnosis. Defendants\u2019 motion seems to forget this.\n\nThe defense argument relies heavily on a report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Working Group, which stated that it is \u201cthe absence of human milk\u2014rather than exposure to formula\u201d\u2014that is associated with NEC. They also cite a joint statement from the FDA, CDC, and NIH, which concluded that there is \u201cno conclusive evidence that preterm infant formula causes NEC.\u201d\n\nBut finding some things that might support your claim does not mean you get summary judgment. Plaintiffs\u2019 response will point to a growing body of research and internal corporate documents suggesting that formula companies have long known about the risks but failed to warn doctors or parents. The summary judgment motion, if granted, would shut down every case in the MDL, but the litigation history\u2014including prior massive jury verdicts\u2014suggests otherwise.\n\nJanuary 26, 2025 \u2013 Motion to Exclude Expert\n\nAbbott Laboratories and other defendants in the Preterm Infant Nutrition MDL have moved to exclude Dr. Jennifer Sucre, an extremely highly qualified neonatologist, from presenting her opinions on the link between formula feeding and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.\n\nDr. Sucre is the real deal. She is a nationally recognized neonatologist and physician-scientist at Vanderbilt University, whose groundbreaking research bridges the gap between clinical care and cutting-edge science to improve outcomes for preterm infants. With a deep expertise in cellular mechanisms and preterm infant health, her peer-reviewed work has advanced critical understanding in neonatal medicine, making her a trusted authority in her field. Somehow, he defendants attempt to paint Dr. Sucre as unqualified, claiming her expertise in lung development diminishes her ability to testify on NEC, despite her medical credentials and her reliance on established biological mechanisms. They further dismiss her reliance on animal and in vitro studies, ignoring the ethical and practical limitations of conducting human trials on such a fragile population. Their strategy is clear: undermine a credible expert to limit the scope of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and shield themselves from accountability. You cannot blame the defendants for trying to get rid of Dr. Sucre before trial. They do not want the jury to hear her testimony because it will be very credible and damaging to them. January 24, 2025: Joint Status Report The Joint Status Report filed today in the MDL outlines a streamlined pretrial briefing schedule agreed upon by both parties to address Rule 702 motions (expert witness testimony) and dispositive motions. The purpose is to wisely reduce complexity and focus on key issues, deferring certain case-specific motions to trial-specific dates while proceeding with general causation motions and select expert challenges. Key elements include a staggered schedule for briefing motions related to general and case-specific experts, agreed page limits for filings, and plans to resolve disputes over supplemental reports and depositions. The parties have also set dates for motions in limine and the final pretrial conference for the first bellwether trial, emphasizing collaboration to avoid scheduling conflicts as the litigation progresses. Trial in the Mar case is set to begin on May 5, 2025.\n\nJanuary 9, 2025: Status Conference\n\nThere status conference in the MDL set today was postponed. It has not yet been reschedule.\n\nJanuary 8, 2025: Bellwether Trial Schedule\n\nThe dates for the first four bellwether trials:\n\nMay 5, 2025: Mar v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-00232 August 11, 2025: K.B. v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-05356 November 3, 2025: Brown v. Abbott Laboratories, Case No. 1:22-cv-02001 February 2, 2026: Inman v. Mead Johnson & Company, LLC, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-0373\n\nThe hope is a global settlement before any of these trial begin. But we will see.\n\nJanuary 5, 2025: 6 Cases Added to MDL\n\nOnly 6 new preterm infant formula NEC cases were added to the MDL during the month of December. That is a notable decrease over the monthly volume we saw the prior 2 months. There are now 632 pending cases in the MDL.\n\nDecember 13, 2024: State Versus Federal Court\n\nThe Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has refused to remand a lawsuit to California state court, keeping the case within the NEC MDL consolidated in Illinois federal court. The suit alleges that Similac and Enfamil formulas for premature babies caused necrotizing enterocolitis after a child was fed the formula in a hospital shortly after birth in May 2014.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the child required surgery and continues to suffer long-term health consequences. The panel rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that federal subject jurisdiction was lacking, noting that such objections do not typically impede transfer.\n\nWhile this MDL progresses, state court cases involving NEC claims against Abbott and Mead Johnson have moved more quickly, resulting in three verdicts, including a $495 million total damages award in Missouri earlier this year and a $60 million verdict against Mead Johnson. So many plaintiffs, like this one, are looking hard at state court options.\n\nDecember 2, 2024: Case Update\n\nThe NEC infant formula MDL maintained its pace from October, adding 26 new cases again in November\u2014a 4.3% increase\u2014bringing the total to 626 cases. Because you are seeing verdicts in state court, more lawsuits are being filed in state court in recent months.\n\nNovember 26, 2024: Next Hearing\n\nJudge Pallmeyer has scheduled an in-court status hearing for December 19, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. The status hearing will likely address key issues, including the bellwether selection trial preparation updates, the progress of discovery, and, with any luck, settlement efforts. Both sides will present their view on trial readiness and any unresolved disputes that could impact the timeline.\n\nNovember 21, 2024: Reflections on First Loss\n\nThe recent defense win in Missouri highlights the unpredictable nature of jury trials. While the plaintiffs in that case faced a setback, the verdict is unlikely to halt the momentum of the broader NEC litigation. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys remain optimistic, pointing to the substantial compensatory and punitive damages awarded in prior state court trials as evidence of the litigation\u2019s overall strength.\n\nNovember 16, 2024: Donor Milk\n\nWe are seeing more NICUs prioritizing donor milk for preterm infants to reduce NEC risk. These decisions are influenced by the growing body of research linking NEC to cow milk. Does the NEC litigation also push them in the direction? Of course.\n\nNovember 1, 2024: First Loss in Missouri Trial Today\n\nThe defense verdict in Missouri yesterday will not slow the momentum of this litigation. In October, 26 new cases were added, bringing the total to over 600 pending cases. Many more are being filed in state court. Right now, the state court litigation is blowing past the MDL in terms of settling the tone of this litigation and that is causing more plaintiffs to file in state court.\n\nYesterday I was talking about the tea leaves pointing to a plaintiff\u2019s victory. You can never predict how a trial will turn out. Defendants go their first defense verdict in Whitfield. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer were certainly confident. They asked for $6 billion in punitive damages in closing statements.\n\nOctober 31, 2024: Trial Update\n\nThings are getting pretty crazy at the NEC baby formula trial in Missouri. A judge sanctioned Kirkland & Ellis partner James Hurst, barring him from presenting evidence or making closing arguments for the rest of the trial. The sanction came after Judge Michael Noble found Hurst in \u201cbad faith on several occasions,\u201d criticizing him for repeatedly violating court orders, allegedly to sway the jury unfairly. Hurst, representing Abbott Laboratories, is accused of introducing inflammatory evidence despite prior restrictions.\n\nJudge Noble noted that Hurst\u2019s actions seemed aimed at provoking a mistrial, describing his approach as \u201cdilatory litigation tactics\u201d potentially violating Missouri\u2019s legal ethics rules. This may be a canary in the coal mine for how this case will go. If Abbott is looking to get a mistrial, they cannot be happy with where this trial appears to be going.\n\nOctober 26 2024: Trial Continues\n\nWe are into the defense case in the Whitfield trial. Defense expert Dr. David Stevenson testified that he believes Kaine Whitfield, the child at the center of the case, has a genetic condition\u2014possibly Kabuki syndrome\u2014that could explain his intellectual impairments.\n\nThe family, of course, alleges his issues stem from necrotizing enterocolitis which they say was caused by Abbott\u2019s and Mead\u2019s cow-milk formulas given after the child\u2019s premature birth. The child also had significant bowel removal, resulting in short bowel syndrome, impacting his nutrient absorption.\n\nFun fact: Dr. Stevenson never bothered to evaluate the child to form his opinions.\n\nOctober 9, 2024: Status Conference Tomorrow\n\nAs we keep a hopeful eye on the Whitfield trial, there is a status conference tomorrow in the MDL. The key issues include:\n\nMotions Pending: There are several motions pending, including a motion by plaintiffs to dismiss non-cancer related cases without prejudice, a motion to enforce discovery orders against L\u2019Or\u00e9al that we have talked about, and motions to dismiss filed by multiple defendants (that are going nowhere). Bellwether Process: The parties are working on establishing a bellwether process to select representative cases for early trials we told you about yesterday. Defendant-Specific Discovery Issues: Several defendants, such as Strength of Nature and Namaste Laboratories, have pending motions related to document production and protective orders. Revlon has produced a significant number of documents in response to discovery requests, but plaintiffs are still reviewing these for completeness. \u201cSecond-Wave\u201d Defendants: Motions to dismiss have been filed by defendants like Advanced Beauty, John Paul Mitchell, and Wella Operations, with responses and replies being reviewed. Amendment to Case Management Order 10: The parties are working on an amendment to streamline the process of identifying and tracking plaintiffs, particularly those dismissed without prejudice, to ensure compliance and ease of re-filing if necessary.\n\nOctober 7, 2024: New NEC Trial\n\nOpening statements kicked off the latest NEC baby formula trial in Whitfield v. St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital. Testimony will continue today. See our October 1 update.\n\nWhat sets this case apart from the other two verdicts is that the doctors are being sued. Why would the doctors be responsible in these lawsuits? If the doctor is going to say on the witness stand, \u201cSure, we knew the risks, but we went ahead and fed the infant cow-milk formula anyway and did not bother to tell the parents of the risks,\u201d they are also responsible. This is particularly true if, like this case, the hospital had donor milk available as an option. What parent would not take donor milk if properly advised of the risks?\n\nNEC baby formula cases in the MDL have pinned blame squarely on the formula makers for not slapping a big, glaring warning label of the obvious risks of the product. But when the healthcare providers say it would not have mattered anyway, they will become defendants in these cases.\n\nOctober 3, 2024: \u201cThey Already Knew\u201d Defense\n\nOne of the defense arguments in this litigation that perplexes me is the idea that you did not have to warn because of the risk of NEC with baby formula because the hospitals already knew of the risk.\n\nThe argument ignores the primary purpose of a warning label, which is to inform all potential users\u2014not just specialized medical staff\u2014of the associated risks to enable informed decision-making. Warning labels are not just for hospitals. They are for parents, caregivers, and even other healthcare providers who may not be as familiar with the specific risks.\n\nBut it does deeper than that. By failing to include a warning, manufacturers are assuming that every single stakeholder already has complete knowledge of the risks. This assumption is unreasonable and places the burden entirely on healthcare providers to remember, communicate, and mitigate every risk without adequate support or resources. Moreover, even if some hospitals are aware of the risks, not all of them may be up-to-date on the most recent research, and a warning label would give them a heads-up to really consider the costs and the benefits of cow-based milk.\n\nOctober 1, 2024: MDL Case Totals\n\nThe NEC infant formula class action MDL added 27 new cases during the month of September. That brings the total number of cases in the MDL up to 598. After these two huge verdicts, you can expect more claims to be filed in the months to come.\n\nBut the energy in this litigation right now is not in the MDL. A new kicked off in Missouri yesterday. A family is suing Abbott, Reckitt, and St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital. The lawsuits claims their formulas caused their premature son \u2013 born at 28 weeks \u2013 to develop necrotizing enterocolitis in 2017. The family seeks compensation for the severe, permanent injuries her son continues to suffer.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024: Trial Dates in the MDL\n\nThe lawyers are expected to provide a joint submission on Friday of proposed trial dates.\n\nSeptember 23, 2024: NIH Funded Study on Donor Milk and NEC\n\nA National Institutes of Health-funded study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that extremely preterm infants fed donated human milk had half the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) compared to those fed formula (4.2% vs. 9%).\n\nThe study involved 483 infants born before 29 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 1,000 grams. While the donor milk-fed infants grew slightly slower than formula-fed infants, there were no significant differences in neurological development between the two groups as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 22 to 26 months corrected age.\n\nThe study provides strong scientific evidence that donor human milk reduces the risk of NEC in extremely preterm infants compared to formula feeding. In the context of NEC baby formula litigation, it bolsters plaintiffs\u2019 claims by highlighting the increased risk associated with formula feeding in this vulnerable population.\n\nSeptember 9, 2024: Junk Science\n\nPredictably, tort reform lobbyists are criticizing the two recent large NEC baby formula verdicts. A Missouri jury awarded $95 million in compensatory damages and $400 million in punitive damages, while a similar case in Illinois resulted in a $60 million verdict against Mead Johnson in March.\n\nThis article\u2019s main focus is an attack on the motives of trial lawyers, rather than engaging with the substance of the legal claims. Much of the content seems like a recycled argument from the last article on a different tort. The author leans on the familiar \u201cjunk science\u201d narrative without providing any explanation or evidence to support why this science is faulty. There really is meaningful junk science arguments in this litigation. The only substantive concern raised is the fear that manufacturers may stop producing formula for preterm infant. I agree, it is a valid worry. But it cannot justify discouraging meritorious lawsuits for children and families that have suffered so much. This is particularly true when all the defendants have to do to solve the problem moving forward is to warn doctors and parents of the obviously risk of NEC to premature babies so they can make an informed choice. That is it.\n\nAugust 26, 2024: Mar v. Abbott Laboratories Case Facts\n\nYesterday we told you the Mar case was up first. Let\u2019s talk about the facts of this wrongful death claim.\n\nIn January 2014, a premature baby was born at Summersville Regional Medical Center in West Virginia. Weighing just 3 pounds and measuring a little over 15 inches, she was immediately transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at CAMC Women and Children\u2019s Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia, where she received specialized care.\n\nInitially, the baby was fed exclusively on breast milk provided by her mother, who worked hard to pump and supply her milk. However, on January 14th and 15th, the hospital introduced Similac Special Care 24, a cow\u2019s milk-based product, into her feeding regimen. Shortly after, the baby developed severe symptoms, including a distended abdomen and bloody stool. She was diagnosed with NEC.\n\nThe situation rapidly worsened, and on January 15th, the baby had to undergo emergency surgery, where doctors found significant damage to her intestines, including necrosis (tissue death) and a perforation. Despite the medical interventions, the baby tragically passed away on January 16, 2014.\n\nAt the time of her death, the baby\u2019s parents had no idea that the cow\u2019s milk-based formula she had been fed may have caused or significantly contributed to the development of NEC. The baby\u2019s mother filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Abbott seeking justice for her daughter.\n\nAugust 25, 2024: Parties Agree On Order Of First Four Bellwether Trials\n\nThe parties have agreed on the order of the first four bellwether trials, pending the resolution of dispositive motions and reserving the right to seek summary judgment in any of these cases. This stipulation is submitted for the Court\u2019s consideration instead of the previously planned competing position papers. The proposed trial order is as follows:\n\nMar v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-00232) Diggs v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-05356) Etienne & Brown v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 1:22-cv-02001) Inman v. Mead Johnson & Co. (Case No. 1:22-cv-03737)\n\nThe parties request that the August 29, 2024, Status Conference be held remotely instead of in-person, as initially planned. The parties will be available to address any questions the Court may have.\n\nAugust 17, 2024: Philadelphia Expected As Next Focal Point Of NEC Lawsuits\n\nNEC litigation has predominantly taken place in state courts and through federal claims within the Illinois MDL. The big verdict in St. Louis last month has now put a spotlight on Missouri as well.\n\nPhiladelphia is poised to become the next focal point, known for being a supportive venue for victims seeking justice. NEC baby formula lawsuits in Philadelphia are not consolidated, thus no class action exists\u2014each lawsuit is addressed on its own merits.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a distinct tactic NEC lawyers are using involves plaintiffs suing the hospitals, a move that complicates the defense for manufacturers like Mead Johnson and Abbott. Typically, defendants aim to align their defense strategies. Yet, the significant verdicts might tempt hospitals to distance themselves from manufacturers, blaming them for inadequate warnings about product risks.\n\nThe first trial in Philadelphia addressing NEC-related injuries from baby formula is anticipated to commence this spring.\n\nAugust 9, 2024: Mead Johnson Files Notice To Remove NEC Lawsuit To MDL In Illinois\n\nMead Johnson filed a notice to remove an NEC lawsuit to the MDL in Illinois.\n\nThe plaintiff, a Virginia resident, alleges that his premature infant daughter developed NEC and subsequently died after consuming Mead Johnson\u2019s preterm infant formula in 2007. The defendants argue that the case meets the criteria for federal jurisdiction due to diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a), 1441, and 1446, as the plaintiff and the Mead Johnson defendants are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n\nMead asserts that Abbott Laboratories and Abbott were fraudulently joined to prevent removal under the forum defendant rule since there is no claim that the child consumed any products manufactured by Abbott. The notice contends that Abbott\u2019s involvement is a sham to obstruct the removal process. The defendants emphasize that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Abbott have no reasonable possibility of success under Virginia law, which governs this case, because the injury and related events occurred in Virginia\n\nWhether this case is heard in Virginia or Illinois, Mead is going to have to offer a fair settlement or face a jury.\n\nJuly 31, 2024: Plaintiffs\u2019 Lawyers Granted Permission To Depose Five Individuals\n\nThings are still plodding along in the federal MDL. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were granted permission to depose five individuals by August 20, 2024:\n\nDan Achimov \u2013 Worked in portfolio management and product innovation, potentially holding information on the company\u2019s infant formula products, including those implicated in the NEC litigation.\n\n\u2013 Worked in portfolio management and product innovation, potentially holding information on the company\u2019s infant formula products, including those implicated in the NEC litigation. Brian Berg \u2013 A scientist associated with pre-clinical research on NEC and involved in product innovation at Mead Johnson, potentially providing insight into scientific studies and product development.\n\n\u2013 A scientist associated with pre-clinical research on NEC and involved in product innovation at Mead Johnson, potentially providing insight into scientific studies and product development. Craig Hadley \u2013 Former Head of Regulatory for Infant Formula and Child Nutrition Innovation, with knowledge about Mead Johnson\u2019s regulatory compliance and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n\n\u2013 Former Head of Regulatory for Infant Formula and Child Nutrition Innovation, with knowledge about Mead Johnson\u2019s regulatory compliance and interactions with regulatory agencies. Daniel Secada \u2013 Senior Vice President of Nutrition, sitting on Mead Johnson\u2019s Nutrition Leadership Team, possibly overseeing decisions related to infant formula products, including preterm infant formula development.\n\n\u2013 Senior Vice President of Nutrition, sitting on Mead Johnson\u2019s Nutrition Leadership Team, possibly overseeing decisions related to infant formula products, including preterm infant formula development. Justin Wells \u2013 A marketing executive involved in project management and potential partnerships related to the key issue of cow\u2019s milk formula alternatives, relevant to the litigation focusing on product content and marketing practices.\n\nThe court will maintain the existing deadline for the close of fact discovery on August 9, 2024, allowing for a potential limited extension if necessary for outstanding written discovery requests.\n\nThe order follows a dispute over delays in scheduling depositions and obtaining written discovery, which was partly due to Mead Johnson\u2019s involvement in a related state-court case. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers had served new discovery requests after the initial cutoff date, which Mead Johnson opposed, leading to ongoing discussions to resolve these outstanding issues.\n\nCertainly, the MDL court feels new pressure to move these cases along with these state court cases going to verdict.\n\nJuly 26, 2024: Missouri Jury Awards $495 Million In Damages\n\nThis litigation will never be the same. Today, a Missouri jury awarded a game changing $495 million in damages \u2013 $95 million in compensatory and $400 million in punitive damages \u2013 to an Illinois girl who developed necrotizing enterocolitis after consuming Abbott Laboratories\u2019 specialized formula for premature infants. Abbott and Mead dismissed the first verdict for $40 million as a fluke. They cannot do that anymore. Why Abbott let this case go to trial is hard to fathom. Abbott lost about $8 billion in value after the verdict in after hours trading. What had to freak out investors is that jury did not just find Abbott negligent. It awarded $400 million in damages. That can only mean the jurors were disgusted by what Abbott did. That is the canary in the coal mine of where this litigation is going. If Mead and Abbott have any sense, they will try to settle as many NEC baby formula lawsuits as they possibly can.\n\nJuly 19, 2024: Abbott CEO Contemplated Withdrawing Premature Infant Formula From Market\n\nAbbott CEO Robert Ford says the company is contemplating the possibility of withdrawing its premature infant formula for premature babies from the market amid legal and safety concerns.\n\nOf course, Ford called for public health officials to take action, emphasizing that the formula is vital for neonatal intensive care units. He criticized the lawsuits, labeling the claims as lacking merit and scientific support. There is another path and Ford knows it. If they put an honest warning label on the product, rather than pulling it from the market, they can continue to make money off the product and eliminate any future lawsuits moving forward. It just requires transparency about the risks so parents can make an informed choice.\n\nJuly 11, 2024: First Trial Against Abbott For Infant Formula Begins In Missouri\n\nThe first trial against Abbott for infant formula designed for premature babies began in Missouri, with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney arguing that Abbott\u2019s cow\u2019s milk-based formula, sold under the Similac brand, caused a plaintiff\u2019s daughter to develop necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nThis is a huge trial that will have a bellwether effect the NEC settlement amounts throughout the litigation. This trial follows a similar case where a jury awarded $60 million to a mother whose premature baby died after receiving Enfamil infant formula made by Mead Johnson, marking the first NEC-related verdict. See the March 15 update below.\n\nJune 30, 2024: New Lawsuit Filed In NEC MDL\n\nA new NEC lawsuit was filed on Friday alleging that a prematurely born infant at Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, developed severe health complications after being fed cow\u2019s milk-based products. The infant, born on June 19, 2002, was given products including Enfamil Premature Infant Formula and Enfamil Human Milk Fortifier shortly after birth.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, shortly after consuming these cow\u2019s milk-based products, the infant developed NEC. The condition, as it usually does, led to severe complications, necessitated surgery, and resulted in ongoing negative long-term health effects for the child.\n\nThe plaintiffs assert that the NEC and subsequent health issues have caused significant financial and economic losses, as well as emotional distress. They also claim that they were not informed of the risks associated with feeding cow\u2019s milk-based products to preterm infants. The lawsuit alleges that if the mother had been aware of the potential health risks, she would not have allowed these products to be used.\n\nIt is noteworthy that NEC lawyers continue to file lawsuits for victims whose injuries occurred over twenty years ago. These are viable claims, but the challenge in many of these cases is finding the medical records from that time to support them.\n\nJune 29, 2024: NEC MDL Schedule Moving Forward\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the schedule moving forward:\n\nEvent Date Close of fact discovery August 9, 2024 Parties to submit position papers regarding the representativeness of the trial selections August 23, 2024 Plaintiffs to submit reports of general experts and case-specific experts in all trial selections September 25, 2024 Defendants to submit reports of general experts and case-specific experts in all trial selections October 28, 2024 Parties to submit rebuttal expert reports November 15, 2024 Depositions of experts November 4, 2024 through January 10, 2025 Summary judgment and/or Daubert motions (for all trial selections) January 24, 2025 Responses to summary judgment and/or Daubert motions February 28, 2025 Replies in support of summary judgment and/or Daubert motions March 14, 2025 Hearing(s) on summary judgment and/or Daubert motions March 24, 2025 Final pretrial conference in first bellwether trial April 17, 2025 Start of first bellwether trial May 5, 2025\n\nJune 17, 2024: NEC Test Trial To Begin May 5th 2025\n\nThe first NEC baby formula test trial in the MDL will be on May 5, 2025.\n\nMay 30, 2024: New NEC Lawsuit Filed This Week Highlights The Fact That Many NEC Cases Occurred Long Ago\n\nA NEC lawsuit filed this week underscores that many of these cases occurred long ago. This case involves a premature infant born at 32 weeks and 6 days gestation on May 29, 2004, at Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas. Weighing less than six pounds at birth, the infant was admitted to the NICU (Level II) and initially placed on low-volume D10W. The infant was fed Enfamil Premature 20, a cow\u2019s milk-based formula, via continuous feedings.\n\nAround June 1, 2004, the infant developed symptoms indicative of NEC, including emesis with abdominal distention, bloody stools, and x-ray imaging revealing dilated loops of bowel pneumatosis and portal air. Diagnosed with NEC, the infant was immediately taken off formula feedings, received blood transfusions, and was prescribed double antibiotics.\n\nDue to worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, and increasing abdominal distension, the infant required intubation from June 3 to June 7, 2004. Subsequently, the infant was transferred to Texas Children\u2019s Hospital NICU for continued management and remained there until being discharged home on July 23, 2004.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the infant\u2019s mother was unaware that the cow\u2019s milk-based formula could cause NEC, holding the formula manufacturers accountable for the severe health complications that ensued.\n\nMay 15, 2024: MDL Judge Kept Nevada NEC Lawsuit In Illinois State Court\n\nIn a new opinion, the MDL judge kept a Nevada NEC lawsuit in Illinois state court, where it was originally filed. The claim at issue is a classic NEC lawsuit. A child was born prematurely and given Mead\u2019s formula at a Nevada hospital, leading to a diagnosis of NEC and significant medical interventions, including extensive bowel removal. The child has spastic cerebral palsy.\n\nThe backstory is an NEC lawsuit was originally filed in Illinois state court, believing that Mead maintained its principal place of business there. However, after Mead transferred the case to federal court in Nevada, it was eventually sent back to Illinois for consolidated pretrial proceedings as part of MDL No. 3026.\n\nTwo years into the case, the plaintiffs\u2019 NEC lawyers found new evidence suggesting potential negligence by Nevada medical staff in treating the plaintiff\u2019s child. This led to a motion to amend the complaint to include these staff as defendants and remand the case to state court due to a lack of complete diversity.\n\nAs the case evolved, an expert\u2019s testimony pointing to the radiologist for a delay in the diagnosis of NEC led to the inclusion of that doctor as a defendant. The destroyed complete diversity of citizenship and potentially remand the case to state court.\n\nThere are different views about whether MDL or Illinois state court is the better venue for an NEC lawsuit. Certainly, the recent $60 million verdict helped push many attorneys into the state court camp.\n\nMay 8, 2024: MDL Judge Issues New CMO To Encourage Cautious Naming Of Defendants\n\nMany plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are reflexively naming both defendants in NEC lawsuits. The MDL judge, wanting to force victims\u2019 lawyers to be more circumspect in who is named as a defendant, has issued a new case management order specifically targeting the involvement of Mead Johnson & Company. The Order stipulated the company should only be named in cases where there is clear evidence that the infant consumed their manufactured or distributed products.\n\nThe court outlines specific protocols for identifying such products. Before filing a lawsuit, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys must thoroughly review all the infant\u2019s medical and feeding records from birth through discharge to verify product usage. If these records do not conclusively show Mead Johnson\u2019s products were used, attorneys must engage in further investigation to obtain this proof.\n\nFailure to properly identify Mead Johnson products or comply with these protocols can result in dismissal from the lawsuit. The order emphasizes thorough pre-suit diligence by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to ensure only relevant cases involving Mead Johnson proceed in this NEC baby formula MDL.\n\nApril 5, 2024: New Lawyers Enter Their Appearances For Mead Johnson In MDL\n\nA lot of new lawyers entered their appearances for Mead Johnson this week in the MDL. Could it be a coincidence? Sure. But I like to think they are rattled by that $60 million verdict.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: Illinois State Court Jury Awards $60 Million To Plaintiffs In NEC Lawsuit\n\nAn Illinois state court jury awarded $60 million to plaintiffs in a state court NEC lawsuit against Mead Johnson. The jury found that the company did not adequately warn of the risks of NEC associated with its cow\u2019s milk-based formula for premature infants and that failure to warn led to a child\u2019s death.\n\nThis is the first NEC failure-to-warn lawsuit to go to trial. This landmark decision is bound to bring new attention to this litigation. The jury sent a real message. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers asked for $25 million, and the jury awarded $60 million. It is hard to imagine a stronger statement.\n\nMarch 7, 2024: MDL Judge Tells NEC Lawyers She Is Willing To Monitor Depositions To Assure Compliance\n\nJudge Rebecca Pallmeyer told NEC baby formula lawyers she was willing to monitor depositions to assure compliance. The problem for plaintiffs in most MDLs is corporate witnesses who will not answer questions. Certainly, having a federal judge listening to your deposition testimony has a chilling impact on the urge to be noncompliant. The judge encouraged the parties to communicate any difficulties during depositions and reiterated her availability to assist as needed.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: Four Bellwether Cases Selected To Go To Trial\n\nFour critical \u201cbellwether\u201d cases have been selected to go to trial in the NEC class action lawsuit in federal court, providing insights into how juries might react to evidence presented in all related lawsuits. These trials involve cases of infant death and severe complications due to NEC after being fed the formulas. While the first trial date hasn\u2019t been set, they are expected to begin by 2024. The outcomes of these bellwether trials could influence potential settlements or further individual trials.\n\nYou would think and hope that a NEC formula settlement will happen before, during, or immediately after this stretch of trials. I think Mead and Abbott would be foolish to let even one of these lawsuits go forward. If plaintiffs get a huge verdict, it will be hard to put the genie back into the bottle regarding settlement amount expectations.\n\nBut what if they do not settle after these four bellwether trials? If no settlements are reached after the initial four trial dates, Judge Pallmeyer will likely send many individual cases back to various U.S. District Courts nationwide for their own trial dates.\n\nAugust 21, 2023: Peyton v. Abbott Filed Directly Into NEC MDL\n\nPeyton v. Abbott, a new NEC lawsuit, was directly filed into the MDL (1:22-cv-00071) in Illinois on Friday. This lawsuit addresses the harm and injuries endured by a mother and her minor child from NEC. The child has faced extensive health challenges due to consuming a bovine-milk-based infant formula produced by Abbott Laboratories Inc. The child developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after being fed Abbott\u2019s cows\u2019 milk-based formula. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit underscores the effort Abbott made to promote the idea that Similac products are similar to breast milk, marketing Similac as an optimal option for infants.\n\nAnticipating a potential statute of limitations defense because the case is 17 years old, Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers alleged that because of Abbott\u2019s deceptive advertising and insufficient warnings, the Plaintiffs were unaware that using its cow milk-based formula could considerably heighten the risk of NEC. The mother only became aware of this risk within two years of filing her lawsuit.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Statute of Limitations Issues Expected To Be A Battle In Some NEC Lawsuits\n\nThe issue of the statute of limitations will be a battle in some NEC lawsuits. While we\u2019re confident plaintiffs\u201d are on the right side of this issue in most, if not all, claims, it will be a complex battle in certain cases.\n\nA San Francisco Superior Court judge has tentatively approved Abbott Laboratories\u2019 motion to dismiss sixteen lawsuits related to NEC baby formula. The judge\u2019s decision offers parents the chance to revise and refile their complaint and the battle with renew. Lawyers for the parents maintain that the two-year timeframe to file their complaints should commence only when they recognize the alleged problems with the formula. This stance tracks with established legal principles of fundamental fairness\u2014who do you sue when the basis for your lawsuit has been kept from you?\n\nJune 28, 2023: Hayes v. Mead Johnson & Co Transferred Into NEC MDL\n\nHayes v. Mead Johnson & Co, LLC, et al. (3:23-cv-62) is one of the most recent cases to be transferred into the NEC infant formula class action MDL. The case was originally filed in the Southern District of Indiana by Sandra Smith, as guardian of Adam Smith.\n\nAdam Smith was born very prematurely (23 weeks) in April 2003. After his birth, Adam was given Enfamil Premature 24 formula, a cow\u2019s milk-based product made by Mead Johnson. Adam was given the formula 28 times in the first month of his life.\n\nDuring that time, he developed various symptoms of gastrointestinal distress. He was diagnosed with NEC and had to undergo surgery to remove a section of his bowel, and continues to live with various complications. (The case is a matter of public record, but we did change the last names.)\n\nApril 25, 2022: Final Case-Specific Discovery Plan Approved For Bellwether Cases\n\nThe final case-specific discovery plan has been approved for the pool of 12 bellwether cases in the NEC formula class action MDL. The discovery protocols permit each side to conduct depositions of case-specific factual witnesses and treating doctors in each of the 12 cases. Once this process is completed, 4 out of the 12 cases will be selected for the opening round of bellwether trials. A final pre-trial conference is currently set for March 11, 2024, at which time the initial trial date will be finalized.\n\nApril 1, 2023: Study From Emory University Suggest African-American Infants Are More Likely To Suffer From NEC\n\nA depressing but not surprising new study from Emory University suggests that African-American infants born prematurely are more likely to suffer from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and die from it than white infants. Our clients in the NEC litigation are disproportionately minorities, so the study confirms what we see on the ground.\n\nThis study underscores healthcare disparities and a lack of access to human donor milk in certain communities, which may increase the incidence of black preemie infants developing the disease from infant formula.\n\nJanuary 17, 2023: 97 Total Pending Cases In NEC MDL\n\nNine new infant formula NEC lawsuits were filed and transferred into the NEC class action MDL over the last month. There are now a total of 97 NEC formula lawsuits pending in the MDL. This number represents the total plaintiff population (other than those in state court) because there is no claim registry in this MDL.\n\nIs this even close to the total number of NEC baby formula lawsuits we can expect? No. Our firm has more than 97 NEC clients. But this litigation will be small. This may help plaintiffs get reasonable NEC lawsuit settlements. Why? Smaller litigation is less burdensome for the defendants, who can make reasonable settlement payouts without destroying the company\u2019s profitability. These defendants are making a fortune selling baby formula. There is plenty of money left over to pay fair settlement amounts to children who have suffered these awful injuries from NEC.\n\nJanuary 6, 2023: Judge Plans On Holding Science Day In NEC Class Action\n\nJudge Pallmeyer is planning to hold a \u201cscience day\u201d in the NEC infant formula class action lawsuit. Science days are common in complex mass torts. They give lawyers for both sides in the litigation the chance to make presentations aimed at educating the MDL judge on the scientific evidence and issues involved in the cases. Judge Pallmeyer is requiring the parties to provide potential dates for the NEC science day at the upcoming January status conference.\n\nNovember 11, 2022: Eight Cases Identified For Participation In Bellwether Program\n\nEight cases have already been identified for participation in the bellwether program in the infant formula NEC class action MDL. The defendants will pick four more cases to be included in this group by the end of the month. The MDL Judge recently issued an Order formally approving the fact sheet form that each of the plaintiffs in these 12 bellwether cases will be required to complete and submit. The fact sheet will be the first step in the bellwether discovery process. Depositions of witnesses and experts will follow.\n\nNovember 7, 2022: 29 Pending Cases Remanded To State Courts In PA\n\nThe judge in the NEC pre-term infant formula MDL granted a motion to remand 29 pending cases back down to state courts in Pennsylvania. The motion was granted because these claims involved claims against not just the formula manufacturers, but also the local hospitals that fed to the formula to the infants.\n\nThe presence of these local hospitals as defendants in the cases meant that the requirements for diversity jurisdiction in federal court were not met and, therefore, the cases were subject to remand. Following the removal of these 29 cases, there are now 106 pending cases in the NEC formula MDL.\n\nOctober 8, 2022: Bellwether Case Selection Process\n\nIn the NEC baby formula MDL, the judge has received a list of 66 potential NEC cases. From this list, the court will randomly select four cases to be included in the bellwether candidate pool.\n\nThis pool will consist of 12 cases in total: four chosen by the plaintiffs, four chosen by the defendants, and four randomly selected by the court. These 12 cases will then undergo fact discovery. Afterward, each side will select two cases from this group for bellwether test trials.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022: NEC Judge Issues First Significant CMO\n\nLast week, the Judge in the infant formula NEC class action MDL issued her first significant case management order. Amended CMO No.7 sets the rules and time frame for selecting bellwether test cases for discovery and trials. The first step will involve the selection of a pool of 12 \u201cbellwether discovery\u201d cases to serve as potential candidates for test trials. Why is this a big deal? You never get close to a settlement in litigation like this without the pressure of a trial date.\n\nThe plaintiffs, defendants, and the court each select 4 cases to comprise this initial pool of 12 and this process will be completed by November 23, 2022. So it is just months away. Once finalized, the 12 cases will then go through a brief fact discovery process so both sides can learn more about the cases. Once fact discovery wraps up, four cases will be selected from the pool of 12 and these 4 cases will be the initial bellwether trial cases. The bellwether trials will be scheduled 12 weeks apart and will alternate between defense pick and plaintiff pick.\n\nAugust 20, 2022: NEC Attorneys Propose Plan For Bellwether Candidate Pool\n\nAttorneys in the NEC baby formula MDL submitted a proposed plan for the selection of a pool of bellwether candidate cases. The plan to choose which cases go to trial first is similar to what mass tort lawyers typically see in other class action lawsuits\n\nUnder the draft order, the parties will provide the court with a list of 12 NEC lawsuits for the bellwether discovery pool, with even numbers of cases involving both Abbott and Mead Johnson.\n\nOnce the pool of 12 lawsuits is selected, they will go through pre-trial fact discovery. Once discovery is completed, both sides will get to select two initial bellwether trial cases for a total of four test trials.\n\nYou can guess how this works. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will pick the NEC lawsuits that have the best facts and are the most likely to win at trial and defense attorneys will pick the weakest cases that are most likely to lead to a defense verdict.\n\nJuly 27, 2022: New Study Underscores Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim for a Warning\n\nNEC remains one of the leading causes of death among premature infants, according to a new medical study recently published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The study concluded that premature babies diagnosed with NEC increased their chances of dying by a factor of 7. Even for those infants who survive NEC, however, the study found that a majority face permanent disabilities and prolonged medical care.\n\nJuly 19, 2022: New Guidelines From AAP\n\nAs concerns and lawsuits continue to grow around the link between NEC and bovine infant formula, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued new guidelines that recommend that parents avoid infant formula entirely for new babies. The new guidance urges hospitals to stop allowing the promotion of infant formula products and focus on emphasizing breastfeeding instead.\n\nMay 23, 2022: 52 Total Cases Active In NEC MDL\n\nThe Formula NEC MDL (In re: Abbott Laboratories, et al., Preterm Infant Nutrition Prod. Liab. Lit.\u2013 MDL No. 3026) is formally underway in the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer held her first status conference on May 19 and will make selections for the plaintiffs\u2019 Lead Counsel, Liaison Counsel, and leadership committee this week. As of May 16, a total of 52 active cases have been consolidated into the MDL. That number will likely triple over the next month.\n\nMay 4, 2022: NEC Lawsuits Move Forward\n\nThese lawsuits are moving forward. Our NEC baby formula lawyers are surprised by the number of parents we hear from every day interested in filing an NEC formula lawsuit. Our attorneys are finding that the most viable lawsuits are the ones where the child was born after 2011. The biggest problem our law firm is seeing with older claims is that finding the medical records can be a challenge. The more recent cases are also better because the warning argument that parents and doctors should have been told of the risks gets stronger every year after 1990. Still, our lawyers are reviewing necrotizing enterocolitis lawsuits as far back as 2001.\n\nApril 8, 2022: MDL Panel Certifies New MDL NEC Baby Formula Class Action Lawsuit\n\nThe MDL Panel has certified a new MDL NEC baby formula class action lawsuit. This means any NEC lawsuit filed in federal court will be transferred to Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, a U.S. District Court Judge in Illinois. This development will help push these lawsuits out of second gear, pushing us towards a trial date that may push Abbott and Mead to offer reasonable settlement amounts for an NEC formula lawsuit.\n\n\n\nApril 6, 2022: Illinois Supreme Court Grants Request To Consolidate About 20 NEC Formula Cases\n\nThe Supreme Court of Illinois previously granted a request to consolidate a group of about 20 NEC formula cases pending in Illinois state courts before a single judge (Dennis Ruth) in the Circuit Court for Madison County. This effectively created a mini-MDL at the state court level. Now, however, Abbott is seeking to have the consolidated cases transferred from Madison County to either Cook County (Chicago) or Lake County, under the doctrine of forum nonconveniens (inconvenient forum). The reason the Illinois lawsuits matter is because lawsuits filed in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, or any other state might well find their way to Illinois state court. So if you hire an NEC lawyer far away from Illinois, your baby formula lawsuit may end up in front of Judge Ruth in Madison County, Illinois.\n\nMarch 6, 2022: Public Gets Closer Look At Formula Manufacturers Following Similac Recall\n\nAfter the Similac recall debacle, Americans are getting a closer look at how baby formula manufacturers put profits ahead of people \u2013 and how the FDA is not built to keep these companies in check. This helps the NEC lawsuits because it shines a disturbing spotlight on how the sausage gets made and how federal regulators mind the store.\n\nFebruary 14, 2022: Enfamil Joins Abbott In Support Of Request For NEC Class Action\n\nLast week, the manufacturer of Enfamil (Mead Johnson) joined Abbott in support of the request for an NEC baby formula class action lawsuit for all NEC claims in federal court. This is a good development for plaintiffs who are hoping to avoid active litigation on their infant formula lawsuit. The big point of contention is which court will handle the MDL class action. The defendants want U.S. District Court in Connecticut. Why? Their motions did a poor job of explaining that. Baby formula lawyers for victims prefer the Northern District of Illinois for obvious reasons: both Mead and Abbott are headquartered near Chicago.\n\nFebruary 3, 2022: Possible State Court Class-Action In Illinois\n\nOur NEC lawyers are still waiting to see if there will also be a state court class-action lawsuit in Illinois. The Illinois Supreme Court has yet to rule. There may be two baby formula class actions pending in Illinois at one time: one in state court and the other in federal court. The formula defendants will likely consent to this class action just like they did the federal MDL.\n\nJanuary 27, 2022: Medical Literature Supports Plaintiffs\u2019 Contentions\n\nThe medical literature continues to support the contentions made by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the toxic infant formula NEC lawsuits. This new article underscores the risks associated with NEC and cow milk.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022: Abbott Files Petition To Consolidate NEC Lawsuits Into MDL\n\nAbbott filed a petition with the JPML requesting that all NEC infant formula lawsuits be consolidated into a new MDL. Abbott requested that the MDL be created in the District of Connecticut and assigned to Hon. Stefan Underwood.\n\nBaby Formulas Are Linked to NEC in Premature Babies\n\nBabies born prematurely require extra nutrition to boost their development and growth.\n\nMany premature infants, however, are not able to breastfeed feed. So they are generally given baby formula instead. Similac and Enfamil are the two leading brands of infant formula.\n\nFeeding Preterm Infants\n\nHistorically, there have been three primary types of nutrition for preterm babies: parenteral nutrition for feed intolerance (such as a feeding tube), human milk (either the mother\u2019s own milk or donor milk), and cow\u2019s milk-based formulas and fortifiers. Cow\u2019s milk-based products were once believed to be beneficial for the growth of premature, low-birth-weight babies.\n\nCow Milk Problem\n\nMost baby formulas, such as Similac and Enfamil, are made from cow milk with various nutrients and ingredients added to mimic human breast milk. While cow milk products were effective in quickly increasing the weight of these infants, recent scientific advancements have revealed strong links between cow\u2019s milk-based products and necrotizing enterocolitis, an undeniably serious condition that can cause death in preterm and severely preterm, low-weight infants.\n\nIn response to these recent and not-so-recent findings, alternative fortifiers derived from human milk and non-bovine-based products have been developed. Despite the established causal connection between cow\u2019s milk-based products and NEC, manufacturers, including the defendants, have not made significant changes to their products, packaging, guidelines, instructions, or warnings. They continue to promote and sell cow\u2019s milk-based versions, ignoring the potential harm to vulnerable preterm infants.\n\nWhile making tons of money, the manufacturers of these infant formulas have conveniently ignored the science over the last 30 years. That science shows that cow milk formulas cause bacterial septic overload in the stomach of premature babies that can cut holes in their bowels and cause bleeding and infection.\n\nNEC Treatment\n\nNEC can be mild in some infants and extremely serious in others. The first step in the treatment of NEC is to stop all oral feedings and begin the baby on an aggressive course of antibiotics.\n\nNutrients will then be administered intravenously. If the infection is not stopped quickly enough, it may leave dead tissue in the baby\u2019s intestines. If this occurs, surgery may be necessary to remove the dead intestinal tissue and repair any perforations.\n\nNEC Can Be Life-Threatening\n\nEven a mild case of NEC can be very dangerous and potentially life-threatening for a premature baby. Between 15-40% of premature infants with NEC die. The main reason for this is that NEC can lead to a fatal blood infection called sepsis.\n\nWhen NEC destroys the baby\u2019s intestinal tissue, it allows bacteria to leak out of the intestine into the abdominal cavity.\n\nThis type of infection is called peritonitis, and if not immediately and effectively treated, it will eventually allow the infection to enter the baby\u2019s bloodstream and become sepsis.\n\nVideo on NEC lawsuit settlement amounts\n\nNEC Consequences\n\nEven when NEC is not fatal, it can cause other long-term or permanent complications and adverse health consequences. One of every 3 babies with NEC will develop intestinal strictures.\n\nThis is a narrowing of the intestine. Intestinal strictures can make it difficult for food to pass through and may require surgery to correct. If NEC results in surgical removal of intestinal tissue, it can cause short bowel syndrome and impact the baby\u2019s development and growth.\n\nNEC in Premature Infants Caused by Enfamil or Similac\n\nNEC only occurs in 1 out of every 2,000 full-term live births in the U.S. In premature births, however, the condition is much more common. NEC occurs in about 10% of all premature babies (born 37 weeks or earlier).\n\nAlthough the exact cause of NEC is not fully understood, many scientific and clinical studies definitively prove that cow-milk-based infant formulas, such as Similac and Enfamil, significantly increase the risk of a premature infant developing NEC.\n\nBut the risk of Ninth premature babies has long been clear. For years, the American Academy of Pediatrics told us that human breast milk is the best path for preemies because of the risk of NEC from baby formula. Any newborn NEC baby formula lawsuit will focus on this medical literature and ask why Abbott and Mead did not give a warning.\n\nLancet Study\n\nIn 1990, a seminal study published in The Lancet by Dr. Alan Lucas and colleagues examined the relationship between infant feeding methods and the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. The multicenter study involved over 500 preterm infants with birth weights less than 1850 grams. The infants were randomly assigned to receive either human breast milk (from their mothers or donors) or standard bovine-based infant formula.\n\nThe researchers found a striking difference in the incidence of NEC between the two groups. Infants fed exclusively on formula were significantly more likely to develop NEC compared to those fed human milk. Specifically, the study reported that formula-fed babies were up to six to ten times more likely to develop NEC than those receiving breast milk. The protective effect of human milk was attributed to its unique components, such as immunoglobulins, growth factors, and anti-inflammatory agents, which are not present in bovine formula. This study was one of the first to suggest a strong link between bovine-based formulas and an increased risk of NEC, emphasizing the critical importance of human milk in the diet of preterm infants.\n\nJournal of Pediatrics Study\n\nApproximately ten years later, in 1999, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics by Dr. Richard Schanler and colleagues reinforced the findings of the earlier Lancet study. This research focused on extremely low birth weight infants and compared the outcomes of those fed with human breast milk (supplemented with human milk fortifiers) to those fed with preterm infant formula derived from bovine milk.\n\nThe study found that infants who received breast milk or human milk fortifiers were 90% less likely to develop NEC compared to those fed with traditional bovine-based formula. The data showed a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC among infants receiving human milk products, highlighting the protective role of human milk fortifiers when added to breast milk. These fortifiers provided the necessary nutrients to support the growth and development of preterm infants without the increased risk associated with bovine proteins.\n\nFurther strengthening these conclusions, two additional studies published in 2013 offered more definitive evidence on the link between NEC and bovine formulas. One of these studies, appearing in The Journal of Pediatrics, demonstrated that an exclusive human milk diet\u2014including human milk-based fortifiers\u2014significantly reduced the incidence of NEC and surgical NEC compared to diets that included bovine-based products. Another study published the same year corroborated these findings, showing that the use of bovine-based fortifiers increased the risk of NEC even when added to human milk.\n\nCollectively, these studies have had a profound impact on neonatal nutrition practices. They underscore the importance of providing human milk to preterm infants and have led to increased advocacy for the use of donor human milk and human milk-based fortifiers in neonatal intensive care units. The research has also played a critical role in the ongoing NEC baby formula litigation by providing scientific evidence of the risks associated with bovine-based infant formulas. Did the companies warn doctors and parents about these concerns? No.\n\nNew NEC British Medicine Study\n\nA study published on October 14, 2021, in the British Medical Journal, adds new fuel to any necrotizing enterocolitis formula lawsuit. The study suggests that the makers of infant formulas such as Similac and Enfamil have funded biased and unreliable clinical product trials. The researchers found that the infant formula trials showed a \u201cuniversal lack of transparency\u201d and may have downplayed the risks of NEC associated with their cow-milk formula products.\n\nMore NEC Formula Studies\n\nEvidence-Based Feeding Strategies Before and After the Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. July 2014). Here is the key quote: \u201cNecrotizing enterocolitis (N.E.C.) is a devastating disease of premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. It is well established that the risk is increased by the administration of infant formula.\u201d This will be a key study in any NEC baby formula lawsuit.\n\nAnother round of clinical study results was published in 2016 (Beyond Necrotizing Enterocolitis Prevention \u2013 Breastfeeding Medicine ) and 2017 (Human milk is the feeding strategy to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis \u2013 Semin Perinatol.). This language here is pretty unambiguous: \u201cExtremely premature infants who received an exclusive HUM [Human Milk] diet had a significantly lower incidence of NEC and mortality. The HUM group also had a reduction in late-onset sepsis, BPD, and ROP. This multicenter study further emphasizes the many benefits of an exclusive HUM diet, and demonstrates multiple improved outcomes after implementation of such a feeding protocol.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Cochrane (an independent healthcare research group) released the results of the most comprehensive study to date comparing health results for premature babies fed with bovine formula versus human milk. The results of the Cochrane study put to rest any lingering debate about the existence of a causal relationship between cow-milk-based formulas and NEC in premature infants. This study underscores the risk to babies with NEC.\n\nMakers of Similac and Enfamil Failed to Warn About the NEC Risks\n\nSimilac is manufactured and sold by Abbott Laboratories Inc., a large medical device and healthcare product company based in Illinois. You have likely heard of them. You are less likely to have heard of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, the company that makes Enfamil. But it is a 16 billion-dollar company.\n\nAbbott and Mead were well aware of the scientific evidence that their cow-milk-based formulas caused a significantly increased risk of NEC in premature infants. Despite being well aware of the link between their formulas and the risk of NEC, Abbott and Mead deliberately chose not to include a warning label about the NEC risk on their product labeling.\n\nChanging the warning for a baby formula under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not difficult. (It is a lot easier to change a warning under the FDCA than it is to change, for example, a warning on a drug.)\n\nSo why not add a warning? Well, let\u2019s start by saying our lawyers do not know yet. These toxic baby formula NEC lawsuits are just beginning. But, it is easy to make a prediction based on the facts already on the ground: follow the money. A warning will lead to fewer sales. Fewer sales lead to fewer profits and few yachts. We all know the story, right?\n\nFaced with growing scientific proof that their formulas presented an increased risk for premature infants to develop NEC, Mead and Abbott continue to market their products as safe and failed to warn consumers about this risk.\n\nNEC Lawsuits Against Baby Formula Makers\n\nA growing number of parents and preemies who were fed with Similac and Enfamil formula and subsequently developed NEC are filing product liability lawsuits against the formula manufacturers (Abbott and Mead) for negligent failure to warn.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Abbott and Mead had a duty to warn about the risks of NEC and their baby formula products but deliberately failed to include any such warning while continuing to market their products as safe.\n\nWhat Are Expected NEC Baby Formula Lawsuits Settlement Compensation Amounts? These NEC baby formula product liability lawsuits are new. But families have been filing medical malpractice lawsuits in necrotizing enterocolitis lawsuits for years. So the settlement compensation in these lawsuits, if successful, has a history that can guide us in determining possible settlement amounts in these lawsuits.\n\nThe average verdict in a successful NEC preemie lawsuit is in the millions of dollars. Our baby formula lawyers anticipate similar compensation payouts if plaintiffs win these trials.\n\nBut our lawyers do not expect to see Similac lawsuits or Enfamil lawsuits going to trial. We could be wrong. But our attorneys think the makers of these baby formulas will seek an out-of-court global settlement of as many NEC lawsuits as they can.\n\nBut settlement amounts and trial amounts are not the same things. So even if the makers of Similac and Enfamil predicted an average jury verdict compensation payout of $2 million per individual case, it would not mean the average settlement amount would be $2 million. Why? A settlement is a compromise.\n\nAre Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Baby Formula Lawsuit a Class Action Lawsuit? Yes, there is a class action NEC lawsuit pending in Illinois. This means that if you file in federal court in New York, Texas, California, or any other state, your NEC baby formula lawsuit be transferred to federal court in Illinois. But there are also cases pending in state court in states such as Missouri and Illinois.\n\nBut the infant formula claims may become a class action, albeit one that does not have thousands of plaintiffs. And while the size of the lawsuits could be smaller, the settlement amounts could be huge. Because the injuries are so extreme in many NEC cases, the average individual settlement compensation payout in the baby formula lawsuits could be extraordinary.\n\nExample NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit\n\nJust to give you some context, let\u2019s look at an example NEC lawsuit.\n\nLate last year, an NEC infant formula lawsuit was filed in the County Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois against Mead Johnson & Company LLC and Mead Nutrition Company, alleging negligence and other claims.\n\nThe complaint in this NEC lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s baby was born prematurely in 2013. Initially, the baby was \u201cdoing well\u201d on her mother\u2019s breast milk and was progressing normally. Two weeks after birth, the baby was fed Enfamil cow-milk-based formula for several days. The lawsuit claims that the formula caused the baby to develop NEC which required \u201caggressive medical intervention.\u201d\n\nSadly, the baby died a week later from complications related to the NEC. The complaint alleges failure to warn what we have been talking about. The lawsuit alleges Mead Johnson knew about the dangers of its bovine-based formula and failed to provide adequate warnings about the risk of NEC associated with the formula.\n\nWhy is this NEC baby formula lawsuit not barred by the statute of limitations given the child was born in 2013? I talk about this below.\n\nMini MDL NEC Class Action Lawsuit Sought in Illinois\n\nSince February 2021, 33 NEC baby formula lawsuits have filed been in Illinois state courts. Why is Illinois has become a hot spot for the emerging NEC formula litigation? The manufacturers of Enfamil and Similac are both headquartered in the Chicago area. So there is no federal court jurisdiction when Mead Johnson or Abbott are sued in Illinois.\n\nIn December 2021, NEC lawyers for the plaintiffs filed a motion with the Illinois Supreme Court asking that the separate cases be consolidated before a single judge. This procedure is the state court equivalent of an MDL class action.\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Abbott and Mead Johnson were granted extensions of time to respond to this request. Both companies will probably be in favor of consolidation since defending a single action will be more efficient than defending 30 separate cases at once.\n\nIllinois May Be NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit Epicenter\n\nThe creation of a state court MDL for NEC baby formula lawsuits in Illinois would indicate the rapidly growing momentum behind these cases. As more NEC infant formula lawsuits get filed in 2022, our attorneys expect a new infant formula MDL class action in federal court.\n\nBut maybe not. Illinois law is more advantageous to victims than most states. Illinois liberally allows lawyers from other jurisdictions to be admitted to work on lawsuits in that state. Mead and Abbott are both based in Illinois. So they cannot object to answering an NEC lawsuit in that jurisdiction. It may be that a large number of NEC baby formula lawsuits are filed in Illinois, even if they originated in Florida, Texas or any other state.\n\nIf this (mini) NEC baby formula class action lawsuit takes off, it will be an important development because it will push these lawsuits involving these milk fortifiers forward. This may force these companies to offer fair settlement amounts to resolve NEC-related injuries and deaths.\n\nWhat Is the Statute of Limitations for an NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit?\n\nThe statute of limitations to file an NEC lawsuit is a complicated question. The deadline to sue depends on the state where the harm occurred. There are often different statutes of limitations for the child \u2013 who might have a 21-year deadline to file \u2013 and the parents, who usually have a shorter deadline to file suit.\n\nAn NEC Lawsuit May Have Discovery Rule Statute of Limitations Extension\n\nThere is also arguably a discovery rule issue in the NEC lawsuits that could extend the statute of limitations even further. NEC lawsuits have alleged that because of misleading marketing and lack of adequate warnings of the risks of cow milk, parents did not know and could not have known of the link between NEC and baby formula from cow milk until just recently.\n\nBut there could be a short window to file a claim. So if you think you might want to bring a baby formula lawsuit, call an NEC formula lawyer today to fully understand your rights even if you do not have a present intention of filing an NEC lawsuit.\n\nSimilac vs. Enfamil: Is One Worse Than the Other?\n\nSimilac and Enfamil are the two leading brands of infant formula. When it comes to causing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature babies, it appears both Enfamil and Similac are equally bad. (The Similac recall from bad baby formula coming out of Michigan was not specific to NEC.)\n\nWhile future research may shed more light on whether Similac or Enfamil poses a greater threat, the consensus among healthcare professionals and legal experts remains clear: the primary risk factor for NEC in preemies is the use of cow\u2019s milk-based formulas, regardless of the brand.\n\nHow Will Mead\u2019s and Abbott\u2019s Lawyers Defend NEC Lawsuits?\n\nFirst, the defense attorneys will argue preemption. The gist of this argument is that premature infant formula claims under state law are not permitted by the Infant Formula Act (\u201cIFA\u201d) 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 350a. This is not a winning argument, and it has never been successfully made.\n\nIn a medical malpractice case involving NEC in 2021, one defense expert made this argument which I think you can expect to see from Mead and Abbott:\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claim that any provider \u2018caused\u2019 NEC is not supported by the literature. The cause of NEC is not understood at this time. Because there is no medically accepted single factor that causes NEC, no one can state within a reasonable degree of medical certainty what causes NEC.\n\nIn particular, it is impossible to know what caused the infant plaintiff to develop NEC. Even among exclusively human mild-feeding preterm infants, NEC can occur. The fact is NEC can neither be predicted nor prevented.\n\nThe main defense against developing NEC is avoiding preterm delivery; however, in this case, the pregnancy could not be extended because [the baby\u2019s mother] experienced a premature preterm rupture of membranes before she arrived at [the hospital.]\n\nFurther, the claim that the specific cause of NEC can be identified is rank speculation. Although NEC occurs most frequently in preterm infants, it occurs in term infants\n\nThis argument flies in the face of mountains of medical literature. I think the defense attorneys\u2019 arguments are so flawed in these cases I suspect the defendants will offer reasonable settlement amounts before any NEC lawsuit makes it to trial.\n\nHow Does NEC Cause Damage to the Intestine?\n\nNEC can cause severe damage to the intestine due to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply. Normally, the ductus arteriosus\u2014a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and aorta\u2014closes shortly after birth, redirecting blood flow so that the infant\u2019s organs, including the intestines, receive adequate oxygenated blood.\n\nWith children with NEC, the ductus arteriosus can remain open. This can cause a condition called Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). What happens is the failure to close causes critically need oxygenated blood to bypass critical organs like the intestines and return to the lungs. This misdirection can lead to pulmonary edema and a significant reduction in oxygenated blood supply to the intestines.\n\nOxygen deprivation of any kind causes having for newborns. In this situation, it in the intestines damages the lining of the bowel wall, making it more susceptible to bacterial infection and erosion. This problem is exacerbated in premature and low birth weight infants, who are often already in a tough spot with underdeveloped and vulnerable intestines.\n\nWhen these infants are fed cow\u2019s milk-based formula, the condition worsens rapidly, as the formula is not well-tolerated by their fragile systems. Both Similac and Enfamil products are derived, as we have been saying from cow\u2019s milk, which is not easily digested by the immature digestive systems of premature babies. The compromised intestinal lining becomes inflamed and, in severe cases, may develop perforations, allowing bacteria and stool to leak into the abdomen. This can cause life-threatening sepsis, a severe infection that can quickly lead to permanent injury or death.\n\nOne of the downside risks to the child is a condition known as short bowel syndrome. With this condition, the infant has reduced ability to absorb nutrients due to the loss of large portions of the intestine. Long-term complications can include chronic digestive issues, malnutrition, and neurological impairments.\n\nCall Our Lawyers About Your NEC Baby Formula Lawsuit\n\nOur law firm is currently investigating potential NEC toxic baby formula lawsuits.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Abbott Laboratories's (ABT, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-11, Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $86.55. It's currently trading at a price of $131.31. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -51.72%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $4.67 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 12.20%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 49.57 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 36.98 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 86.55\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $71.56. This valuation indicates that the Abbott Laboratories is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -83.5%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

The company recently reported that it has 14.97 million shares sold short, which is 0.87% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.07 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nAbbott Laboratories Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Abbott Laboratories has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Abbott Laboratories's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Abbott Laboratories's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.78%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

This has consequently resulted in increased investments aimed at discovering new antibiotics to combat this resistance. Moreover, pharmaceutical firms are currently working on the development of antibiotics: bacteriophage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.\n\nHigh Research and Development Costs\n\nDeveloping new antibiotics is costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of targeting bacteria without harming human cells. The research and development (R&D) process involves rigorous testing, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals, all of which increase expenses and time requirements. Moreover, there is a lack of financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies, as antibiotics typically offer lower returns on investment compared to more lucrative therapeutic areas like oncology or cardiovascular treatments. This discourages investment in antibiotic innovation, contributing to a limited pipeline of new drugs and exacerbating the global challenge of antibiotic resistance.\n\nGrowing Demand in Emerging Economies\n\nThe understanding of healthcare in the developing economies has advanced rapidly, creating a significant opportunity for the antibiotics market. Nations in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and various other parts of Asia are rapidly advancing; their healthcare systems are enhancing, and they are investing more in health services, consequently seeking more antibiotics. In these regions, infectious diseases have been increasing, and greater access to health care has contributed to market growth. Moreover, governments in these areas are increasingly focusing on the local manufacturing of pharmaceutical goods and the encouragement of regional antibiotic markets. Given the rising demand and the current push for local production and processing of goods, there is significant opportunity for both local and international pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\n\"Research made simple and affordable \u2013 Trusted Research Tailored just for you \u2013 IMR Knowledge Cluster\"\n\nhttps://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/\n\nGrowing Antibiotic Resistance\n\nIncreasing antibiotic resistance poses a significant challenge to the Antibiotics Market. As bacteria evolve and become resistant to existing antibiotics, the efficiency of these treatments contracts, leading to lengthier illnesses, advanced medical costs, and increased mortality rates. This issue complicates the development of new antibiotics, with the research and development pipeline struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of resistance. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human medicine and agriculture further worsen the problem. These factors create pressure on the market to innovate and find alternative solutions to combat resistant infections.\n\nKey Players to Watch:\n\nAbbott Laboratories (United States)\n\nAstellas Pharma (Japan)\n\nBayer (Germany)\n\nDaiichi Sankyo (Japan)\n\nEli Lilly (United States)\n\nGlaxoSmithKline (United Kingdom)\n\nJohnson & Johnson (United States)\n\nLupin (India)\n\nMerck & Co.

The premix formulation of Zosyn, indicated for treating multiple infections caused by susceptible bacteria, became available in Baxter\u2019s proprietary single-dose Galaxy containers. This launch aimed to enhance the delivery and accessibility of essential antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn May 2023, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of Xacduro (sulbactam for injection; durlobactam for injection) as a new treatment for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) caused by susceptible strains of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. The approval applies to patients aged 18 and older.\n\nDownload Sample 250 Pages of Antibiotics Market Report@ https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/request/18510\n\nKey Segments of Market Report \u2013\n\nBy Drug Class\n\nCephalosporin\n\nPenicillin\n\nFluoroquinolone\n\nMacrolides\n\nCarbapenems\n\nAminoglycosides\n\nSulfonamides\n\n7-ACA\n\nOthers\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Type\n\nBranded Antibiotics\n\nGeneric Antibiotics\n\nBy Action Mechanism\n\nCell Wall Synthesis Inhibitors\n\nProtein Synthesis Inhibitors\n\nDNA Synthesis Inhibitors\n\nRNA Synthesis Inhibitors\n\nMycolic Acid Inhibitors\n\nOthers\n\nBy Region:\n\nThe North America region dominated the antibiotics market due to efficient health care systems, substantial health care spending, and a widespread incidence of bacterial infections. Other well-established sectors encompass pharmaceuticals, and a solid legal framework is already established concerning bacterial antibiotic innovations. In 2023, North America accounted for roughly 35% of global antibiotic consumption market share. Increased incidences of hospital-acquired infections, growing worries about antibiotic utilization and resistances, along with the presence of leading pharmaceutical companies in the area, are among the elements that bolster the region. In addition, ongoing research and development of antibiotics to combat bacteria resistant to these medications will continue to propel the North American antibiotic market throughout the forecast period.\n\nIf you require any specific information that is not covered currently, we will provide the same as a part of the customization >> https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/custom-research/18510\n\nComprehensive Offerings:\n\nStrategic Points Covered in Table of Content of Antibiotic Market:\n\n1.

            "content": "Healthcare stocks have something to offer every investor. If you're looking for high growth, you can try an innovative biotech that may launch game-changing products down the road. If you're more of a cautious investor, you can aim for a well-established and diversified player that pays dividends and is known for steady earnings growth. Finally, investors looking for recovery stories also may find opportunity here; as pharma companies lose exclusivity on key products, they often reinvest in their pipelines or seize external opportunities, and this can lead to a new era of growth.\n\nIdeally, an investor would own one of each of these sorts of companies to maximize potential for gains and minimize risk. And right now, with only $200, you can get in on three such stories. They make great no-brainer buys today at their current prices and are excellent stocks to hold onto for the long term. Let's check them out.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nPfizer (PFE 1.54%) makes a great recovery-story buy today. The big pharma company saw annual revenue soar to a record $100 billion in earlier pandemic days, driven by demand for its COVID-19 products. But in more recent times, declines there have weighed on revenue, and investors also have worried about losses of exclusivity that concern older blockbusters.\n\nBut Pfizer has taken major steps to turn this around, cutting costs, acquiring and integrating oncology company Seagen, and investing in its own internal pipeline. The efforts are bearing fruit. In the recent earnings report, Pfizer reported double-digit quarterly revenue growth, said it was on track to deliver cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of the year, and reaffirmed its 2025 annual guidance.\n\nPfizer also said that in the past year it won more than a dozen product approvals and generated eight significant phase 3 trial readouts. This should translate into additional sources of revenue in the quarters to come. And Pfizer reported growth across the oncology products it gained through the Seagen acquisition.\n\nToday, trading for only 8 times forward earnings estimates, Pfizer is a no-brainer addition to any healthcare portfolio.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT 1.31%), thanks to its diversification across four businesses and its long dividend growth track record, adds security to your portfolio. The company operates in the following areas: diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals.\n\nI like this structure because, if one area faces headwinds, another area could compensate, and this limits negative impact on growth. (For example, in recent times, declines in coronavirus testing have weighed on the diagnostics business, but the medical devices business has been reporting double-digit revenue growth.) And overall, excluding the impact of coronavirus testing, fourth-quarter sales climbed 10% to $11 billion.\n\nYou also can count on Abbott for dividend payments. As a Dividend King, it's increased its annual payment for more than 50 consecutive years. This suggests rewarding shareholders is important to the company. This and the fact that Abbott delivers more than $6 billion in free cash flow suggest Abbott will stick with this policy.\n\nSo, this healthcare giant makes a fantastic investment for potential stock performance over time and for passive income along the way.\n\n3. Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX 7.71%) is a biotech company working on potential treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders. And what's attracted a lot of attention over the past year is Viking's weight-loss drug program. The company is developing VK2735 in injectable and oral formulations. The injectable is set to start a phase 3 trial in Q2, and the oral version recently entered a phase 2 trial.\n\nInvestors are excited about Viking's investigational drugs for two main reasons. First, they're in the same class as today's top-selling weight-loss drugs, so it's clear doctors and patients are interested in this sort of treatment. Big pharma rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have seen tremendous demand for their commercialized products. VK2735 is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, a type of drug that interacts with hormones involved in the digestive process. And second, Viking's candidate has generated promising results in trials so far, suggesting it could eventually carve out share in the market.\n\nViking stock soared last year when it first reported VK2735 results but since has given back a lot of those gains. Any positive trial news in the coming quarters and potential commercialization down the road could serve as major catalysts for share performance though. So now is a great time to get in on this high-potential stock.",

He said:\n\n\u201cThis market is not experiencing a small cap rally, it\u2019s experiencing a rally in everything else but the tech titans.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that many small-cap stocks were being bought indiscriminately through index funds like the Russell 2000, the S&P Small Cap 600, and the S&P Mid Cap 400.\n\n\u201cThe big institutions don\u2019t have time to examine all these different small-cap stocks, they just buy the index itself as an entity because it\u2019s still historically cheap, even after this rally.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the essence of the broadening\u2014some real treasures and some real trash getting scooped up together. He then explained:\n\n\u201cThe treasure being companies that do better when interest rates go down like when the Fed starts cutting.\u201d\n\nUnlike the cash-rich tech giants that don\u2019t need lower interest rates, small caps benefit tremendously from falling rates. That\u2019s why investors were selling their big-tech winners from earlier in the year and cycling into cheaper small-cap stocks.\n\nJim Cramer was particularly enthusiastic about this narrative back then and said that investors should \u201ccelebrate the market\u2019s good breadth\u201d.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 29, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 29th, 2024, market close to February 4th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from July 29, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The market has had some rough Mondays recently. First, DeepSeek news sank stocks on Jan. 27. AI-related stocks were especially hard hit. Then tariff news hit stocks Feb. 3 for another round of volatility. Ultimately the market has held its ground. Still, it was enough reason for us to look at some areas less affected by the two headlines. That's where Abbott Labs stock came in. Shifting attention to the medical space gave us a way to diversify while still sticking with solid leadership credentials.\n\nReducing Risk On Abbott Labs Stock\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) wasn't a standout stock of 2024. It spent most of the year in a long base without much progress. But it crossed its 50-day moving average line in January (1) and then a strong reaction to earnings (2) sent it soaring. After a host of upgrades and raised price targets, Abbott Labs found itself up nearly 15% in less than a week. Even as DeepSeek news shredded markets, Abbott Labs had a 3.5% gain (3).\n\nBut for swing trading purposes, it was too extended. A test of its 10-, 21- or 50-day moving averages would require buckling up for a 10% drop. That's an unacceptable amount of risk for swing trading. However, the stock retained the bulk of its gains and started trading fairly tight over the next week.\n\nThe next Monday, as tariff news roiled markets at the open, Abbott Labs showed a strong reversal from its lows and earned a spot on SwingTrader (4). How was it not extended when it was roughly the same price as the week before? The digestion gave the moving averages a chance to catch up. More importantly, the reversal gave a clear exit strategy with a low level of risk by using the entry day low. That dropped the risk from more than 10% to less than 2%.\n\nThat doesn't mean we weren't tested. The next day Abbott Labs dropped at the open, undercutting our stop by a penny and then recovering (5). It never traded down there for the rest of the day. One of our strategies at a weak open is to observe the first few minutes before reacting. If the low can't hold we'll exit. But if it quickly recovers, we can reassess to see if the damage was worth a reduction. In this case the strong recovery and support at the 10-day line and entry day low made it worth holding.\n\nTaking Profits While You Have Them\n\nGiven the extra volatility recently, it's made sense to be quick on the trigger to lock in profits. We trimmed our first quarter position at 1.4% and later the same day trimmed another quarter at 3% profit (6). Put in terms of the Average True Range (ATR), it was at 0.75 ATR for the first trim and 1.6 ATR for the second.\n\nIt might seem soon to be taking profits but by locking some in early you can often keep a trade green even if you get a subsequent drop. And that's what happened. The next day, Abbott Labs closed back below its entry (7). But before it did, we locked in a small profit on the remaining shares.\n\nEditor of \"Stock Trader's Almanac\" shares how he's looking at history to get a read on Trump 2.0 outlook\n\nThough it came back a little on Friday, it didn't make much of a recovery.\n\nThe end result is that we head into the weekend with the risk on the trade removed and the gains locked in. We can always buy it back if it sets up again.\n\nMore details on past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.

Despite February's decline in consumer sentiment, Yalof observes continued strong shopping activity. Yalof explains that consumers are still \"very present\" and showed \"great resilience\" during the fourth quarter despite economic challenges. He cites robust holiday season performance as evidence, noting that shoppers were \"definitely out and shopping.\" The outlet business model, he suggests, offers advantages during inflationary periods by providing competitive pricing. Yalof challenges the assumption that consumers are trading down to cheaper alternatives. \"They're not looking for ... sneakers at the cheapest price; they want Nikes at a great value price,\" he emphasizes, noting that today's consumer \"understands brand\" and prioritizes value over merely seeking the lowest price point. Watch the full interview above to hear Yalof explain how Tanger Outlets continues to focus on delivering quality and value, working to meet the needs of its core customer base while also attracting younger shoppers.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so\u2026 I want to help you find them.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently and 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter\u2019s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists.\n\nCramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump\u2019s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China\u2019s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion \"nonsense\" and \"idiocy.\" He added:\n\n\u201cNow, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they\u2019d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump\u2019s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Abbott Laboratories ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Abbott Laboratories has grown EPS by 25% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Abbott Laboratories maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.6% to US$42b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Abbott Laboratories' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can .\n\nAre Abbott Laboratories Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$223b company like Abbott Laboratories. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\n\nIs Abbott Laboratories Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Abbott Laboratories' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Abbott Laboratories' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. It is worth noting though that we have found that you need to take into consideration.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Holdings are subject to change.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind Its January Surge?\n\nIHI had a strong start to 2025, largely driven by impressive Q4 earnings from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), two of its top holdings. Together, these companies, which make up about 33% of the ETF\u2019s portfolio, drove its strong performance with impressive revenue growth and optimistic guidance.\n\nAbbott saw double-digit sales growth in its medical devices segment, fueled by the success of its FreeStyle Libre diabetes product, while Intuitive Surgical\u2019s 25% revenue surge was driven by higher procedure volumes and strong demand for its da Vinci robotic systems. Although both companies provided cautious guidance for Q1, analysts remain bullish on their long-term growth potential. With ABT and ISRG making up a significant portion of IHI\u2019s portfolio, their success contributed to the ETF\u2019s strong gains in January.\n\nQuick Fund Characteristics:\n\nPrice Per Share: $63.83\n\nAssets Under Management (AUM): $5.1 Billion\n\nDistribution Yield (TTM): 0.45%\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.40%\n\nPrice-to-Trailing-Earnings (PE) Ratio: 36.21x\n\nWho Are These ETFs For?\n\nIHI may be suitable for:\n\nHealthcare-Focused Investors\n\nGrowth-Oriented Investors\n\nDefensive Investors\n\nThe Final Word\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge healthcare advancements, IHI offers strong growth potential by focusing on leading medical device innovators, making it a compelling option to your portfolio.\n\nHappy investing!\n\nDISCLAMER\n\nThis newsletter is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a solicitation, offer, or recommendation to buy or sell securities, or as personalized investment advice.

Bacteria can then leak out from the holes and into the abdomen, which can cause severe infections and can even be fatal.\n\n\u201cThe only consistent observations made in infants who develop NEC are the presence of prematurity and formula feeding.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles\n\nNEC often develops within the first 2 weeks of life in a premature infant who is being fed with formula as opposed to breast milk.\n\nIn some cases of NEC, these feedings have occurred while the premature baby is still in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), leaving parents confused as to what may have caused their child's condition.\n\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis Complications\n\nSadly, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition that can often be fatal. The mortality rate for babies who develop NEC is estimated to be around 40%, making it the leading cause of overall infant mortality in the U.S., according to the NEC Society.\n\nAbout 50% of the infants who survive NEC will develop long-term health complications, according to the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD).\n\nSome of these health issues include:\n\nBrain injuries (like cerebral palsy or bleeding in the brain)\n\nHIE (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, a disorder that occurs when the brain doesn\u2019t receive enough oxygen for extended periods)\n\nSepsis\n\nShort bowel syndrome\n\nThe cost of treating NEC and the health complications it may cause can often be too much for many families \u2014 but you may be able to take legal action that could hold the formula manufacturer accountable and recover compensation for your child\u2019s treatment.\n\nIf your child suffered from any of these NEC health complications after being fed cow\u2019s milk-based infant formula, contact Sokolove Law today.\n\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Symptoms in Infants\n\nBecause of the high mortality rate for babies with NEC, it is very important to watch out for the signs of NEC and act quickly if you recognize them.\n\nSigns and symptoms of NEC in babies may include:\n\nBloating or swelling of the belly (abdominal distention)\n\nBloody stool\n\nDecreased activity (lethargy)\n\nGreenish-colored fluid (bile) in the stomach\n\nPoor tolerance of feeding (not being able to digest food)\n\nTemperature instability\n\nIf your infant is showing any of these NEC symptoms, consult a physician immediately.\n\nGet Help Pursuing Justice and Compensation for Your Child\n\nIf your child developed NEC after being fed Enfamil, Similac, or other cow\u2019s milk-based infant formulas, you may be able to take legal action on their behalf \u2014 and we may be able to help.\n\nAs a national product liability law firm, Sokolove Law has over 45 years of experience helping injured clients and their families pursue the justice and compensation they deserve.\n\nIn this time, we\u2019ve managed to secure over $9.8 Billion for thousands of families all across the country.\n\nGet a free case review or call (800) 995-1212 today to learn more about your legal options and how we may be able to help.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nHow Fast Is Abbott Laboratories Growing?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Abbott Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Abbott Laboratories remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 4.6% to US$42b. That's a real positive.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Abbott Laboratories' forecast profits?\n\nAre Abbott Laboratories Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Abbott Laboratories, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. We note that this amounts to 0.5% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Abbott Laboratories but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Abbott Laboratories's (NYSE:ABT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-04, Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $86.55. It's currently trading at a price of $128.45. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -48.41%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Abbott Laboratories\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Abbott Laboratories's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $4.67 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.58%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 12.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 49.57 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 36.98 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 86.55\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $71.56. This valuation indicates that the Abbott Laboratories is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -79.5%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nStory Continues",

As a result, the suit said the group prepared a large-scale pause in advertising.\n\nAccording to the suit, at least 18 advertisers that were part of GARM stopped buying ads on Twitter either in the U.S. or globally in the weeks after Musk bought the platform in November 2022, while other members of GARM \u201csubstantially reduced\u201d their ad spending on Twitter.\n\nIn turn, X claims it was deprived of billions of dollars in advertising revenue and the ramifications of the boycott continue to be felt years later, the suit alleged.\n\nLawyers for X argued that in a competitive market, social media platforms should have the option to set their own brand safety standards that are \u201coptimal for that platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interests of consumer,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nThe companies added to the lawsuit on Saturday did not immediately respond to NPR\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMusk has reshaped Twitter and its approach to what is and isn\u2019t permitted on the social media platform. He reinstated accounts that had been barred for violating the platform\u2019s rules. He also removed contract content moderators, the company\u2019s human rights team and investigators tasked with curbing political manipulation and child sexual abuse material, as NPR previously reported.\n\nLast year, following the suit, the World Federation of Advertisers discontinued GARM operations, explaining that \u201crecent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR",

Coca-Cola's brand inspires familiarity and a degree of trust among hundreds of millions of consumers around the world, and that's a powerful moat.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola's name is associated with soft drinks, the company has evolved with market demand. It offers a much more diversified portfolio of drinks than many realize, including almost everything from alcohol to sparkling water. Even within its lineup of soft drinks, the company offers a range of options to cater to consumers with health-related concerns. Wherever market demand lands next, Coca-Cola should be able to adapt.\n\nWe saw some evidence of the company's resilience during the early pandemic years, as sales of its products fell drastically amid government-imposed lockdown orders in many countries worldwide. However, Coca-Cola was able to navigate this headwind and has since rebounded.\n\nZooming out, we can see that Coca-Cola's financial results have been reliable and consistent for a long time:\n\nThe future should look much the same for the beverage giant, allowing it to maintain its solid dividend program. As a Dividend King, Coca-Cola has increased its payouts for 62 straight years. Its forward yield is now 3%, while the S&P 500's average is roughly 1.3%. Coca-Cola's dividend looks about as safe as they come.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott is best known for developing and marketing medical devices, some of which physicians use in critical lifesaving procedures. That grants the company an advantage since people don't stop needing medical care even in bad times -- at best, they can only postpone necessary surgeries. Abbott also operates across three other segments: nutrition, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe company has shown how adaptable its business is in recent years. First, the pandemic disrupted Abbott's medical device business, leading to many postponed surgeries and lower revenue from this segment. The healthcare giant turned to developing and marketing COVID-19 diagnostic products, which helped keep its revenue afloat. As the pandemic receded and the company encountered issues within its nutrition business, the medical devices segment was back on track, lifting the top line in the right direction.\n\nAbbott has several growth opportunities within its main business. None are more important than its diabetes care unit, spearheaded by the FreeStyle Libre franchise. This series of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which help diabetics keep track of their sugar levels, has been the company's biggest growth driver recently. However, as management pointed out last year, only 1% of adults with diabetes worldwide currently have access to CGM technology.\n\nAnother unit that should help with long-term growth is Abbott's cardiovascular devices, including its structural heart portfolio and products for addressing heart failure. As the world population ages, the devices it manufactures in these areas will be more in demand.\n\nBoth the company's business and its dividend program, then, look safe. Abbott Laboratories has increased its payouts for 52 consecutive years and currently offers a forward yield of 2%. Income-seeking investors can't go wrong with this stock.",

            "content": "Why X filed a lawsuit against these companies\n\nElon Musk-owned X has broadened its legal battle over an alleged collective advertising boycott , adding several prominent companies to its lawsuit. In a complaint filed recently in a Texas court, X named Nestl\u00e9, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell as defendants.These brands join a list that already includes the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), CVS Health, Mars, \u00d8rsted, and Twitch.X's lawsuit, initially filed in August last year, alleges a coordinated effort by these companies to boycott advertising on the platform following Elon Musk's acquisition in October 2022. At that time, Musk said in a post on X, \"Everyone who has been boycotted should file a lawsuit in every country they've been boycotted\".In a separate post, Musk said \"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.\"According to a report by Business Insider, the social media company claims that the defendants, some of whom were members of the now-defunct Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), conspired to \u201ccollectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue\u201d from X.Advertiser trade body WFA, in August last year, stated its intention to contest the suit, asserting its compliance with competition law.GARM, established in 2019, aimed to create standardised frameworks for categorizing harmful content, such as hate speech and misinformation. The participation was voluntary and many platforms adopted these frameworks as a \"brand safety floor.\" X itself was a former member of GARM.X's amended complaint alleges that the WFA \u201corganised an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards.\u201d The company claims that at least 18 GARM members ceased advertising on Twitter in the US and globally between November and December 2022, following Musk's $44 billion takeover in October.X argues that the alleged boycott diminished its competitiveness in the digital advertising market and negatively impacted user engagement.The company's ad revenue experienced a sharp decline after Musk's acquisition, as many advertisers withdrew from the platform due to staff reductions, policy changes, and the reinstatement of some of the previously banned accounts.",

The newest version of the lawsuit was filed Saturday as a proposed amended complaint.\n\nGARM, which focused on brand safety, shut down soon after X filed suit.\n\nEstablished in 2019 by the WFA, GARM's members included large brand advertisers and trade associations -- including the U.S.'s Association of National Advertisers, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Interactive Advertising Bureau, as well as big agencies such as Dentsu, GroupM, Havas Media, IPG, Omnicom Media Group and Publicis Media.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Federation of Advertisers previously said allegations that GARM engaged in anti-competitive behavior are baseless.\n\nThe spokesperson added that the organization created \u201cvoluntary industry standards on brand safety and suitability which media sellers and ad tech companies can voluntarily adopt, adapt or reject.\u201d\n\nX alleges that GARM was \u201cnot a mere standard-setting body,\u201d arguing in the complaint that the organization was able to force social platforms to change their business operations.\n\n\u201cBy forcing social media platforms to adopt and adhere to the GARM Brand Safety Standards, GARM-member advertisers and advertising agencies force social media platforms to incur certain costs previously borne by advertisers,\u201d X alleges in its complaint, brought in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\u201cBefore the Brand Safety Standards, each advertiser negotiated individually with social media platforms to customize the reach of its ads and to avoid unwanted content,\u201d X alleges, adding that some GARM members \u201cfound these individualized negotiations to be unsatisfying and costly.\u201d\n\nThe complaint continues: \u201cThrough the Brand Safety Standards, GARM-member advertisers collectively shift to social media platforms a portion of the costs previously borne by advertisers by forcing the social media platforms (i) to proactively remove certain content ... and (ii) to adopt tools to allow advertisers to more easily avoid certain other content subject.\u201d\n\nX sued three weeks after the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee issued a report accusing GARM of coordinating action by corporations, ad agencies and other industry groups in order to \u201cdemonetize platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other content deemed disfavored by GARM and its members.\u201d\n\nWhen the report came out, House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) -- who has repeatedly accused tech companies, Democrats and others of collaborating to suppress conservative voices online -- tweeted that GARM's strategy is \u201ca coordinated boycott against conservative outlets.\u201d",

The lawsuit was originally filed last year against the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), CVS, and video-streaming platform Twitch, accusing them of coordinating a large-scale pause in advertising following Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the WFA was concerned that X would deviate from the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), its brand safety initiative. The lawsuit alleges that at least 18 GARM-affiliated advertisers ceased buying ads on X either in the U.S. or globally in the weeks after Musk's takeover, while others significantly reduced their ad spend. X claims the boycott resulted in billions of dollars in lost advertising revenue, with lingering financial repercussions.\n\nLawyers for X argue that social media platforms should be able to establish their own brand safety standards rather than having them dictated by collective advertiser action. \"But collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interests of consumers,\" the complaint states.\n\nSince Musk assumed control, X has undergone significant changes, including reinstating previously banned accounts, cutting contract content moderators, and disbanding teams responsible for addressing human rights violations and political manipulation.\n\nFollowing the lawsuit's initial filing, the WFA announced it would discontinue GARM operations, citing \"recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities,\" which it said had caused financial strain and resource depletion.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.\n\nStory Continues",

He fired Twitter staff, cut content moderation and reinstated some previously banned accounts, including President Donald Trump's. All the while, X has had a contentious relationship with advertisers. Last year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino published an open letter to advertisers arguing ways the relationship has hurt the platform.\n\nReach Rachel Barber rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_",

Christopher Sadowski\n\nSome companies have been returning to X since Musk worked his way into President Trump\u2019s inner circle. Amazon, for instance, has been increasing its ad presence on the platfrom, according to the Journal.\n\nThe WFA has previously said that X\u2019s lawsuit misses the point of the organization and left it financially gutted.\n\n\u201cGARM is a small, not-for-profit initiative, and recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances,\u201d the group said after it disbanded GARM.",

As a result, the suit said the group prepared a large-scale pause in advertising.\n\nAccording to the suit, at least 18 advertisers that were part of GARM stopped buying ads on Twitter either in the U.S. or globally in the weeks after Musk bought the platform in November 2022, while other members of GARM \"substantially reduced\" their ad spending on Twitter.\n\nIn turn, X claims it was deprived of billions of dollars in advertising revenue and the ramifications of the boycott continue to be felt years later, the suit alleged.\n\nLawyers for X argued that in a competitive market, social media platforms should have the option to set their own brand safety standards that are \"optimal for that platform.\"\n\n\"But collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interests of consumer,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe companies added to the lawsuit on Saturday did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nMusk has reshaped Twitter and its approach to what is and isn't permitted on the social media platform.

He also removed contract content moderators, the company's human rights team and investigators tasked with curbing political manipulation and child sexual abuse material, as NPR previously reported.\n\nLast year, following the suit, the World Federation of Advertisers discontinued GARM operations, explaining that \"recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances.\"",

The trade body has previously said that it planned to contest the suit and that it was confident in its adherence to competition law.\n\nX, Nestl\u00e9, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, which were sent outside normal US business hours.\n\nFounded in 2019, GARM was a US-based initiative that aimed to provide common frameworks to be used by media owners, advertisers, and agencies to categorize harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, and online piracy.\n\nThe uptake of the frameworks was voluntary, and many online platforms and agencies adopted them as what became known as a \"brand safety floor\" \u2014 content that was deemed unsuitable for advertising to fund or appear next to. X was also previously a member of GARM.\n\nGARM discontinued operations after X filed its initial lawsuit, saying that, as a small nonprofit organization, it lacked the resources to fight it.\n\nIn its latest legal filing, X alleges that the WFA \"organized an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards to the satisfaction of GARM.\"\n\nThe complaint claims that at least 18 members of GARM stopped advertising on Twitter in the US or worldwide between November and December 2022. Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter closed in October of that year.\n\n\"As a result of the boycott, X became a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform,\" the complaint reads.\n\nTwitter's ad revenue plummeted following Musk's takeover of the company. Many advertisers shunned the platform after a number of sales and safety staff were let go and controversial banned accounts were allowed back on the site.\n\nX claims in the suit that GARM members \"collectively acted to enforce Twitter's adherence\" to its brand safety standards by boycotting the platform. The company is seeking \"trebled compensatory damages\" and injunctive relief for what it claims are violations of US antitrust laws.\n\nThe WFA, alcohol giant Diageo, and the ad agency holding company WPP are also facing a similar lawsuit from the video site Rumble, which alleges they collectively agreed to restrict advertising on social platforms, including Rumble. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is also investigating whether advertisers' and agencies' participation with GARM led to conservative media being demonetized.",

Now, as initially reported by Business Insider, an amended complaint has expanded the suit even further to include Nestl\u00e9, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the WFA \u201corganized an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards to the satisfaction of GARM.\u201d And it claims that these efforts succeeded in harming Twitter/X, with \u201cat least\u201d 18 GARM-affiliated advertisers stopping their purchase of ads on Twitter between November and December 2022, and other advertisers \u201csubstantially\u201d reducing their spending.\n\n\u201cThe majority of X\u2019s advertising revenue today comes from small- and medium-sized businesses that are not GARM members or clients of GARM-member advertising agencies,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cAs demand for advertising on X has declined as a result of the boycott, the price X\u2019s remaining advertisers are willing to pay has declined as well.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lawsuit claims that ad prices on X \u201cremain well below those charged by X\u2019s closest competitors in the social media advertising market,\u201d so \u201cby refraining from purchasing advertising from X, boycotting advertisers are forgoing a valuable opportunity to purchase low-priced advertising inventory on a platform with brand safety that meets or exceeds industry standards.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit isn\u2019t the only place where executives have offered a pessimistic assessment of X\u2019s business. The company\u2019s owner Elon Musk reportedly told employees in January that \u201cuser growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we\u2019re barely breaking even.\u201d",

            "content": "Many people set a goal to save $1 million for retirement. This amount may or may not be sufficient in today's economy, but it's at least a good start. And to get there, investing in stocks is an excellent strategy. Buying shares of the right companies -- those that can generate generous returns for decades -- will help significantly increase anyone's wealth. Which specific companies should one invest in?\n\nLet's consider two excellent options: AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie was once a division of the leading medical device company, Abbott Laboratories. The drugmaker started trading on the market in 2013, and since then, it has delivered market-beating returns.\n\nTrue, AbbVie's most important drug through most of those years, rheumatoid arthritis medicine Humira, is now out of patent exclusivity. However, the company is handling that loss just fine. Other therapies have managed to fill the massive hole Humira left behind, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq, two immunology medicines that significantly overlap with Humira's indications. According to management, these two superstars will continue to grow their sales into the next decade.\n\nThere are many other products AbbVie can count on, from migraine medicine Qulipta to its Botox franchise. And, of course, investors can expect the company to earn brand-new approvals, be it thanks to internally developed medicines or through acquisitions (which is how it got its Botox products). AbbVie's pipeline features several dozen ongoing clinical trials across many therapeutic areas.\n\nSo, the drugmaker's revenue and earnings will generally move in the right direction. They are doing so now, even after Humira's patent cliff. AbbVie can also significantly increase investors' wealth through its dividend program. Including the time it spent as a division of Abbott Laboratories, the company is a Dividend King and has raised its payouts for 52 consecutive years.\n\nSince it became a stand-alone company, AbbVie's dividend has increased by 310%. The company's forward yield is about 4%, while its cash payout ratio is conservative enough at just under 48% and leaves plenty of room for more increases. Those who opt to reinvest the dividend here will see significant improvements over what should already be strong returns. That's how AbbVie can help investors become millionaires in the next few decades.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nNovo Nordisk has been a pharmaceutical leader for decades. The company has made significant breakthroughs, particularly in diabetes, where it is a leader. Novo Nordisk is currently riding rapidly growing market for weight loss drugs. The drugmaker's famous medicine, Wegovy, is one of this space's best sellers. Novo Nordisk's work in this area has allowed it to generate strong revenue and earnings in recent years.\n\nIt is developing several more that could earn approval within the next few years. Further, semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic (a diabetes medicine), is still undergoing clinical trials for potential billion-dollar indications. They include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and Alzheimer's disease. Both of these areas have high unmet needs.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved just the first MASH treatment last year, although some 22 million patients in the U.S. live with the disease (including 9 million with clinically significant liver disease), according to some estimates.\n\nAnd while Alzheimer's affects about 7 million people in the U.S., very few medicines for the condition have earned the green light in the past two decades. Novo Nordisk's work here could lead to key label expansions. The company's pipeline also features investigational therapies across many other areas, from its core expertise of diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Novo Nordisk has succeeded in delivering superior returns for a long time thanks to its innovative qualities.\n\nThere is more where that came from: The pharmaceutical leader can still post above-average returns and help investors reach the coveted $1 million mark.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

According to a report by Patience Haggin of The Wall Street Journal, X has added Nestl\u00e9, Colgate-Palmolive, Shell, Abbott Laboratories, Lego, Pinterest, and Tyson Foods as defendants in its ongoing lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Texas, alleges that these companies, along with the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), violated antitrust laws by conspiring to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising from X. The WFA, which previously dismissed the lawsuit\u2019s claims as a misrepresentation of its responsible media efforts, has yet to comment on the latest developments.\n\nX originally filed the lawsuit in August 2024, targeting companies such as Mars, CVS Health, Orsted, and Twitch. The platform\u2019s legal action comes after Musk took over Twitter in 2022, pledging to relax content moderation policies in the name of free speech. His approach sparked widespread advertiser concerns, leading to a significant drop in X\u2019s ad revenue.\n\nAs Musk\u2019s political influence has grown, some companies have reconsidered their stance on advertising with X. The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon, which had previously pulled its ads, is now increasing its spending on the platform. However, tensions remain high between Musk and major advertisers. In November 2023, Musk made headlines when he told brands that had withdrawn from X to \"go f\u2014 yourself.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also references the role of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), an initiative of the WFA, which reportedly raised concerns about Twitter\u2019s compliance with brand safety standards in 2022. X claims this action triggered a massive advertiser boycott. Shortly after X first filed its lawsuit, the WFA shut down GARM.",

The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies. However, the capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic\u2013aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues",

Born in Dothan, AL as part of a military family, he spent the first years of his life in Japan, where Japanese became his first language. Moving often, and living years in the Phillipines as well as several American army bases, instilled a life-long love of travel, learning about other cultures and meeting new people. Dick was a graduate of Newberry High School, and a 1974 graduate of The Citadel where he served as \u201cA\u201d Company Commander. He served 5 years active duty in the United States Army: at Fort Knox, KY, South Korea's DMZ, and Germany ( then West Germany). After being honorably discharged, Dick spent his career in medical diagnostic equipment sales, being part of the first team of Abbott Laboratories Diagnostic Division sales force. While with Abbott he received numerous awards and citations for meeting and exceeding sales quotas and became District Manager of the Houston, TX District. He ended his sales career with Abaxis Medical Diagnostics for which he traveled extensively. After moving to Newberry, he and his wife spent several years restoring the historic Coateswood House. He was a member of Aveleigh Presbyterian Church and the Newberry Cotillion Club, where he served as President. He retired early and pursued his lifelong passion for travel with several Mediterranean cruises , trips to explore European capitals, and numerous Caribbean cruises . His most meaningful cruise was of the coast of Western Europe which included a trip to Normandy, France. It was here he was able to observe first hand the site of the invasion of Omaha Beach, the memorial to a generation of America's sacrifice, and the row upon row of crosses marking the graves of American war dead. This for him captured his deeply held belief in duty, honor, and service for country, which was his heart.\n\nDick is survived by his wife of 35 years, Cile Purcell Hursey; a brother, William Randolph \u201cRandy\u201d Hursey and his wife, Susan of Tryon, NC; a niece, Jill Hursey Hicks and her husband, Jim and their daughter, Sophie; a brother-in-law, Trent Keitt Purcell and his wife, Vonnie; a sister-in-law, Julie Purcell Thompson and her husband, Jerry; nephew, T.K.

Jason Edwards. Burial will follow in Rosemont Cemetery.\n\nMemorials may be made to the Citadel Development Foundation, 171 Moultrie Street, Charleston, SC 29409.\n\nActive pallbearers will be Ronnie Byrd, Sam Hart, Eddie Longshore, Mac Montgomery, Ned Purcell and T.K.

Key findings from the study, with data from 143 participants at the four-year mark, include:\n\nStrong preference and lasting relief\u201491% of patients preferred BurstDR stimulation therapy over traditional tonic stimulation, with sustained improvements in pain, sleep and daily function\n\nImproved mental and physical health\u201445% reduction in pain catastrophising, reaching levels comparable to those without chronic pain, as well as significant improvements in sleep and physical function\n\nHigh-level of safety and patient satisfaction\u2014low rates of adverse events over the study period, with 85% of patients willing to do the procedure again\n\nAbbott also recently announced that its NeuroSphere digital health app will launch a unified patient platform for US patients. According to the company, this new app builds on current connected care patient support capabilities to encompass the whole care journey\u2014from early education to post-implant follow-up. As part of this extended remote support system, the digital health app will introduce a live assistance feature, which allows patients to request support from Abbott\u2019s patient education team when they have questions about their device.\n\nThe new, streamlined app will be available via the Abbott-provided patient controller or personal iOS mobile devices, and incorporates the award-winning NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, giving users the flexibility and comfort of receiving care from their doctor wherever they are through a secure, in-app video chat and integrated remote programming feature, the company further claims.\n\n\u201cChronic pain is a deeply personal and unique experience, requiring equally individualised treatment options,\u201d said Pedro Malha, Abbott\u2019s vice president of neuromodulation. \u201cEvery spinal cord stimulation advancement we develop\u2014from BurstDR to the NeuroSphere digital health app\u2014is designed to meet people where they are in their chronic pain journey and help them regain their lives. The pain relief and satisfaction our technologies have brought to people reinforce how Abbott is redefining the way advanced diseases are managed, and breaking down barriers to care globally.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "New Delhi, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global neurostimulation devices market was valued at US$ 9.84 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 22.64 billion by 2033 from, growing at a CAGR of 9.7% during the forecast period 2025\u20132033.\n\nNeurostimulation devices continue to attract significant attention in 2024 by transforming how clinicians address chronic pain, movement disorders, depression, and other neurological conditions. Spinal cord stimulators have become a cornerstone for severe back and leg pain management, with one advanced model from Abbott introduced in 2024 providing 10 distinct waveforms for personalized pain relief. Deep brain stimulators are equally prominent, such as a Medtronic system that weighs about 48 grams, offering increased comfort for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Transcranial magnetic stimulators have also expanded into outpatient clinics, and a high-end model from Magstim Company cools its coils in less than 7 minutes to ensure back-to-back sessions.\n\nDownload Free Sample Pages @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/neurostimulation-device-market\n\nLeading players in the neurostimulation devices market include Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott, LivaNova, NEVRO, and BrainsWay. The Infinity DBS system from Abbott integrates directional leads with 8 contact points for essential tremor, while Boston Scientific\u2019s WaveWriter Alpha SCS supplies 9 tailored modes to alleviate neuropathic symptoms. BrainsWay has driven mental health applications forward by introducing a deep TMS helmet in 2023 featuring 3 separate coil designs for treatment-resistant depression. Vagus nerve stimulation remains a powerful avenue for epilepsy intervention, with LivaNova\u2019s therapy detecting abnormal heart rate spikes within 10 seconds to deliver an automatic rescue dose. These devices are increasingly sought by hospitals, neurology centers, outpatient pain clinics, and mental health facilities requiring more targeted, device-assisted interventions.\n\nRecent developments show a clear pivot toward miniaturization, tailor-made programming, and extended battery life. NEVRO\u2019s HF10 therapy runs at 10 kHz and maintains stable outcomes for chronic trunk pain over more than 2 years of continuous monitoring. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health granted approval in early 2024 to a sacral nerve modulation device from Medtronic, underscoring broad global expansion in implantable neurostimulation approaches. A neurology research center in Cleveland advanced individualized electrode placements through 6 separate clinical trials initiated in 2024 for spinal cord injury patients.

            "content": "Despite an already strong run, AngioDynamics, Inc. ( ) shares have been powering on, with a gain of 38% in the last thirty days. The annual gain comes to 111% following the latest surge, making investors sit up and take notice.\n\nEven after such a large jump in price, AngioDynamics' price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 1.8x might still make it look like a buy right now compared to the Medical Equipment industry in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/S ratios above 3.6x and even P/S above 8x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.\n\nWhat Does AngioDynamics' Recent Performance Look Like?\n\nAngioDynamics hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining revenue compares poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth in their revenues on average. Perhaps the P/S remains low as investors think the prospects of strong revenue growth aren't on the horizon. So while you could say the stock is cheap, investors will be looking for improvement before they see it as good value.\n\nDo Revenue Forecasts Match The Low P/S Ratio?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nIn order to justify its P/S ratio, AngioDynamics would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the industry.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 13% decrease to the company's top line. As a result, revenue from three years ago have also fallen 5.5% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 6.1% each year over the next three years. With the industry predicted to deliver 9.4% growth each year, the company is positioned for a weaker revenue result.\n\nWith this in consideration, its clear as to why AngioDynamics' P/S is falling short industry peers. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nDespite AngioDynamics' share price climbing recently, its P/S still lags most other companies. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\n\nAs expected, our analysis of AngioDynamics' analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find that you need to be mindful of.\n\nIf you're unsure about the strength of AngioDynamics' business, why not explore for some other companies you may have missed.\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\n\nRecent times have been advantageous for Siemens Healthineers as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For Siemens Healthineers?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Siemens Healthineers' to be considered reasonable.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 29% gain to the company's bottom line. As a result, it also grew EPS by 10% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 16% growth each year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that Siemens Healthineers' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Siemens Healthineers' P/E\n\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that Siemens Healthineers currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.\n\nYou always need to take note of risks, for example - we think you should be aware of.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the S&P's best eight-session rally since August. As most stock market gains by then had been due to mega-cap stocks, Cramer shared that \"I do like to see that this is a rally that's not led by\" either Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock that tumbled by 15% on Monday or by the firm responsible for designing the iPhone.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer was happy that stocks were instead being led higher by sectors that had underperformed lately. One of these is healthcare, and the CNBC host shared his excitement by sharing \"Or how about the drugs? How about the drugs!\" He added \"I mean last week I was at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. And no one liked the drugs! They exploded yesterday!\"\n\nYet, even though the 'drugs were exploding,' Cramer also mentioned other sectors that were having bull markets. According to him \"So what I'm saying is that, many bull markets each day. Banks had a bull market. Drugs had a bull market. Rails had a bull market. I think I love it! . . .This is what I want! Not broad on one day, but broad over time.\"\n\nAs to the reason behind his optimism, Cramer outlined \"I just don't want it to be the same old, same old!\" He was irate over market and media sentiment indicating that multiples of the Magnificent 7 stocks were overstretched. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared \"Like yesterday there was a piece in the FT, I like the FT. But they were talking about how you know, now things are really stretched.\" He believes that the argument that the multiples are overstretched doesn't explain the S&P's rally as \"It's not a Mag 7 rally for heaven's sake. It's not!\"\n\nCramer added, \"Well I just think this is one of those markets where when you have a good quarter, bingo.\" When co-host David Faber asked him why he believed that non-tech sectors were driving the market since technology stocks had done well until that point, Cramer replied and stated \"I'm saying, this particular jaunt is not led by the usual suspects. I said all that stuff.\" He added \"But what I'm saying is that there are other stocks besides tech. That's all I'm saying. And that yesterday was about healthcare. It was about healthcare and it hasn't been about healthcare for a long time. The healthcare stocks, the HMOs were terrific.\"\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Breaks Silence On DeepSeek AI Sell-Off & Discusses These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off.\n\nOn the day that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock bled 17% in the wake of investors panicking about Chinese AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s low development costs for AI, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the topic. Cramer has been one of the biggest fans of the GPU company, and right off the bat, he started out by sharing that the key thing to consider now is whether the GPU orders for the firm will materialize.\n\nHe also commented on \u2018traveler stocks\u2019 or those that have benefited from the broad AI sentiment. Cramer shared \u201cWhat I find most interesting is that, the fellow travelers to these are the nuclear stocks that have been up a lot. . . .Are the memes. Are the crypto.\u201d He commented that the fact that these stocks were all simultaneously losing value was not great for the market. According to Cramer, \u201cSo looks [like] they are all you know one stock and that is not good. That\u2019s not good because that says you have hype and froth in here that has to come out no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his experience using DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model. In his previous remarks, Cramer revealed that he was a fan of ChatGPT and had used OpenAI\u2019s product to research stocks ahead of his appearances on CNBC. However, he wasn\u2019t impressed by R-1. Cramer outlined that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of R-1 that left him unimpressed was censorship. \u201cThis is a Chinese product,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo when I put into my very helpful DeepSeek, what famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank? And it initially says, the famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he added. While this is all good, soon after the initial response, R-1 \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope,\u201d according to him.\n\nWhen co-host Carl Quintanilla asked him whether it was worth buying any of the AI stocks, Cramer was rather direct. He shared \u201cI don\u2019t have the knowledge to be able to make that decision. It\u2019s better to own that.\u201d Cramer also noted that before Monday\u2019s appearance, there was a debate about whether \u201ccan we just make a determination, or is the determination that we don\u2019t want to let anybody down so we can\u2019t make that?\u201d Given the absolute bloodbath in the premarket that day, he felt \u201clike, whatever you do, maybe twisted between now and the opening.\u201d As a result, Cramer shared \u201cBut sometimes you have to admit, like if you were at the hedge fund you\u2019d just say, you know I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s not a cop-out. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\n\nHowever, with respect to the doubt surrounding AI, he added \u201cWhen in doubt do you go against Zuckerberg? Do you go against Ellison? And I come back and say, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s better to say I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLike social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s AI, DeepSeek is also open source. When asked about whether being open source threatens the ecosystem, Cramer replied \u201cYeah I know that, again, I don\u2019t want to front row Mark Zuckerberg on what he\u2019s saying, but I would say that we do have tremendous chip allocation problems here. And I know that David, we, if you have open source, would you think, that you do not need as many chips. Right. Not necessarily.\u201d\n\nThe sell-off in tech stocks did make him feel that \u201cit\u2019s not such a bad idea to look away from one moment and go back and say the healthcare rotation was so powerful last week.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a global healthcare giant whose medical device business is driving its narrative. The firm\u2019s glucose monitors have helped it navigate a tumultuous 2024 where it struggled from a slowdown in China and an infant formula lawsuit. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) glucose monitors have left Cramer impressed as he believes that the market is underappreciating the firm\u2019s potential to make an impact in the diabetes market. In his latest remarks, Cramer wondered how much hot money was in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock at a time when tech was crashing:\n\n\u201cWell look at Abbott Labs then. Oh my god. Are you serious? Was there that much hot money in that?\u201d\n\nOverall, ABT ranks 10th on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "There were unforgiveable shortcomings in management, which included critical information not reaching senior officials as well as a lack of good old-fashioned common sense.\n\nThe crisis is long over, but if you were a young family with babies three years ago, scary memories of escalating health worries and retail stores bereft of infant formulas remain. Moms shared horrifying social media images of their babies covered in rashes after being forced to use the only (inferior) formula they could find.\n\nCredit: TikTok\n\nThree years post-crisis, the overriding problem remains. As Fast Company has written:\n\nWe still don\u2019t have a resilient or diverse domestic supply, and the government has failed to make any significant progress to prevent a future crisis. We are still just one bacterium away from entering another tailspin due, in large part, to our inability to address the U.S. market failures.\n\nWhat happened, and why?\n\nAn audit released by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the parent organization of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is not a pleasant read.\n\nLet us turn back the clock to February 2022. Numerous consumers complained about infants\u2019 illnesses, which the FDA was able to link to the bacterium Cronobacter sakazakii. Several infants were hospitalized and two died after drinking powdered formula made at Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Sturgis, Michigan facility. Abbott initiated a recall as part of a larger voluntary action covering Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare.\n\nThe dominant player in the U.S. infant formula market, Abbott controls about 40% of the market share, with the Sturgis facility alone contributing 40% of the company\u2019s total U.S. formula production. Given that more than 3.5 million babies are born in the United States each year, with many relying on formula as a sole or primary nutrition source, the recall\u2019s impact was profound and prolonged, prompting widespread concern among consumers and Congress.\n\nShelves empty of formula, spring 2022\n\nDelayed actions, inefficiencies and communication failures\n\nDespite receiving reports of problems and whistleblower complaints about safety issues at the Sturgis facility, the FDA\u2019s response was alarmingly slow. In February 2021 \u2014 a full year before the FDA issued a public warning \u2014 the agency archived a whistleblower complaint instead of forwarding it for investigation, ostensibly due to the fact that the oversight position at the head of the whistleblower complaints division at the National Consumer Complaint Coordinator (NCCC) had been vacant from January 2020 to July 2021.\n\nThat October, another whistleblower complaint was sent to multiple senior FDA officials but, due to unreliable policies for escalating such complaints, senior leadership did not receive it until four months later. This delay was attributed to glitches in the FDA mailroom and the absence of a systematic procedure for escalating serious complaints. The former Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response admitted during a congressional hearing that these complaints should have been forwarded up the chain of command much more rapidly.\n\nInefficiencies in the FDA\u2019s inspection procedures further compounded the issue. During a subsequent inspection at Abbott\u2019s Sturgis facility in September 2021, a new consumer complaint related to a Cronobacter infection was filed but not communicated to the inspection team.\n\nThe FDA had no process in place to record and track critical information, which blocks even conscientious investigators from finding out about new complaints during ongoing inspections. Moreover, the FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting structure lagged those of other countries.\n\nAgency policies lacked clarity on which complaints should be communicated to the National Consumer Complaint Coordinator, which resulted in critical reports being mishandled or ignored. For example, some adverse event reports were not forwarded due to alleged resource constraints or misjudgment of the reports\u2019 seriousness, further delaying necessary actions.\n\nIt is disgraceful that so many aspects of an important public health problem were allowed to fall through the cracks. The FDA isn\u2019t some startup experiencing growing pains; it has been around since 1906.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many FDA activities, including inspections deemed mission-critical. The inspection at the Abbott facility, for example, was not conducted until 102 days after the whistleblower complaint was received. This delay was partly due to a pandemic outbreak at the facility and the absence of clear guidelines on how to promptly initiate inspections during public health emergencies. Had the FDA acted sooner, the complaint would likely have identified and addressed the issues at the facility earlier.\n\nProduct recalls: Revamped authority and a need for clearer guidelines\n\nThe FDA\u2019s authority to mandate recalls also faced scrutiny in the Inspector General\u2019s audit. The Agency did not have specific policies for initiating FDA-required recalls for infant formula, despite having the authority to do so under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In addition, manufacturers are not required to notify the FDA of positive pathogen test results for undistributed infant formula, which limits the FDA\u2019s ability to address potential health risks preemptively.\n\nDuring the audit, it also was revealed that Abbott had identified three positive tests for Cronobacter in finished products that were not distributed. The agency claims it only became aware of these results during subsequent inspections, a significant gap in proactive risk management. If manufacturers were required to report such findings, regulators, clinicians and others could better assess and mitigate risks at production facilities and anticipate impending shortages.\n\nThe audit of the FDA\u2019s handling of the Abbott infant formula recall uncovered multiple deficiencies in policies and procedures that compromised the agency\u2019s ability to safeguard the infant formula supply chain. Delays in responding to whistleblower complaints, inadequate communication of consumer complaints, lack of timely mission-critical inspections, and insufficient recall authority all contributed to a delayed and ineffective response.\n\nTo prevent future crises and ensure the safety of infant formula, the FDA should overhaul its policies and procedures. This would include the writing of clearer guidelines for the timely initiation of inspections; improving protocols to ensure the accuracy of data; streamlining the process for acting on whistleblower complaints; and mandating the reporting of positive pathogen test results for all infant formula products, distributed or not.\n\nThis Abbott recall fiasco reminds us of the critical role that regulatory oversight plays in a public health crisis. It is also a reminder that FDA staff often fall short not only in efficiency but also in common sense.\n\nAs a 15-year veteran of the FDA, where I served in a variety of capacities, including Special Assistant to the Commissioner (agency head) and the founding director of the Office of Biotechnology, I find some of its actions to be particularly inappropriate and vexing.\n\nFor example, several years ago, the FDA sent a formal Warning Letter to a Massachusetts bakery for including \u201clove\u201d in its ingredient list. It said:\n\n\"Love\" is not a common or usual name of an ingredient, and is considered to be intervening material because it is not part of the common or usual name of the ingredient.\n\nSilly and perhaps not that big of a deal one might think, but an \u2018FDA Warning Letter\u2019 is a significant regulatory sanction that would have on it the fingerprints of numerous bureaucrats \u2013 bureaucrats responsible for food safety and regulatory compliance who could otherwise have been focusing on legitimate concerns.\n\nEnsuring the safety of infant formula is not just about regulatory compliance; it is about protecting the most vulnerable members of society, and is only one example of numerous systematic problems at the Agency. To regain public trust in its ability to safeguard the nation\u2019s food supply, the FDA must expeditiously implement needed reforms.\n\nNote: A version of this article was previously published by the Genetic Literacy Project.",

Its innovative design incorporates enhanced markers, which assist interventionists in implanting the valve with greater precision and provide improved visibility during the procedure, the company announced.TAVI, a groundbreaking, minimally invasive procedure, allows for the replacement of a damaged aortic valve through small incisions, often in the groin. This approach reduces recovery time and lowers risks compared to traditional open-heart surgery, the statement added.Speaking about the launch, Neeraj Singh from Abbott\u2019s structural heart division in India, said, \u201cTAVI serves as a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement, reducing symptoms and improving life expectancy for patients. Abbott\u2019s Navitor Vision valve is a significant addition to our portfolio for structural heart treatments , particularly for heart valve diseases, offering hope to patients who may have limited treatment options.\u201dAortic stenosis, a severe and life-threatening condition, occurs when the aortic valve narrows, restricting blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. If left untreated, it can lead to heart failure, impaired quality of life, and, in some cases, sudden cardiac death.By bringing the Navitor Vision to India, Abbott aims to improve outcomes for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis while expanding access to innovative, life-saving technologies.",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

            "content": "This medtech giant is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence for a strong growth outlook.\n\nShares of Medtronic (MDT 2.27%) are off to a fantastic start in 2025, already rising by 13% year to date. The medical devices giant had some weakness in recent years amid disappointing trends from its diabetes segment, but it appears to have finally turned the corner with its increasingly diversified operating profile.\n\nMedtronic is capturing demand for its cutting-edge solutions, as recent product launches emerge to drive new growth. With the stock still trading at 26% below its 2021 peak, there's a sense that the current rally is just beginning. Here are three reasons Medtronic stock may make a great addition to your portfolio right now.\n\n1. Leadership in AI-powered medtech\n\nMedtronic is renowned for revolutionizing healthcare through groundbreaking innovations, from pioneering the first implantable cardiac pacemakers to developing state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical tools. Through its four core operating segments -- cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical-surgical, and diabetes care -- the company continues to cement its position as a global leader in medical technologies.\n\nWhat's particularly exciting in 2025 is Medtronic's embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities across its portfolio. The company is integrating machine learning and automation into several different applications. The GI Genius intelligent endoscopy module stands out as a prime example, revolutionizing colonoscopy procedures with AI-powered polyp detection.\n\nIn the surgical space, the Aible robotic surgery ecosystem leverages predictive models to develop customized patient treatment plans for complex spine and cranial procedures. And in the highly competitive diabetes care segment, the new MiniMed 780G insulin pump system employs AI algorithms to predict and automatically adjust insulin delivery based on real-time blood sugar monitoring.\n\nUltimately, these AI-enhanced features are intended to improve patient care and deliver superior medical outcomes while helping to consolidate Medtronic's market share in its key segments. Their impact was evident in the company's results for its fiscal 2025's second quarter (which ended Oct. 25). Revenue climbed 5.3% year over year, propelling an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS).\n\nBeyond those otherwise modest headline numbers, perhaps the bigger story is the operating outlook. Over the past year, Medtronic has secured more than 120 regulatory approvals globally for new products, many of which are just starting to gain commercial adoption. The pipeline suggests a runway for even stronger trends.\n\n2. Improving earnings momentum\n\nThere's a lot to like about Medtronic, which is well-positioned to capitalize on several secular tailwinds within the healthcare sector. Themes, such as an aging global population and increased spending on treating chronic diseases, support a positive long-term outlook for the company.\n\nManagement is guiding for full-year organic revenue growth between 4.75% and 5% in fiscal 2025, with strength across its key segments. The company's EPS target range of $5.44 to $5.50 represents a 10.5% increase at the midpoint from the fiscal 2024 result. What's particularly encouraging is that the company has hiked these estimates in each of the last two quarters, with comments from management projecting confidence for the momentum to continue.\n\nAnother better-than-expected quarterly report, when the company releases its third-quarter results in late February, could serve as a catalyst for shares to rally higher.\n\n3. Medtronic's compelling valuation\n\nPerhaps the best reason Medtronic makes for a compelling investment is that the stock looks like a bargain, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16. This level is deeply discounted compared to its medtech peer group -- including companies like Abbott Laboratories, Stryker, Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences, and GE HealthCare Technologies -- which have an average forward P/E closer to 27:\n\nGiven Medtronic's trend toward more profitable growth, I believe the stock is undervalued; there's room for the valuation gap with its peers to narrow as results over the next few quarters reaffirm its improved long-term outlook. The stock also now offers a 3.1% dividend yield, making it an attractive high-quality income idea.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWith its AI-powered innovations gaining traction, improving financial performance, and attractive valuation metrics, Medtronic is a smart idea for long-term investors who have diversified portfolios. I'm bullish, and predict shares of Medtronic will outperform in 2025.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Biological Drugs - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Biological Drugs was estimated at US$345.3 Billion in 2023 and is projected to reach US$634.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2023 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\nBiological drugs have transformed the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes by offering highly targeted, effective therapies. Biologics are also at the forefront of precision medicine, enabling treatments to be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, which enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces side effects.\n\nHow Is the R&D Pipeline Shaping the Future of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe biological drugs market is witnessing significant innovation, particularly in monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and therapeutic proteins. New biologics are being developed to address unmet medical needs, especially in areas like oncology, neurology, and rare genetic disorders. Advances in biotechnology, including CRISPR and CAR-T therapies, are allowing for the development of personalized biologics that can modify disease pathways or even repair defective genes. The growing number of biologics in the development pipeline, coupled with advances in manufacturing techniques like continuous bioprocessing, is making it easier to produce biologics at scale, which will be key to meeting global healthcare needs in the future.\n\n\n\nHow Is the Adoption of Biological Drugs Impacting Healthcare Systems?\n\n\n\nAs biologics become more prevalent in treating chronic and life-threatening diseases, they are reshaping healthcare delivery systems. However, their high cost has led to challenges in terms of affordability and accessibility, particularly in developing markets. To address this, biosimilars - essentially, cheaper, highly similar versions of biologic drugs - are gaining traction.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of biosimilars is expected to reduce the overall healthcare burden and make these life-saving treatments more accessible to a broader population. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to facilitate the approval and market entry of biosimilars, which could significantly influence pricing dynamics and competition in the biological drugs market.\n\n\n\nWhat Role Does Regulatory Approval Play in the Expansion of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe regulatory landscape for biological drugs is a critical factor in market growth. Stringent approval processes ensure that biologics meet the highest safety and efficacy standards, which can be a lengthy and expensive endeavor for drug manufacturers. However, as regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) streamline pathways for both biologics and biosimilars, the pace of approvals has increased, particularly for drugs targeting rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Favorable regulations and accelerated approval processes for orphan drugs and breakthrough therapies are helping to bring innovative biologics to market more quickly, contributing to the overall expansion of this sector.\n\n\n\nThe growth in the biological drugs market is driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the rise of precision medicine, and advancements in biotechnological research. The growing demand for personalized therapies that offer more effective treatment with fewer side effects is a major driver.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of novel biologics for rare and complex conditions, along with favorable government policies supporting biologics R&D, is boosting market expansion. The rise of biosimilars is also playing a critical role, as they are poised to increase market accessibility and reduce treatment costs, thereby further driving growth in the biologics segment.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2023 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of major players in the Global Biological Drugs Market such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Biogen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and more.\n\nComplimentary Updates: Receive free report updates for one year to keep you informed of the latest market developments.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nMarket Growth: Understand the significant growth trajectory of the Therapeutic Protein segment, which is expected to reach US$289.1 Billion by 2030 with a CAGR of a 10.3%.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$20b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 12% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Abbott Laboratories, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories\n\nNYSE:ABT Ownership Breakdown January 27th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Abbott Laboratories?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Abbott Laboratories. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Abbott Laboratories, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:ABT Earnings and Revenue Growth January 27th 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Abbott Laboratories is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.6% and 7.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory Continues",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC discussed the reasons behind the recent market declines after the ISM Services Index data. Cramer said many are still expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve soon but they are wrong.\n\n\u201cThis survey showed surprising strength, so much strength that it makes you think that the FED might not give us more rate cuts anytime soon. Right now, a ton of investors believe that the FED needs to push through a bunch of rate cuts in order to revive the economy. Lots of those bulls are counting on those cuts. That seems wrong today. They were rocked to the core because not only have they been wrong, but they\u2019re starting to question the FED\u2019s credibility. They know nothing,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nCramer said he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the Fed\u2019s rate cuts amid strong economic data.\n\n\u201cThese traders are wondering why the heck the FED cut short rates by 50 basis points September then give another 25 in November another 25 in December what the heck did they see that made them so aggressive judging by the data. Nothing. The credibility issue, if you claim you\u2019re data dependent, and the data is strong then why the heck are you cutting so aggressively.\u201d\n\nCramer at the time said the latest nonfarm payrolls report would be one of the most important indicators of the economy and it would set the \u201cdialog\u201d in the coming days. Sure it will. The latest jobs data showed unemployment fell and job additions crushed Wall Street expectations. Many now believe the Fed is set to put brakes on rate cuts.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer recently talked about.

This is great because it means if one of these businesses faces tough times, another could compensate and maintain overall growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, this is happening right now. With coronavirus testing on the decline, the diagnostics business has seen revenue fall. But in the third quarter, the medical devices unit delivered double-digit revenue growth, helping Abbott to report a 5% year-over-year increase in revenue to $10.6 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbbott sells market-leading products across its businesses, from the Ensure brand in its nutrition business to the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system in its medical devices unit. The company also has a full pipeline of innovations to keep the growth going. It most recently launched Lingo, a CGM platform for wellness purposes.\n\nBusiness Briefing Become a business insider with the latest news. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAsk The Fool\n\nFrom D.L., Flagstaff, Ariz.: What\u2019s a good way to invest in socially responsible companies?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on socially responsible companies. That saves you the trouble of studying companies and choosing the most promising ones \u2014 you instead let professional stock analysts do that work. Or, with passively managed funds, the managers simply hold the same securities that are in a socially responsible index.\n\nSome such funds have the acronym ESG in their title, meaning that they focus on \u201cenvironmental, social and governance\u201d factors. Here are a few to read up on and consider: The iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ticker: ESGU), the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) and the Invesco ESG NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQMG).\n\nUnderstand that there are many ways for you (or a fund) to invest responsibly. You might focus on companies that seem to be doing good for the environment or society. Or you might just avoid companies you find objectionable \u2014 such as those that make and sell products you disapprove of. (perhaps alcohol, guns or tobacco, for example).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, too, that few companies will be perfect on every issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, they might treat the planet well but skimp on employee pay and benefits. You can learn much more at sites such as GreenMoney.com, CorpWatch.org, CSRwire.com and CorporateRegister.com\n\nFrom V.N., Bella Vista, Ark.: Why does the stock market\u2019s value go up or down every day?\n\nThe total market value reflects the movement of thousands of companies\u2019 stocks. Each stock moves frequently, influenced by what investors think of it, based on the latest news or developments. Good news often pushes a stock\u2019s price up, and bad news does the opposite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbbott shares recently traded at a forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22. That\u2019s a reasonable price to pay for a company that has a strong track record of growth, leading products and solid long-term prospects.\n\n(The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Abbott Laboratories.)\n\nThe Fool\u2019s School\n\nLong-term care (LTC) insurance \u2014 which helps pay for nursing home, assisted living, or in-home care you may need in the future \u2014 is a kind of financial protection that most of us should consider. It\u2019s expensive, though \u2014 for policy holders and insurers alike \u2014 making the decision regarding whether to get it rather complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacing LTC costs without it can be tough: The folks at Genworth recently noted that a year of home health aides averages around $75,500 per year nationally, while a year in an assisted living facility costs $64,200 and a shared nursing home room averages $104,000. Without LTC insurance, if you end up needing help with daily activities such as eating, dressing and bathing, you might deplete your savings paying for care or may have to rely heavily on family members to care for you.\n\nA 2022 government report estimated that 56% of people turning 65 would need long-term services and supports for some period. So what should you do? Definitely look into LTC insurance, paying attention to what a policy will and won\u2019t cover. The average annual premium for a $165,000 benefit policy was recently $950 for a single male and $1,500 for a single female, both aged 55. (Women tend to live longer and often need more care.) The older you are when you sign up, the higher the price will likely be.\n\nYou might be able to pay less if you buy a policy in your 50s, or you and your life partner buy policies together. You might also save by opting for policy features such as a shorter coverage period (such as two years instead of five) or a waiting period before the policy starts paying, or by forgoing inflation protection.\n\nYour decision on a LTC policy will likely be heavily influenced by how much money you have now and will have in the future, but it\u2019s worth looking into. Alternative ways to pay for care include health savings accounts (HSAs) and some annuities that feature long-term care benefits. Read up on LTC insurance before you buy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy Smartest Investment\n\nFrom Anonymous: I\u2019m 84 years old and earned an average middle-class salary during my working years, but I did several things that made me wealthy. I maxed out contributions to retirement plans, such as 401(k)s and SEP IRAs. I invested those contributions in no-load mutual funds.\n\nMy smartest move was in 1998, when Roth IRAs became available. My accountant asked if I had confidence that the U.S. stock market would grow at about 6% or more over the next 10-plus years. I said yes. He then recommended converting as much as of my retirement funds into Roth IRAs as I could. This caused a significant financial burden since there was a large tax due with each conversion.\n\nMy wife and I agreed it was worth it. We lived frugally for a few years to make it work. Now in retirement, our only income is Social Security, a small pension and required minimum distributions from our SEP IRAs. Our portfolio is under seven figures and mostly in Roth IRAs, meaning we can withdraw as much as we need tax-free! Those years of living frugally were well worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fool responds: Bravo! Roth IRAs can indeed be powerful wealth builders, and ending up with a big account to tap tax-free in retirement is hard to beat.\n\n(Do you have a smart or regrettable investment move to share with us?

I joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1896 and soon had European clients. I got into investment banking in the early 1900s and helped Sears, Roebuck and Co. go public in 1906.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was a pioneer in valuing companies by their earnings prospects instead of their hard assets. With a recent market value of $180 billion, I\u2019m a top global financial services company; I have more than $3 trillion in assets under supervision and more than $50 billion in annual revenue.\n\nWho am I?\n\nForget last week\u2019s question?

Sales of Ensure helped to drive a 9% sales increase in Abbott's nutritional products, which accounted for $4.4 billion and 10% of the company's total revenue.\n\nRead More: Amazon picks where the first of its $10 billion in data centers will go in Ohio\n\nEnsure, what Abbott describes as a \"balanced nutrition drink with the right mix of protein, vitamins, minerals, and calories,\" was developed 50 years ago for use in hospitals, according to the company. Doctors use Ensure to nourish patients who are not able to eat, swallow or consume proper diets, including people who are hospitalized or in long-term care facilities.\n\nSince Ensure was first created, Abbot has expanded the brand into more than 12 different Ensure products. The offerings reflect a variety of dietary and lifestyle preferences, including products that are plant-based, non-dairy, low in sugar or carbohydrates, high in protein, and formulations designed for surgical and immune system support, according to Abbott.\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, Abbott employs roughly 114,000 employees in more than 160 countries, according to the company.\n\nAbbott Nutrition's roots go back to the 1920s when the Moores & Ross Milk Co. in Columbus began producing milk-based infant formula.

While each produced a solid quarter, Abbott Laboratories outperformed and has a more robust outlook. The outlook is for Abbott\u2019s growth to be sustained above Q4\u2019s 7.2% pace in 2025, with growth accelerating YOY and margin widening. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s results will be sluggish in comparison.\n\nThe analysts' reaction to the Q4 results highlights the potential for outperformance. Abbott analysts are raising price targets and firming sentiment, while JNJ\u2019s do the opposite. The takeaway is that JNJ stock has headwinds and ABT tailwinds to increase its share price. The consensus in mid-January implies a 10% upside in 2025, while revisions suggest a move to the high-end range is likely, adding another 12.5% to the forecast.\n\nGet Abbott Laboratories alerts: Sign Up\n\nAssuming Abbott continues to perform well, the odds are high that the analyst's trends will continue to lift market sentiment as the year progresses.\n\nThe sentiment for Johnson & Johnson isn\u2019t bad, only less bullish, and a cap for the price action gives Abbott\u2019s strengths. MarketBeat.com tracks several revisions, and 100% have reduced the price target to a range below the consensus. Even so, the sentiment is firm at Hold with a Bullish bias; 45% rate the stock at Buy and 55% at Hold with no Sells. Upside potential runs in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range this year.\n\nGrowth and Guidance are the Critical Factors in ABT and JNJ Results\n\nBoth companies reported OK quarters, and JNJ even outperformed relative to the analyst consensus. However, JNJ\u2019s results are tepid, with top-line growth of only 5.1% compared to Abbott\u2019s 7.2%, and earnings quality and guidance are also factors. Segmentally, JNJ\u2019s medtech segment was the most substantial but underperformed forecasts, while the Innovative Medicine segment outperformed.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Q4 revenue came in below consensus partly because of weakness in COVID-19 testing, but organic growth is double-digit, and all segments contributed. Coincidentally, Abbott\u2019s Medical Devices segment led with an increase of 14%, driven by a robust pipeline of products.\n\nThe bottom-line results are also good and sufficient to sustain the capital return outlook. Still, again, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Q4 outperformance is overshadowed by tepid guidance and underperformance relative to Abbott. Both forecast revenue and earnings growth this year, but Abbott\u2019s will be more substantial and more likely to outperform early 2025 estimates.\n\nIt is growing organically in all segments, and COVID-19 impacts are fading fast. The pipeline is robust, with 15 new opportunities and numerous product launches expected across product lines.\n\nJNJ\u2019s Value or Abbott\u2019s Quality; Investors Win Either Way\n\nJohnson & Johnson Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$170.67\n\n5.12% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 18 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $215.00 Average Forecast $170.67 Low Forecast $150.00 Johnson & Johnson Stock Forecast Details\n\nBoth dividends are attractive but appeal to different types of inventors. Johnson & Johnson offers a high-yielding value with a dividend worth 3.4% at only 13X earnings, while Abbott\u2019s yield is lower and its valuation higher. The trade-off is the outlook for share price appreciation, which is more robust in Abbott\u2019s case.\n\nAbbott could increase in value by 10% to 20% in 2025, and the estimates are rising, while Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10% gain is questionable. Analysts could reduce their price targets as the year progresses and keep this stock near long-term lows.\n\nThe technical action shows a bottom in JNJ stock, limiting the downside risks. Abbott\u2019s chart, on the other hand, looks strong, with price action set to break above a critical resistance point. The critical resistance is at the top of a trading range and is a significant trigger point when crossed. The market could continue on to retest the 2021 highs in that scenario and then rally to new highs later in the year or in 2026.\n\nBefore you consider Abbott Laboratories, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Abbott Laboratories wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Abbott Laboratories currently has a \"Moderate Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nCisco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +23.9%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscriptions accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Increases in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Abbott have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. +18.6%). The company\u2019s pipeline is unlocking new growth opportunities, supporting the company\u2019s positive momentum and strong growth outlook for 2025. Freestyle Libre, Lingo and Libre Rio CGM devices are on a great trajectory. Alinity, the company\u2019s next-generation suite of systems, is a key driver in the core lab diagnostics business.\n\n\n\nThe company is optimistic about its latest progress with biosimilars and expects this to significantly boost EPD sales, beginning 2025. Within Nutrition, despite softness in its international pediatric segment, Abbott is regaining market share banking on a strong Adult Nutrition business.\n\n\n\nYet the significant runoff of COVID-19 testing-related sales is hurting Abbott\u2019s Diagnostics growth. Headwinds such as tough macro conditions and foreign exchange also add to the worry.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>>)\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+6.3% vs. -4.6%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evident by its strong track record of beating expectations. In third-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the seventh consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement.\n\n\n\nResults benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. KO is well-poised to benefit from its marketing and innovation strategies, and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024.\n\n\n\nIt expects organic revenue growth of 10% for 2024, with comparable EPS to grow 5-6%. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Fiserv, Inc.

Reported EPS is $1.34 EPS, expectations were $1.34.\n\nOperator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Comilla: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we\u2019ll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis, for the non-GAAP financial measures for which the company is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items, which could significantly impact Abbott\u2019s results in accordance with GAAP.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. First, I want to express gratitude to my Abbott colleagues around the world whose hard work and passion with the driving forces of Abbott\u2019s continued success. Abbott\u2019s commitment to innovation, operational excellence and serving the needs of our customers resulted in another year of exceptional performance, which included achieving sales growth of 9.5% excluded COVID testing, delivering 70 basis points of gross margin profile improvement, driving acceleration in the growth of our earnings per share throughout the year and developing and advancing new products through our rich pipeline. The strong performance resulted in generating $8.5 billion of operating cash flow, which was used to reinvest in the business, fund capacity expansions, repay debt and returned $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThese accomplishments played a key role in continuing our well-established track record for delivering on our financial commitments, which included achieving results that finished at the high end of our initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. These results included exiting the year with a very strong momentum as fourth quarter sales grew 10%, excluding COVID testing sales, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13% versus the prior year. For 2025, we\u2019re well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. I\u2019ll now summarize our fourth quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil.\n\nI\u2019ll start with Nutrition. Our sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in adult nutrition, led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. We achieved a significant milestone last year with annual sales of Ensure surpassing $3 billion. This achievement helped deliver another year of strong performance in adult nutrition, with annual sales of adult nutrition products growing 9% last year. This strong performance is a continuation of a well-established trend, the five year compound annual growth rate in adult nutrition is 9%, which reflects the impact of our well-known and respected brands, favorable demographic trends, the significant investments we\u2019ve made to expand manufacturing capacity to serve the growing global demand for our products.\n\nMoving to Diagnostics, where sales increased 6%, excluded COVID testing sales. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where excluded COVID testing sales increased 16% in the quarter. This was driven by strong demand for our portfolio of respiratory disease tests used to help diagnose influenza, strep throat and RSV. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for our market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels. Excluding the impact of challenging market dynamics in China, the combined growth in all other markets was double digits in the quarter. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8.5% in the quarter. Growth was well balanced across markets and therapeutic areas that we participate in, including gastroenterology, women\u2019s health, CNS and pain management.\n\nEPD also delivered broad-based growth across the markets we serve, including double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. By focusing on the therapies most needed in these faster-growing markets, we continue to sustain our long track record of delivering strong growth, which includes a five-year compound annual growth rate for EPD of 8%. And I\u2019ll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 14%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.8 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. For the full year 2024, sales of continuous glucose monitors were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22%. This included growth of 27% in the U.S. where our market share on a revenue basis has increased by more than 10 share points over the last three years.\n\nIn electrophysiology, growth of 9% was well balanced across the U.S. and international markets. As expected, growth in the quarter was impacted by a challenging comparison versus the prior year where we saw a sharp increase in demand for our EnSite cardiac mapping systems as customers prepared for the launch of PFA catheters. Excluding the impact of this prior year comparison dynamic, growth would have been double digits globally in the U.S. and internationally. In Structural Heart, growth of 23% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Structural Heart represents one of the most attractive areas in the field of medical technologies.\n\nIt is an area that we have invested in heavily, and we\u2019re seeing those investments yield outstanding results. Our comprehensive portfolio of products drove an acceleration in sales growth in Structural Heart throughout the year. In Rhythm Management, growth of 7% was led by AVEIR, our innovative leadless pacemaker and Assert, our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which we launched in the U.S. last year. With growth of 7% for the full year, our Rhythm Management business delivered another year of performance that far exceeded the market, and we expect that to continue this year. Last month, we announced that we completed the first-in-human implant of a new version of AVEIR specifically designed to deliver pacing to the left bundle branch area of the heart, activating the heart\u2019s natural conduction system.\n\nThis highly innovative device currently in development was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. In Heart Failure, growth of 9.5% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart-assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In Vascular, growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure products and growth from Esprit are below-the-knee resorbable stent. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 8%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales growing 10% and earnings per share growing 13%. For the year, we achieved the upper end of the initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024.\n\nWe made great progress expanding our gross margin profile, and we expect that progress to continue into 2025. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities, and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in 2025. I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhil Boudreau: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results. Sales increased 8.8% on an organic basis and increased 10.1% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against most currencies, which resulted in unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the fourth quarter.\n\nLastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for 2025. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range and contemplates an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $1.05 to $1.09 for the first quarter. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%. Please note that we are no longer providing separate guidance for the sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales as COVID testing sales represents less than 2% of total company sales in 2024. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our first quarter reported sales.\n\nWe expect our full year 2025 adjusted gross margin profile to be around 57% of sales, which reflects an improvement of around 80 basis points versus the prior year. We forecast our full year 2025 adjusted operating margin profile to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% of sales, which reflects an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year at the midpoint of range. This improvement is driven by a combination of strong gross margin expansion and operating margin leverage. We forecast our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, which reflects an increase compared to last year related to the adoption of the Pillar 2 tax framework. With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Follow Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter and guide. And maybe, Robert, I could start with the 2025 guide, once again guiding to high single-digit organic sales growth, healthy operating margin expansion, and nice to see 10% EPS growth back in the algorithm again. Maybe you could just speak to some of the key growth drivers and how we should think about the different business segments on the top line and some of the components of the operating margin expansion down the P&L? Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. Yes, it\u2019s nice to see kind of the headline print now back to double-digit EPS growth. I think that\u2019s probably one of the things that \u2014 it\u2019s one of the things you\u2019ll see now, Robbie, as we go into 2025. I mean, you\u2019ve got a lot of growth drivers there. But I think one of the big things is that you don\u2019t have the COVID sales decline cloud that\u2019s kind of overshadowing all these real strong growth drivers that we got in the business. And you saw that in Q3 as we showed 13% EPS \u2014 sorry, in Q4 as we showed 13% EPS growth. So I think that\u2019s one big aspect. It\u2019s just not having those sales decline. I mean we\u2019ve got COVID sales in 2025, but it\u2019s, as Phil said in his comments, significantly less from our total revenue perspective.\n\nI think it starts with the top line always, Robbie, and the markets that we compete in, they remain attractive. We\u2019re seeing acceleration in several of them. I mean we\u2019re a very diversified healthcare companies so we get to benefit from all the different dynamics that are going on in healthcare, whether it\u2019s increased health and wellness focus from consumers, we get to benefit from that on our Nutrition business. Every treatment requires a diagnostic test, about 70% of them require diagnostic test, so we\u2019re seeing continued growth over there. And then we\u2019ve got two areas where we focus on treatments, whether it\u2019s pharmaceuticals or med tech. And so all of those markets, they\u2019re accelerating. And then within them, we\u2019ve got strong product portfolios that are either keeping up with these very high-growth markets, or we\u2019re outperforming the market and taking shares.\n\nAnd if you look at the contributions, we\u2019ve got your current drivers, whether it\u2019s Libre, TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, Amulet, all of those products in the cardiovascular space. So the bases are loaded, I would call that. And then you\u2019ve got a nice on-deck circle and the lineup of Abbott that are coming up right after that, whether it\u2019s biosimilars, volt, innovations in the Libre portfolio, some clinical trial readouts. So I think we feel very good about all of the businesses, and you saw all of the businesses improved their growth from Q3 to Q4. So I think it starts with the top line, and I think we\u2019re well positioned in them. To your question on the margin drivers, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got \u2014 we\u2019ve done a lot of work on gross margin expansion. We\u2019ve talked about that committing to a 70-basis-point improvement in 2024.\n\nWe achieved that. We believe that we can achieve another 80 basis points of improvement in 2025, and that\u2019s what\u2019s embedded in that guide is continuous improvement on the gross margin in the tune of 80 basis points, will be driven by continued focus on gross margin improvement programs and then mix as some of the higher gross margin products continue to grow ahead of the company average, you get that mix effect. And then down the P&L, I think you\u2019ve got an opportunity, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, to be able to leverage the business and obtain spending leverage across the business. And again, I think that was another challenge we had during COVID or as the COVID was coming down, we really only relied on one lever of margin expansion, which was gross margin equipment.\n\nI\u2019d say now you\u2019ve got two. We actually have two, which is our original formula, gross margin expansion and then spending leverage. So you put all that together, you\u2019ve got about 16% actually underlying growth in the EPS coming from the top line, the gross margin improvement and the spending leverage. And then we\u2019ve got, obviously, some friction on FX. I think every company is going to face that as we\u2019ve seen the strengthening dollar, and increased tax rates, which also aren\u2019t a surprise. We\u2019ve known about that. And so that brings us down to that 10%. So I kind of look at this and say, okay, what you\u2019ve seen now for 2025 is the Abbott that we know, the Abbott identity that we built, which is high single-digit top line, double-digit bottom line, gross margin improvement, spending, leverage and productivity, strong operating cash flow.\n\nWe know how to deal with FX. So we deal with it every year, and we\u2019re dealing with it again this year and still being able to deliver double-digit EPS. Dealing with a higher tax rate, so I think I saw some notes about calendarization about maybe Q1 not coming in. I could tell you, we looked at our Q1 and all of our gating or EPS is very much aligned to what it was in 2024. It\u2019s very much aligned to what it was pre-COVID. So again, all the elements of Abbott and the Abbott identity that we know are there, and we\u2019re looking forward to 2025.\n\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Robert, I guess you talked about, it starts with the top line. You had another really strong year for CGM with over 20% constant currency growth of $6.5 billion in sales. So I\u2019d love to hear you talk about your expectations for growth in 2025. The status of the Libre 3 supply issues and any color you have on the Lingo launch? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford: Sure. So let me talk about Libre 3 supply. As we spoke about during the last call, Larry, there was a little bit of a mismatch, but our manufacturing coming up online and the demand that we were seeing, especially here in the US. That caused a little bit of friction there, but as I said, we were in process of getting our new manufacturing site up and running. I was there in November and seen the team and that\u2019s going now at full force. So Libre 3 supply with two manufacturing sites up and running and I think you\u2019ll start to see throughout the next one or two quarters a change here and a little bit on the NBRxs on the TRxs. I know you guys like to look at those quite often, I guess, those are an important metric to look at it, Larry, but they\u2019re not the only metric to see how the businesses are doing.\n\nI mean, I think you saw that in our Q4. We\u2019re able to grow the US 24%. So there are other elements that aren\u2019t measured. I think you also \u2014 you guys also saw the impact of relying exclusively on those data\u2019s in Q3 as competitors had challenges also. So it\u2019s an important metric to look at, but I would say, it\u2019s not the only ones, and I think we\u2019ve kind of shown that here. So Libre 3 is doing pretty well and it\u2019s just going to get better. As I look at 2025, I\u2019d say there are some pretty interesting kind of growth drivers here for us. I\u2019d say, first, as a base case, I still think there\u2019s under-penetration in the intensive insulin using segment. I mean, if you look at the US, there\u2019s still 25% of that segment that are not on CGMs, and if you think about that international, it\u2019s more like 50%.\n\nSo I still think as a base case to driving all this growth, there\u2019s all this opportunity in this segment, but I think there are three areas in 2025 that I believe accelerates that opportunity for us. One of them is obviously basal coverage. And we continue to see with the publication of more clinical evidence, you see more and more markets move towards expanding basal coverage, reimbursement coverage. Now we have a couple of markets where we\u2019re the only ones that do have that coverage, whether it\u2019s Japan or Canada. These are large markets. So these are great opportunities for us where we\u2019ve got this head start and we\u2019ll keep on driving that. So I think Basel is a big bucket of growth. I think the other area that I talked about as being an area of growth for us is more a kind of share \u2014 ability to take share, and that\u2019s through connectivity strategies with insulin delivery systems.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about all the things that we\u2019ve been doing with regards to partnership with insulin pump companies. And I think you\u2019ll see throughout this year several announcements on connectivity in different geographies, and that\u2019s gives us the opportunity to penetrate, albeit a smaller segment, but be able to penetrate that segment and take share. And I think the third area of growth for us of acceleration is just the whole OTC non-diabetes application with the launch of Lingo continue to see very nice trends. We\u2019ve launched it in a restricted number of U.S. cities, but I think now that we understand what it takes to be able drive adoption with this completely different consumer segment that we\u2019ll probably be expanding this and expanding this more nationally here in the U.S. and potentially looking at other areas internationally due to bring this.\n\nSo I think the Lingo launch is going very well. In several areas, I think, it surpassed some of my expectations, especially regarding reorder rates. And I think those continue, and I think that\u2019s going to be another kind of leg of the stool so as to say on growth. So I think those are really the kind of growth drivers that we\u2019ve got planned for Libre. I think the insulin \u2014 intensive insulin segment is still an opportunity, a pretty significant opportunity. And then you\u2019ve got these three accelerators on top of that.\n\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about EP growth, so still strong high single digits in the quarter, and I think it was even faster than that, excluding the tough mapping comp. There\u2019s a lot of things moving around in that market right now. One competitor had a big setback in DSA and your progress is moving forward with both. So just thinking about how you\u2019re thinking about EP growth in 2025 as you bridge the PFA in 2026 and your ability to kind of regain market share once both launches?\n\nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes, I mean, I think this was not a surprise for us, and it wasn\u2019t really driven by any kind of adoption of PFA regarding our Q4 growth rate. In fact, as I\u2019ve said in previous calls, I think the net effect for us \u2014 net-net effect for us has actually been very positive. What we did have was an execution of that strategy, Travis, where we said, okay, we\u2019re going to bridge ourselves, and one of the ways to do that is through our mapping. And that\u2019s what really drove our success in 2024 is we did in Q4 of 2023, really taking advantage of our ability to offer the only real open \u2014 truly open mapping system. So that created that comp issue. It was double digits in Q4, 12% in the U.S., 12% internationally. So still seem very good.\n\nAnd I think, again, I would say, these results, I think we outperformed a lot of the expectations that many of you guys had about our EP business. And I think the driver of that has been the team. The team in the field has just been spectacular, I think. And I\u2019ve been close to them last year and I think what they did was really strong. So, I guess I answered your question in 2025, really looking at what we did in 2024. And I expect to continue to benefit in 2025 from the \u2014 just the general increasing procedure trends. We\u2019ve got opportunities to grow with some recently launched products, whether it\u2019s our GridX, our next-generation mapping catheter, our new Agilis Introducer Sheath, I mean that\u2019s a great opportunity for us also. So, yes, it\u2019s going to be a little bit more competitive.\n\nIt\u2019s been pretty competitive in 2024. I expect that intensity to increase when it comes to the ablation catheters. But I\u2019m confident that we can maintain a strong position in the mapping segment and everything that comes with all the consumables that come with that. On top of that, our pipeline is very strong. We\u2019ll continue to engage KOLs and our customers. We\u2019ve got an ongoing trial right now with a dual energy source catheter internationally and in the U.S. We\u2019ve got integration with ICE. We\u2019ve got kind of new sheets to launch. So, I think the pipeline allows us to continue that interaction with the KOLs and with the users. So, we should expect \u2014 I think you mentioned bridging to PFA in 2026. It\u2019s more like 2025 on PFA, at least internationally.\n\nSo, I feel good about it. And maybe you\u2019ve got a tail of two halves, where the second half is going to grow faster than the first half as Volt comes on board. But I\u2019d say, for the full year, high single-digits seems like a good place to start, call that our base case. And then to the point that you made about competition and some of the dynamics that have occurred in the last couple of weeks, it\u2019s still a little bit too early to tell, but that could be an opportunity for us also. So, I feel good about the business, not only the pipeline, but more importantly, the team that we\u2019ve got. They\u2019re doing an incredible real strong job.\n\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar: Hi Robert. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess I had a two-part question, if you don\u2019t mind. Really strong operating margins, driven both by gross margins and operating leverage, but your gross margins are still below pre-pandemic levels. So, I\u2019m curious, when you look at the margins, how sustainable are these trends, perhaps not at triple-digits, but should we be thinking about trend margin framework as gross margins normalize? And my second part is on balance sheet. I\u2019m curious there\u2019s been some M&A activity picking up in MedTech. How you\u2019re thinking about devices versus diagnostics? I\u2019m curious any thoughts on that cancer screening, MRD, et cetera?\n\nRobert Ford: I\u2019ll let Phil talk to the gross margin and the sustainability of that margin improvement, and then I\u2019ll take your balance sheet question.\n\nPhil Boudreau: Yes. Thanks, Robert and Vijay here. On the gross margin front, I think we spoke to this in the last few calls and nothing here has really changed relative to an underlying focus of the business and of the organization, as Robert touched on here. I think the difference in recent years causing that erosion was the significant inflation in commodity prices, which has really resorted back to, I\u2019d call it, normalized inflationary pressures that we\u2019re very much accustomed to managing through with our organizations and focus on gross margin expansion. And so what you saw in 2024 was exactly that, the recipe we\u2019re accustomed to and the commitment in 2025 to do much of the same. So from expense standpoint, we expect this to continue, and it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when we get back to the legacy and historical gross margin profiles.\n\nRobert Ford: Yeah. I guess on your question on balance sheet. I\u2019ve always talked about this, Vijay. I mean, we do take this kind of balanced approach. I\u2019m not going to give you a formula of how much goes to here, how much goes to their. We do take a balanced approach. And on your M&A question, yeah, there\u2019s been an uptake of activity, no doubt. There are some good opportunities out there and whether \u2014 and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a change in rate environment, but maybe on the regulatory environment, I think that creates opportunity. I\u2019ve said that we\u2019ve got a strong organic pipeline. It allows us to be selective. It allows us to look at opportunities that make sense strategically, but also generate an attractive return.\n\nI talked about how ROIC is important for us also. So not just top line, but return on that capital. So we do take a position here of being stewards of that capital. So I\u2019d say, yes, we\u2019re in great position. We do have some debt to pay down this year, which we will. I don\u2019t anticipate rates coming down to the point that we might want to look at refinancing that. So we\u2019ll pay off that debt. It\u2019s about $1.5 billion this year. But even with that, we\u2019re in a great position with our balance sheet to be able to leverage opportunities that we\u2019ll see, talked about them. There\u2019s opportunities in med-tech, there\u2019s opportunities in diagnostics, and we\u2019re in a great position, and it allows us to be selective.\n\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I echo Vijay\u2019s congrats on a strong finish to the year. Another margin question just because the operating margin guidance for 2025 was some stronger than expected, I think you talked about a lot of the drivers, Robert and Phil, but just a continued positive mix shift from stronger macro device contributions and the strong top line growth. But I was hoping you may just help us think through just the margin expansion opportunities in EPD, Nutrition and Diagnostics. And just with the outsized expansion in 2025, how should we be thinking about sustained open expansion in 2026 and beyond? And then should we be thinking about 50 to 100 basis points a year? I appreciate you taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford: Yeah. I\u2019d like to get to that pre-pandemic gross margin. I mean, I know we talk a lot about this being behind where we were from a pre-pandemic. But our op margin profile, especially after our guidance for 2025 is actually ahead of that. So we\u2019ve been able to achieve that through our spending and spending efficiencies. But I think that\u2019s the right range to have. I mean I think we\u2019ve always had this notion. I mean, I talked about being able to offset FX and things like that and not provide any surprises. That\u2019s part of the algorithm there, which is we\u2019re just constantly having to address gross margin. It\u2019s not like this initiative either because of inflation or bits of tariffs or anything like that, it\u2019s just we\u2019re constantly working to improve gross margins.\n\nI\u2019d say, on the nutrition side, those gross margins, given what we encountered over the last two years, those came down. But if you look at them, they have been improving sequentially almost like every quarter. We\u2019ve got a ways to go to get back to where we were in 2022, Josh. That\u2019s a little bit more dependent on commodities and freight and distribution, things like that. But I think the teams have got a really good strategy here of kind of working on cost to serve and even, quite frankly, using some pricing where we felt we had to because of some of the increase in those commodities. So I think the Nutrition gross margin is definitely an opportunity that we\u2019ve got over the next couple of years. The pharmaceutical teams have done an incredible job at maintaining a gross margin under pretty significant FX.\n\nI mean they do a fantastic job at offsetting FX. If you look at the margin profile in that business, it\u2019s actually increased several \u2014 couple of hundred basis points over the last couple of years. So they\u2019ve been able to do that also through gross margin. And I think the other element is just ensuring that we keep on driving the med tech business that have accretive gross margins quite frankly, across all of those different business units. And if we can continue to do that, then that\u2019s how you get to that model of maybe 50 to 100 basis points every single year. That\u2019s our target. We committed to 70, and we deliver to 70, we\u2019re now committing to 80 for 2025. And getting us closer to where we were pre pandemic. So I feel good about what we\u2019re doing, the strategy we got in place, the discipline that we have as a management team to review these programs and dedicate time.\n\nThey don\u2019t just happen. We got to make decisions. There\u2019s oversight. So I feel good about it.\n\nJosh Jennings: Excellent. Thanks, again.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Roman: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping, Robert, you could go into a little bit more detail on the Structural Heart business. As you kind of break down the pieces that portfolio, you have a balance of drivers, some more legacy like MitraClip and some that are more emerging categories, like TriClip and the tricuspid repair segment. But maybe you could help us think about the evolution of that business, which did very nicely through 2024, and how we should think about that into 2025? And maybe I could just contextualize the broader outlook here, and I appreciate your comments about getting back to the Aveir of high single-digit top line and double-digit bottom line. But it looks like 2025 does carry some headwinds that may prove to be one-time in nature like VBP dynamics in China on the diagnostics side, the transient competition in EP.\n\nSo maybe you could kind of give us some color on Structural Heart, but also help contextualize the growth rate in 2025, as we think about the long-term as well?\n\nRobert Ford: Sure. I think it\u2019s interesting, like the sixth question comes on Structural Heart after we posted a 23% growth. So thank you, David. As I said in my opening comments, I think this is one of the most attractive areas in med tech. And it\u2019s one that we looked at several years ago and said, we\u2019re going to build truly a market-leading portfolio of products. And we\u2019re not going to just kind of rely on one platform to kind of drive growth, we\u2019re really to assemble a full area here and look across the entire area. And even in surgical, I mean I think, I look at our Epic valve, the feedback I keep getting on the surgical side of it is just doing incredibly well and it\u2019s really a preferred go-to on the mitral side for surgical repair, but \u2014 replacement.\n\nBut yeah. I think in the past, David, I think our Structural Heart portfolio was just viewed as MitraClip. And quite frankly, the sales would say, yeah, that\u2019s probably the case. But as we\u2019ve been building out the portfolio, building on our stroke prevention with PFO approval, with Amulet approval and driving growth there, Amulet did very well in Q4 also grew 25%. Getting into the aortic segment, right, and really being a player there that has established now clinical credibility, whether it\u2019s through clinical trials, but also actual real-world usage of the product. They\u2019ve been seeing some of Navitor cases here in the US and just the feedback has been very, very positive. So, building our aortic portfolio there. We\u2019re making big investments, whether it\u2019s in our clinical trials to build out our indications.\n\nWe recently talked about \u2014 shared that we are developing a balloon expandable TAVR valve, and we want to have a full aortic portfolio. On the tricuspid side, we were one of the leaders there to say, hey, there\u2019s no real good transcatheter opportunity here to treat TR. And TriClip has done very well. It\u2019s done extremely well, quite frankly, throughout this year. I think the team has done an incredible job getting approved behind the competitor. I would say right now, our data says that the ratio of repair and replace is about 2:1, and we\u2019re leveraging all of that built in kind of infrastructure and scale that we already built with MitraClip. So what you see is a Structural Heart portfolio, $2.5 billion growing, let\u2019s call it, mid-teens because it much more diversified and, quite frankly, very competitive products in these high-growth areas.\n\nSo I think that\u2019s going to continue, and we\u2019re committed to making these investments. We\u2019ve got new versions of Amulet launch. We just got an approval for an updated version of TriClip to ease even more of the implant. You\u2019re going to see clinical trials read out in this area for label expansion indications in TAVR and in LAA. So this is an area that I think what you\u2019re seeing now, that kind of growth rate coming from the investments and just great execution from the team so. What was your \u2014 your question was about growth rate and\u2026\n\nDavid Roman: Yes, I was trying to speak a second there was just to contextualize the 25% growth rate given some onetime-ish headwinds like VBP in China Diagnostics and the dynamics in EP being potentially kind of transient as well?\n\nRobert Ford: Yeah. I mean, listen, every quarter, every year, there\u2019s always going to be some headwind. I want to do is here is assemble David, more tailwinds than headwinds, right? But yeah, I mean, you mentioned one, which is a little bit of a headwind for us in our diagnostic business regarding VBP. That\u2019s going to be with us in 2025 as they\u2019re rolling out new panels of testing that\u2019s going to go through that. But outside of that, I\u2019d say, the diagnostics business is doing very well. Q4 growth rates in most areas were actually higher than the full year growth rate in those same areas, US, Latin America, Europe, even Japan was faster in Q4. So yes, we do have a challenge, but most companies are going to do it. And you know what, we\u2019ve gone through these, David.\n\nEvery company goes through a VBP, and what we\u2019re trying to do is, okay, we\u2019re not going to define the company by having this one kind of headwind. We\u2019ve got a lot more tailwinds to leverage. We still have deal with it. We\u2019re still managing it. It\u2019s still an important part of the business. But the company is more than just VBP in diagnostics and one important market, but just one market. So I think the growth rate is very robust. I mean, 8% at the midpoint on a base of $40-plus billion, I think is pretty strong and pretty good.\n\nDavid Roman: Perfect. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the question and nice quarter. I\u2019m curious if you could just sort of step back and talk about the overall health of the MedTech market. I feel like I\u2019m constantly answering questions on things such as volume and price. And looking at you delivering mid-teens revenue growth, and I think you\u2019re seeing something that maybe not everybody is seeing, so I\u2019d love to get your view on that? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean, I think it does put us \u2014 I mean, the way our portfolio is structured, Joanne, is that it does give us a little bit of bird\u2019s eye view into the entire health care system and the spectrum, right? And I think if you\u2019re getting questions on MedTech and MedTech growth, I think all you\u2019ve got to do is continue to look at what companies are reporting. And what they\u2019re reporting is ultimately what we\u2019re seeing in the market, which is, it\u2019s not a pre-COVID pent-up demand. You are seeing a greater focus from whether consumers or the technologies that are being developed that are attracting more people into these procedures. So I think what we\u2019re seeing here is continued utilization growth really driven by whether it\u2019s demographics, combined with the innovation.\n\nI mean, what the industry is doing in terms of the innovation that we\u2019re bringing to the market, it\u2019s pretty spectacular and the procedures are getting faster, they\u2019re getting less invasive, and that\u2019s attracting more people to look at, select these procedures as a real viable first-line option versus guided medical therapy. So I think that\u2019s going to continue as long as we continue to see this innovation where we are obviously positioning ourselves pretty strongly in this, and you\u2019ve seen sequential improvement in the growth rate across quite frankly, a lot of our businesses in MedTech. So I think the utilization is definitely increasing. I think there\u2019s maybe some questions, okay, what\u2019s going to happen with pricing? We\u2019ve historically seen some price erosion in the past.\n\nI\u2019d say, over the last couple of years, it\u2019s actually been pretty stable. So I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play out. We\u2019ve got a scenario here where we believe that with our portfolio, we\u2019ll see some pretty stable pricing. But I think utilization, combined with stable pricing is what\u2019s driving this MedTech growth. And we\u2019re seeing it in diagnostics, too. A lot of our diagnostic business is actual hospital-based diagnostics. So, we\u2019re seeing those diagnostic tests and those routine diagnostics tests continue to increase, high single, double-digit, low double-digit growth rates in terms of utilization. So, I think that MedTech is benefiting from just this increased utilization and consumers wanting to take care of themselves and looking at these technologies as a viable option for treatment.\n\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you so much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter, strong end to the year. Robert, we\u2019ve talked in the past, I mean, obviously, we talked a lot about MedTech in the high-growth areas, but some areas where you\u2019ve excelled or the legacy sort of slower growth businesses, I\u2019m obviously thinking CRM being one of those mid- to high single-digits growth. Can you talk about \u2014 that you find in CRM other legacy businesses. I\u2019m thinking like heart failure, peripheral, and maybe how you\u2019re thinking about elevating those growth profiles in 2025, but then also longer term? Thanks so much for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford: Yes. So, one of our strategies that we looked at a couple of years ago, Danielle, was if you looked at our MedTech business, it was growing like 8%, 9%. And that was a combination of probably like high-growth areas like EP, Structural Heart, Diabetes, even Heart Failure. And 40% of the portfolio was relatively flat and that was mostly our Vascular business and our CRM business. And the way we looked at it is to get our MedTech to be best-in-class, to be able to grow 12%, 13%, 14%, we need to continue the strong growth rate of Structural Heart, EP, Diabetes, et cetera. But we had to find a way to accelerate the growth rate of our Vascular and CRM businesses. And we said, if we can get them, these are historically been flat growth markets.\n\nIf we can get them to grow 5% the way that would then work out is that we\u2019d be able to elevate our MedTech portfolio to the mid-teens. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years, and the team have been executing on that. I think on the Vascular space, what you\u2019ve seen us do is kind of used a little bit a combination of organic and inorganic to accelerate and increase our participation in higher growth areas, specifically in the peripheral side. So, \u2014 and I think you started to see that. We\u2019ve been growing \u2014 this quarter was a good quarter. Our target was around 5% for our Vascular business by having those \u2014 by having stronger pipelines and portfolios in that more Peripheral space. And you\u2019re seeing that now start to happen.\n\nOn the CRM side, our big strategy here was organic and getting to launch a very comprehensive and be the leaders \u2014 sorry, leaders in leadless. So, we launched a single chamber a couple of years ago, launched a dual chamber last year, going to get into conduct and pacing leadless also. And I think that you\u2019ve seen that over the last two years, our CRM business has grown 7%. And I think we can continue to extend that with the strategy that we\u2019re doing, which is to really lead in this area. I actually think that Aveir is probably the most underappreciated opportunities that we have in our portfolio. Look at it right now, you\u2019re asking the question towards the end of call, but I think really what you\u2019re seeing is these businesses, the focus, the innovation, the execution and now you\u2019re seeing those start to deliver on that strategy to bring these flat businesses up to mid \u2014 at least mid-single-digit growth.\n\nI think there\u2019s the team doesn\u2019t like that I characterize them like that. So that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad that they think that they can do better than that. But we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity in those big areas, and we think there\u2019s innovation to be had in those. So we feel good about it.\n\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\n\nMike Comilla: Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Miksic: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a follow-up here, given the tech guidance you gave for this year and some of the dynamics in US and overseas or tax policy, It\u2019d be great to get your perspective on maybe the direction of where those things are going. And how we should think about them for having? Thanks so much.\n\nPhil Boudreau: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. There\u2019s a lot of narrative at the moment going on. But to your point and to the guide that we referenced in our opening comments here, what we\u2019ve reflected is all current tax laws and guidance and geographic mix of where our business growth is coming from, which is about a 150-basis-point increase in the midpoint of this guide. That increase in the guide is driven by the increased adoption of the rollout here of Pillar 2 as is currently enacted in countries. And so that\u2019s what we reflect. We continue to be a good taxpayer, compliant taxpayer, and we\u2019ll see how more of this narrative unfolds here. But currently, we\u2019re running the operations and reflecting what\u2019s known and as Robert highlighted, absorbing still within the way we run the business.\n\nRobert Ford: Let me \u2014 I want to add in on that one, Matt. I think you\u2019ll hear this topic come up quite a bit. And if I just take a bigger picture here. I mean, corporate tax rates tend to get higher politicized and especially during election years, and it\u2019s really not a political debate. In the business world, it\u2019s just an expense. It\u2019s just another form of expense. And in our world, when one expense goes up, you\u2019ve got to manage and other expenses have got to come down or maybe not increase at the same rate that they were increasing. And I think what you\u2019ll find sometimes, you get a small handful of companies that maybe had a really low tax rate and then that viewpoint then gets unfairly applied to every large company, and then you get these predictable narratives of companies have got to pay their fair share, et cetera.\n\nThe reality is, most companies pay their fair share and then some. I mean, I could talk about Abbott. Our cash taxes are over 20%, and that\u2019s one thing that people never talk about is we use these GAAP rates. But what really matters is cash taxes. That\u2019s the money that\u2019s going to be paid. But more importantly, US companies, companies like Abbott, we play a key role in making the US economy so successful. We\u2019re conducting a significant portion of the R&D in the US. We invest billions of dollars in capital projects, which then drive this drop growth. Our CapEx spend has increased over 60% over the last couple of years. We increased our workforce by 20%. And when you increase that workforce, you\u2019re investing hundreds of millions of dollars in employee health care and employee benefits.\n\nSo this Pillar 2 legislation \u2014 this Pillar 2 rule here that got adopted, that\u2019s added. And we \u2014 I think this rate that Phil is kind of quote, that\u2019s an additional $200 million of expense. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s $200 million of expense that is not going to investing in other areas. And what\u2019s even more challenging is of those $200 million, two-thirds of it is actually going to be paid taxes to overseas countries. So that\u2019s not really a good policy for the US. And so we\u2019re absorbing this. We\u2019re managing it. And I think as still said, there are a couple still some new policies or new issues that we have to kind of work on. But I think the overall goal here has got to be to ensure the competitiveness of US companies and US multinationals. And I\u2019m hoping we can get to that during the next 12 months or so.\n\nLet me just kind of close then on the call. I think we had a really strong finish to 2024. We exited our Q4 organic sales growth was over 10% and top line, 13% EPS, as I said, finished at the higher end of our range, expanded our gross margin, delivered what we said we were going to do. The pipeline continues to be highly, highly attractive, steady cadence of great new growth opportunities. And I think, to Vijay\u2019s question, we\u2019ve got a balance sheet that\u2019s going to provide us a lot of strategic flexibility. So I think we\u2019re really well positioned to 2025. So with that, I want to thank you for joining us today.\n\nMike Comilla: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you all for joining us today.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Abbott Laboratories is a global healthcare company specializing in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide range of healthcare products. The company has its headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois and operates in more than 160 countries worldwide.\n\nThe company was founded in 1888 by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott, and it has since grown to become one of the world's largest and most respected healthcare companies. Abbott Laboratories has a diverse portfolio of products, including medical devices, diagnostic tests, nutritional products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The company is committed to developing innovative products that improve the quality of life for people worldwide.\n\nRobert B. Ford is the current President and CEO of the company. He was appointed to this position in 2020 after serving as the company's Chief Operating Officer. He has been with Abbott Laboratories since 1996 and has held various leadership positions.\n\nAbbott Laboratories has delivered strong financial performance, declining as investors seek growth. The company's net earnings have been increasing steadily. Abbott Laboratories has a solid balance sheet with a low debt-to-equity ratio. The company has consistently delivered strong cash flow, allowing it to invest in research and development and return value to shareholders. Abbott Laboratories has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than the industry average, and the company's price-to-book ratio is also higher than the industry average. These metrics suggest that the market has a positive outlook on Abbott Laboratories and is willing to pay a premium for the company's shares. Over the past year, Abbott Laboratories' stock has declined as consumers seek to see what the company will do post-pandemic. The company's shares have experienced some volatility, but overall, they have outperformed the broader market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories operates in the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and complex. The industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, changing regulatory requirements, and shifting consumer preferences. Abbott Laboratories competes with other large healthcare companies such as Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' robust product pipeline is expected to drive growth in the coming years. The company is focused on developing innovative products that address unmet medical needs and improve patient outcomes. In addition to its core businesses, Abbott Laboratories is expanding into new markets and investing in digital health technologies.\n\nLike any company, Abbott Laboratories faces a range of risks and challenges. One of the most significant risks facing the company is regulatory uncertainty. Changes in regulatory requirements could impact the company's ability to bring products to market and could also increase the cost of doing business. Another risk facing the company is the threat of competitive pressures. The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and Abbott Laboratories faces competition from established companies and new entrants. Changes in consumer preferences could also impact the company's performance, particularly in the nutritional products segment.\n\nAdditionally, Abbott Laboratories is exposed to geopolitical risks, such as changes in trade policies or political instability in key markets. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations, which could impact its financial performance.",

Management further believes that measuring sales growth rates on an organic basis excluding COVID-19 tests is an appropriate way for investors to best understand underlying base business performance in 2024, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted to an endemic state, resulting in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests.\n\nNote: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 Results (4Q24)\n\nSales 4Q24 ($ in millions) Total Company\n\nNutrition\n\nDiagnostics\n\nEstablished\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nMedical Devices U.S. 4,341\n\n928\n\n1,055\n\n\u2014\n\n2,353 International 6,633\n\n1,201\n\n1,465\n\n1,268\n\n2,699 Total reported 10,974\n\n2,129\n\n2,520\n\n1,268\n\n5,052\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Change vs. 4Q23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. 10.0\n\n8.0\n\n3.5\n\nn/a\n\n14.0 International 5.4\n\n2.0\n\n(3.4)\n\n3.8\n\n13.5 Total reported 7.2\n\n4.5\n\n(0.6)\n\n3.8\n\n13.7 Impact of foreign exchange (1.4)\n\n(1.7)\n\n(1.6)\n\n(4.7)\n\n(0.3) Impact of business exit* (0.2)\n\n(0.9)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 Organic 8.8\n\n7.1\n\n1.0\n\n8.5\n\n14.0 Impact of COVID-19 testing sales (3) (1.3)\n\n\u2014\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 Organic (excluding COVID-19 tests) 10.1\n\n7.1\n\n6.1\n\n8.5\n\n14.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. 13.5\n\n10.0\n\n15.9\n\nn/a\n\n14.0 International 8.1\n\n4.9\n\n0.8\n\n8.5\n\n14.0\n\nFull-Year 2024 Results (12M24)\n\nSales 12M24 ($ in millions) Total Company\n\nNutrition\n\nDiagnostics\n\nEstablished\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nMedical Devices U.S. 16,323\n\n3,689\n\n3,830\n\n\u2014\n\n8,788 International 25,627\n\n4,724\n\n5,511\n\n5,194\n\n10,198 Total reported 41,950\n\n8,413\n\n9,341\n\n5,194\n\n18,986\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Change vs. 12M23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. 5.6\n\n8.1\n\n(11.5)\n\nn/a\n\n14.2 International 3.9\n\n(0.4)\n\n(2.6)\n\n2.5\n\n11.0 Total reported 4.6\n\n3.2\n\n(6.5)\n\n2.5\n\n12.4 Impact of foreign exchange (2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.6)\n\n(6.7)\n\n(1.3) Impact of business exit and acquisition* 0.1\n\n(0.5)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n0.3 Organic 7.1\n\n6.4\n\n(3.9)\n\n9.2\n\n13.4 Impact of COVID-19 testing sales (3) (2.5)\n\n\u2014\n\n(9.1)\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 Organic (excluding COVID-19 tests) 9.6\n\n6.4\n\n5.2\n\n9.2\n\n13.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. 10.9\n\n9.2\n\n6.3\n\nn/a\n\n13.5 International 8.8\n\n4.4\n\n4.5\n\n9.2\n\n13.3\n\nRefer to table titled \"Non-GAAP Revenue Reconciliation\" for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue to reported revenue.\n\n*Quarter to date Dec. 31, 2024, reflects the impact of discontinuing the ZonePerfect\u00ae product line in the Nutrition business in March 2024.

The company also projects $5.05 to $5.25 in adjusted earnings per share, bracketing the Street's projection for $5.16.\n\nShe expects \"this outlook reflects the typical Q1 cadence of seasonally stronger spending as well as greater Fx headwinds than currently modeled by the Street,\" she said. \"While ABT shares may trade off this morning on the headline results, we think the underlying strength in Device sales and ability to offset Fx pressures on the P&L is notable.\"\n\nAbbott stock rose 0.9% to 117.78.\n\nAbbott Stock Earnings: Double-Digit Sales Growth\n\nEdward Jones analyst John Boylan described the quarter as \"middling,\" noting fourth-quarter sales from the nutrition, diagnostic and pharma divisions all missed expectations. Exchange rates likely had a role to play in the lagging sales, he said in a client note.\n\nSales of medical devices \"did better than the consensus view, but not by a large amount,\" he said. Medical devices, Abbott's biggest business segment, grew 14% to $5.05 billion. Analysts projected a slightly lower $4.97 billion. But that included 20.6% sales growth for Abbott's diabetes devices.\n\nNotably, sales of Abbott's continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, surged 22.8%. Abbott is known best for its Freestyle Libre, which monitors glucose levels for people with diabetes. But the company also recently launched its Lingo device in the U.S. Lingo is tailored for people who don't have diabetes, but want to know more about their metabolic health.\n\nAcross all products, sales grew 10.1% organically, excluding the impact of Covid test sales. Abbott generated $10.97 billion in sales, below forecasts for $11.03 billion, according to FactSet. The firm earned an adjusted $1.34 per share, meeting expectations and up 12.6% year over year.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWalgreens Reverses 40% Sprint As DOJ Slams Opioid Prescriptions\n\nEvolus, An AbbVie And Botox Rival, Just Hit The Stratosphere \u2014 Here's Why\n\nFind Today's Best Growth Stocks To Watch With IBD 50\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Saudi Arabia IVD Market by Test Types, Products, Application, Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian in vitro diagnostics market size is forecast to reach US$1.68 billion by 2033. Meanwhile, its share in 2024 stood at US$1.15 billion and is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.30% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nThe rise in this market is caused by enhanced investment in healthcare, technological innovations in diagnostic equipment, as well as the demand for earlier disease diagnosis. Expanding infrastructure in healthcare and a shift in more personalized medicine enhance the overall growth of this market within the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IVD market in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly due to increasing healthcare needs and advancements in medical technology. IVD is critical in disease prevention, early detection, and personalized treatment. For example, diagnostic tests for diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases are commonly used in healthcare facilities nationwide. The Saudi government's investment in healthcare infrastructure and its Vision 2030 plan, which aims to improve healthcare services, is driving the adoption of advanced IVD technologies, ensuring more efficient and accurate diagnostics.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers in the Saudi Arabian IVD Market\n\nIncreasing Healthcare Investments and Infrastructure Development\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's ongoing healthcare reforms, driven by its Vision 2030 plan, are a key factor fueling the growth of the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market. The government has made huge investments in healthcare infrastructure, with new hospitals, diagnostic centers, and research facilities. These expansions have increased the demand for advanced diagnostic technologies, such as IVD devices.\n\nAs the number of healthcare institutions focused on modern diagnostic solutions grows, the demand for accurate, reliable, and timely IVD testing has increased, which has led to an expansion of the market in the region. Saudi Arabia accounts for 60 percent of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries' healthcare expenditure and ranks as a priority in spending for the Saudi Arabian Government. In 2023, it will commit an amount of $50.4 billion to health care and social development - that represents 16.96 percent of its 2023 budget and is the second most-expensive line item in budget after education.\n\n\n\nGrowing incidence of Chronic Diseases\n\n\n\nThe rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer in Saudi Arabia is a strong growth driver for the IVD market. These conditions are constantly monitored and diagnosed at an early stage, which in vitro diagnostics enables. With an aging population and lifestyle-related diseases on the rise, there will be a corresponding increase in the demand for diagnostic tests to manage these conditions. This increase in chronic diseases promotes the use of IVD technologies for screening, early diagnosis, and disease management.\n\n\n\nTechnological Advancements and Innovation in IVD Products\n\n\n\nAdvancements in IVD products, including molecular diagnostics, point-of-care testing, and automation, are significantly changing the Saudi Arabian market.

Due to this, there is a requirement for more affordable, locally manufactured IVD products in order to increase market reach and accessibility.\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nSaudi Arabia ELISA and CLIA Tests Market ELISA and CLIA tests are well-positioned for growth in the Saudi Arabia IVD market. Due to the increased prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases, there is a growing need for novel diagnostic solutions. Because of their high sensitivity and specificity, these tests are essential for disease detection and monitoring. In addition, the Saudi Arabia IVD market is driven by increased healthcare expenditure, technological advancements, and the development of healthcare infrastructure, which are factors that lead to the adoption of ELISA and CLIA tests.\n\nSaudi Arabia Instrument Offerings IVD Market The Saudi Arabia IVD market saw an increase in instrument products. Increasing healthcare spending, the rising incidence of chronic diseases, and the growing elderly population drive demand for advanced diagnostic solutions. Instruments, which include immunoassay analyzers, molecular diagnostic units, and point-of-care testing devices, are prominent for their accuracy and performance in ailment detection. Also, government projects to improve healthcare infrastructure and provide early illness analysis contribute to expanding instruments in the Saudi Arabia IVD market.\n\nSaudi Arabia Clinical Chemistry Market The market is anticipated to enjoy a surge in clinical chemistry. With a developing burden of chronic illnesses like diabetes and cardiovascular issues, demand rises for diagnostic checks to display the patient's health. Clinical chemistry analyzers are pivotal in assessing diverse biomarkers, aiding disorder diagnosis and treatment tracking. Moreover, technological advancements enhance the accuracy and performance of those analyzers, further fueling their adoption in the Saudi Arabia IVD market.\n\n\n\nKey Players\n\n\n\nRoche Diagnostics, Danaher Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Sysmex, Becton and Biomerieux are key players active in the Saudi Arabian IVD Market.\n\n\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 130 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.15 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $1.68 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.3% Regions Covered Saudi Arabia\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Abbott Laboratories is a global healthcare company specializing in developing, manufacturing and marketing a wide range of healthcare products. The company has its headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois and operates in more than 160 countries worldwide.\n\nThe company was founded in 1888 by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott, and it has since grown to become one of the world's largest and most respected healthcare companies. Abbott Laboratories has a diverse portfolio of products, including medical devices, diagnostic tests, nutritional products, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The company is committed to developing innovative products that improve the quality of life for people worldwide.\n\nRobert B. Ford is the current President and CEO of the company. He was appointed to this position in 2020 after serving as the company's Chief Operating Officer. He has been with Abbott Laboratories since 1996 and has held various leadership positions.\n\nAbbott Laboratories has delivered strong financial performance, declining as investors seek growth. The company's net earnings have been increasing steadily. Abbott Laboratories has a solid balance sheet with a low debt-to-equity ratio. The company has consistently delivered strong cash flow, allowing it to invest in research and development and return value to shareholders. Abbott Laboratories has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than the industry average, and the company's price-to-book ratio is also higher than the industry average. These metrics suggest that the market has a positive outlook on Abbott Laboratories and is willing to pay a premium for the company's shares. Over the past year, Abbott Laboratories' stock has declined as consumers seek to see what the company will do post-pandemic. The company's shares have experienced some volatility, but overall, they have outperformed the broader market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories operates in the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and complex. The industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, changing regulatory requirements, and shifting consumer preferences. Abbott Laboratories competes with other large healthcare companies such as Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' robust product pipeline is expected to drive growth in the coming years. The company is focused on developing innovative products that address unmet medical needs and improve patient outcomes. In addition to its core businesses, Abbott Laboratories is expanding into new markets and investing in digital health technologies.\n\nLike any company, Abbott Laboratories faces a range of risks and challenges. One of the most significant risks facing the company is regulatory uncertainty. Changes in regulatory requirements could impact the company's ability to bring products to market and could also increase the cost of doing business. Another risk facing the company is the threat of competitive pressures. The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and Abbott Laboratories faces competition from established companies and new entrants. Changes in consumer preferences could also impact the company's performance, particularly in the nutritional products segment.\n\nAdditionally, Abbott Laboratories is exposed to geopolitical risks, such as changes in trade policies or political instability in key markets. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations, which could impact its financial performance.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"United States Anesthesia Drugs Market by Type by General Inhalation by General Intravenous by Local, and Company Analysis 2025 to 2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe United States anesthesia drugs market is expected to reach from US$ 2.61 billion in 2024 to US$ 3.67 billion in 2033 with a compound annual growth rate of 3.86% from 2025 to 2033. More surgeries, development in technologies of anesthesia, and enhanced safety and comfort for the patient are factors behind such a growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnesthesia drugs are also commonly used in various settings within the United States' healthcare systems. These settings include hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, dental offices, and many more. Their applications include surgery, diagnostic procedures, labor and delivery, and pain management. Drugs include propofol, sevoflurane, and lidocaine; the type of anesthesia depends upon the drugs. In the US, with advanced medical technologies, there is emphasis given to the safety, efficacy, and recovery time that go along with the drugs during anesthesia.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Surgical Procedure\n\n\n\nThe high rate of surgical procedures in the U.S. contributes significantly to the growth of the anesthesia drugs market. In the United States, every year, about 15 million people undergo surgery. These include an increase in surgeries that are elective or emergency-type surgeries, especially orthopedic, cardiovascular, or cosmetic surgeries, which occur due to a growing proportion of older-aged populations, thus raising a demand in anesthesia drugs to maintain painlessness and safety among patients receiving such procedures.\n\nAdditionally, sedation anesthesia-based minimally invasive surgeries are increasingly being performed, thus increasing the demand for specialized drugs in anesthesia. For example, in September 2023, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons reported that 26.2 million surgical procedures are available in the U.S.\n\n\n\nAnesthesia Drug Formulations Development\n\n\n\nThe growth of the market is also driven by the development of anesthesia drug formulations. Healthcare providers increasingly prefer new and improved anesthesia agents that provide faster recovery times, fewer side effects, and better patient outcomes. Drugs such as propofol and sevoflurane have gained popularity due to their efficiency and safety profiles.\n\nAdditionally, innovations in local anesthetics for targeted pain management are expanding their use in outpatient surgeries and procedures. These advancements lead to greater demand for modern anesthesia drugs for better patient experiences and clinical results. For example, on April 2024, Baxter launched Ropivacaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP, extending its pharmaceutical portfolio in the U.S. This prefilled, single-dose infusion bag is indicated for administration of local or regional anesthesia during surgery and for relief of acute pain in adults, thereby improving product line and competitive position.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Emphasis on Patient Safety and Comfort\n\n\n\nAs patient safety and comfort become more prioritized in medical care, the demand for safer and more effective anesthesia drugs is increasing. Healthcare providers focus on minimizing adverse effects such as postoperative nausea, dizziness, and prolonged recovery times. Anesthesia drugs that offer better control over anesthesia depth, faster onset, and quicker recovery are highly sought. Patient-centered care initiatives in the U.S. have been pushing for individualized anesthesia approaches, hence the development and adoption of drugs that would provide optimal safety while ensuring patient comfort during and after procedures.\n\n\n\nGovernment Policy\n\n\n\nGovernment initiatives and health reforms play a significant role in defining the U.S. market for general anesthesia drugs. A great deal of investments from the federal government has been into health infrastructure and funding surgical procedures, which increased demand for anesthesia. Various types of surgical procedures covered by Medicare and Medicaid increase surgeries that require general anesthesia and subsequently increase the demand for the general anesthesia drugs.\n\n\n\nThis area of research emphasizes improving surgery outcome and patient safety, stimulating advanced anesthesia techniques and pharmaceutical products. The current innovations relate to the creation of safe, innovative, and user-friendly anesthetic delivery devices and agents. Modern anesthesia drugs provide a better-controlled effect duration and depth to assure quick recovery time and maximal safety for the patient.\n\n\n\nHealthcare reforms, government initiatives, and technological advancements are all crucial for the growth of the general anesthesia drugs market in the United States. Ongoing concern for patient safety and surgery effectiveness promotes the adoption of the latest drugs and anesthesia practices.\n\n\n\nRegulatory bodies, especially the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly anesthetics. The FDA's rigorous approval process ensures that only safe and effective anesthetic drugs are available. These regulatory guidelines influence various aspects of drug development, including labeling, dosage recommendations, and clinical trial requirements, all essential for the responsible application of anesthetic agents.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 120 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $2.61 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $3.67 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 3.8% Regions Covered United States\n\n\n\nCompany Analysis:\n\nBaxter International Inc\n\nAbbvie\n\nMedtronic Plc\n\nDraegerwerk AG\n\nKoninklijke Philips NV\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "When most of us think of investing in stocks, we think of the potential gains -- or unfortunately, in some cases, losses -- that might follow. A particular stock will rise or fall, and we'll benefit or lose. But, fortunately, a particular type of stock could make you a winner year after year, regardless of its performance or the performance of the stock market as a whole.\n\nI'm talking about the dividend stock. These players offer you passive income, something that will limit your losses in difficult markets and further boost your gains during good times. And you don't even have to lift a finger to benefit from these regular payments. You just have to own shares of companies committed to rewarding shareholders this way.\n\nEven if a company offers a dividend now, though, how can you be sure that will continue? There's no way to know with 100% certainty what a company will do several years down the road. But it's reasonable to be confident in companies that have a long track record of dividend growth -- showing their commitment to these payments -- and solid free cash flow -- showing their ability to make these payments.\n\nLet's check out two dividend stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ 1.64%) is a Dividend King, meaning it's increased its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years. In fact, J&J actually has lifted its dividend for more than 60 years, and today pays an annual dividend of $4.96, representing a dividend yield of 3.3%. That's higher than the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) yield of 1.2%. And with free cash flow of $19 billion, the company has the financial strength to keep these payments going.\n\nIt's also worth owning J&J stock for its earnings potential moving forward. The company divested its consumer health unit in 2023, and now is focused exclusively on its pharmaceuticals and medtech businesses -- the units offering it the most potential for growth.\n\nIn the third-quarter earnings report, J&J reported more than 6% growth for each of these businesses, and total sales climbed more than 5%. The company's pharma business -- known as innovative medicine -- boasts 11 major brands that are growing in the double digits. And the business reported a second straight quarter of revenue topping $14 billion.\n\nAs for medtech, J&J is transitioning into the highest-growth markets, and acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed have helped make this happen. Thanks to these purchases, J&J now is category leader in four of the top cardiovascular intervention markets.\n\nSo J&J's track record of dividend growth and its exciting new revenue prospects following the consumer health exit make it a great stock to get in on right now.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT 1.31%), like J&J, has a proven track record of dividend growth and has a spot on the Dividend Kings list. The company pays an annual dividend of $2.36, representing a dividend yield of about 2%. And this is another player that, with free cash flow of $6.4 billion, has the ability to continue along this path.\n\n\"I've talked about the importance of the dividend and supporting that growing dividend, and we'll continue to do that,\" CEO Robert Ford said during the third-quarter earnings call. And Abbott's board recently approved a $7 billion buyback program, another move to reward shareholders.\n\nAlso, like J&J, Abbott makes a quality healthcare addition to your portfolio -- one that's built a solid earnings track record and has more to offer over the long term, too.\n\nI particularly appreciate Abbott's diversified portfolio, including diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals businesses. This range of businesses ensures a certain stability in the earnings picture over time -- if, during a particular period, one unit suffers, another unit may compensate.\n\nThis has been the case recently, in the third quarter.

The expanding healthcare infrastructure, combined with increasing demand for healthcare services and products, presents growth opportunities for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nDemand\n\nThe demand for pharmaceuticals is influenced by various factors such as ageing populations, increasing healthcare spending and disease prevalence. Assess both current and future demand for pharma stocks to understand their potential growth opportunities.\n\nCompetition and Mergers\n\nThe pharma industry is highly competitive, and companies may engage in mergers and acquisitions to stay ahead. To understand how strong a company is, look at where it stands in the market, and its growth and check if its stock prices have changed recently.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nPharmaceutical companies heavily rely on research and development (R&D) to create new drugs and treatments. You must evaluate a company's R&D investments and pipeline to ensure they are focusing on the right areas and have promising new products in development.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulations and government policies, which can impact a company's ability to introduce new products. Therefore, you should stay updated with the regulatory changes that could affect the industry and individual companies.\n\nShould You Invest in Pharma Stocks?\n\nWhile pharmaceutical stocks offer steady returns and growth potential, driven by factors like increasing demand and rising insurance penetration, it is essential to recognise the associated risks.\n\nRegulatory changes, particularly in pricing and exports, have the potential to impact company revenues significantly. The US market, pivotal for many pharmaceutical firms, faces regulatory pressures and FDA inspections that could adversely affect stock performance. Additionally, currency fluctuations pose a risk, given the industry's reliance on exports.\n\nDespite these challenges, pharmaceutical companies are focusing on growth areas and making substantial investments in research and development. However, before buying top pharma shares, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvesting in pharma sector stocks might present stable returns and growth prospects, provided that thorough due diligence has been conducted before investment. If you find conducting independent research challenging, seeking guidance and advice tailored to your investment objectives from a financial expert is in your best interest.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently emphasized the importance of long-term investing, urging investors to focus on the growth prospects of certain pharmaceutical stocks while also answering callers\u2019 questions about certain stocks. Cramer acknowledged that stocks often experience cyclical trends, with some sectors falling out of favor temporarily.\n\n\u201cLook, stocks go in and out of style in the Wall Street fashion show. Whole sectors wallow at times. Right now, healthcare\u2019s in some sort of doghouse the likes of which I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks\n\nDespite the industry\u2019s struggles, Cramer reflected on his observations at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, where he saw many pharmaceutical companies that he believes are not being properly valued by Wall Street. While the present outlook for these companies may not be particularly stellar, he highlighted the strong and lucrative long-term potential they offer.\n\n\u201cWhy am I so willing to focus on the so-called out years? Because the long-term possibilities for these companies, frankly, they're incredible and by the way, incredibly lucrative too, even as the present is good, but not great.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the ongoing progress in the healthcare sector, particularly with GLP-1 drugs, which have the potential to treat more conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss. Additionally, companies are working on developing oral versions of these treatments, which could offer patients more convenient options. Beyond GLP-1 drugs, healthcare companies are expanding their portfolios with new cancer therapies, treatments for eye care and asthma, and experimental drugs for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: Ask yourself what happens if things get better, please. What if the future is brighter than the past? If that\u2019s the case, and I think it is, then you\u2019ll have a lot of winners with these drug and medical device plays.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Understanding Abbott Laboratories in Today\u2019s Market\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has caught the eye of many investors, especially those following Jim Cramer\u2019s insights. Despite facing significant legal challenges, Cramer firmly believes the company has remarkable long-term growth potential that Wall Street may be overlooking.\n\nCramer, who hosts the popular investment show Mad Money, stresses the importance of focusing on long-term growth rather than current market dips. He has noted that whole sectors, such as healthcare, can endure tough times but hints at a resurgence driven by innovations in pharmaceutical solutions.\n\nAbbott is particularly noteworthy as it develops a variety of healthcare solutions, thereby enhancing its diversified portfolio. Recent controversies surrounding its infant formula have led to a series of lawsuits, yet Cramer is optimistic about the company\u2019s likelihood of overcoming these obstacles. Following a recent favorable jury ruling, industry analysts suggest that Abbott\u2019s future prospects might be improving, which could pave the way for more stable growth.\n\nWhile Abbott Laboratories ranks third on Cramer\u2019s stock watchlist, he\u2019s excited about other companies in emerging fields like AI, hinting at potentially higher returns in those sectors.\n\nInvestors looking for a balanced approach might find Abbott an intriguing option, especially against the backdrop of its recent legal victories and ongoing innovations.

As they adapt their strategies to include digital health technologies, the wider community can benefit from improved access to essential healthcare services. With healthcare becoming a focal point for global economies, Abbott\u2019s performance may reflect broader economic indicators, potentially fostering stability in uncertain times.\n\nOn the environmental front, Abbott\u2019s future strategies must also account for sustainability. As pressures mount for companies to operate within environmentally friendly frameworks, Abbott has the opportunity to lead in this realm by prioritizing green practices in manufacturing and distribution. Long-term, the focus on sustainable innovation could not only improve their market position but also contribute positively to global environmental goals.\n\nThus, as Abbott navigates its current challenges and opportunities, it is poised to influence not only shareholder returns but also the health and welfare of populations worldwide, all while potentially shaping emerging trends in corporate responsibility and environmental stewardship.\n\nUnlocking the Future of Abbott Laboratories: A Deep Dive into Its Market Potential\n\nIntroduction to Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has emerged as a significant player in the healthcare sector, garnering attention from investors for its innovative solutions and resilient business model. Despite facing legal hurdles, the company\u2019s prospects remain bright, especially in light of recent favorable developments.\n\nInnovations and Growth Potential\n\nAbbott\u2019s emphasis on research and development positions it advantageously, as the company continually seeks to broaden its product offerings. With a diverse portfolio that includes diagnostics, medical devices, and nutritional products, Abbott is well-poised to adapt to market demands. For instance, the recent advancements in its diabetes management products reflect the company\u2019s commitment to addressing critical healthcare needs.\n\nLegal Challenges: Overcoming Controversies\n\nAlthough Abbott has faced controversies, particularly surrounding their infant formula products that resulted in lawsuits, the company has made strides in overcoming these challenges. A recent favorable jury ruling supports Cramer\u2019s belief that Abbott can navigate past its legal issues and refocus on growth strategies.\n\nMarket Analysis: Investor Insights\n\nAccording to analysts, Abbott ranks prominently among healthcare stocks due to its robust financial health and strategic position within the market. With a focus on long-term growth, investors may find Abbott a stable choice in an unpredictable stock environment. Moreover, the healthcare sector as a whole is projected to rebound, driven by innovations and rising healthcare demand, further enhancing Abbott\u2019s investment appeal.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Abbott Laboratories\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong product diversification across various healthcare segments.\n\n\u2013 Recent legal victories improving investor sentiment.\n\n\u2013 Ongoing innovations leading to new market opportunities.\n\n\u2013 Stability in a recovering healthcare sector.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Existing legal issues may resurface and impact investor confidence.\n\n\u2013 Competition from emerging technologies and players in the healthcare space.\n\nFuture Trends: What to Watch For\n\nAbbott\u2019s future growth may be influenced by several key trends:\n\n1.

            "content": "Market Overview: Momentum Building on Wall Street\n\nAs the week comes to a close, Wall Street shows promising signs, with stock indexes expected to finish strong. The S&P 500 is on course for a remarkable weekly gain, a performance not witnessed since before the elections. Recent discontent regarding inflation and rising interest rates was sparked by a strong jobs report, hinting that the Federal Reserve may consider future interest rate hikes. However, the market\u2019s mood shifted dramatically following two unexpected, cooler-than-anticipated inflation reports. This relief helped drive stocks upward and caused the 10-year Treasury yield to drop.\n\nSector Highlights: Cyclicals Take Center Stage\n\nMarket leaders this week included cyclical sectors such as materials and financials. Notable performers were companies like DuPont and Linde, both exceeding the broader market\u2019s gains. DuPont updated its timeline for business restructuring favorably, and ratings upgrades contributed to its positive momentum. Financial giants BlackRock and Goldman Sachs surged following strong earnings reports, with Goldman attaining record-high shares.\n\nChallenges for Defensive Stocks\n\nWhile cyclicals thrived, defensive sectors fell behind, struggling to generate interest. Health care stocks, particularly Eli Lilly, faced setbacks due to sales figures that didn\u2019t meet expectations, while staples like Costco showed modest gains.\n\nLooking Ahead: Key Earnings on the Horizon\n\nNext week, despite the market closure for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a wave of earnings reports is set to arrive, featuring major companies such as 3M and Netflix. Stay tuned for updates, as Abbott Laboratories prepares to share its earnings before the market opens.\n\nMarket Trends and Societal Implications\n\nAs Wall Street experiences a resurgence, the implications extend beyond immediate market valuations, reflecting deeper ripples through society and culture. A robust stock market bolsters consumer confidence, often leading to increased spending. This uptick in expenditure can accelerate economic growth, fostering job creation and wage increases, which are essential for enhancing the living standards of everyday Americans. In turn, this phenomenon may shift societal attitudes toward investment and financial literacy, emphasizing the importance of a stable economic environment in cultivating a prosperous demographic.\n\nHowever, while these trends appear beneficial, they raise concerns about income inequality. Stock market gains predominantly benefit those already invested, potentially widening the wealth gap. Those without investments may feel further marginalized, fueling discontent and societal tension.\n\nMoreover, the environmental implications of cyclical sectors, particularly materials and financials, cannot be overlooked. Companies in these sectors must balance profit with sustainable practices. As investors increasingly prioritize Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, firms that neglect sustainability may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAs we look ahead, current trends suggest a continued focus on long-term resilience in the economy. Investors are likely to demand more accountability from corporations regarding their environmental impact and social governance, shaping future corporate strategies for sustainable growth. Thus, the intersection of market performance and societal expectations will remain a critical point of discourse in the coming years.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Resilience: What Investors Need to Know\n\nMarket Analysis: Wall Street\u2019s Strong Finish\n\nAs the current week approaches its conclusion, Wall Street demonstrates promising resilience, with stock indexes poised for a robust finish. The S&P 500, in particular, is set to record a noteworthy weekly gain, marking the best performance since pre-elections. This surge follows a series of financial reports that indicate a potential pivot point for investors concerned about inflation and escalating interest rates following a strong jobs report. However, the mood of the market shifted after the release of two unexpectedly low inflation reports, which eased fears and propelled stock values upward while simultaneously causing the 10-year Treasury yield to decrease.\n\nSector Performance: Cyclicals Shine Amid Challenges\n\nThis week\u2019s standout performers have been cyclical sectors, notably including materials and financial services. Companies such as DuPont and Linde have outperformed the market, with DuPont releasing an updated, positive timeline for its business restructuring. Additionally, upgrades in ratings have fueled its upward momentum. On the financial front, institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs have seen significant boosts following the announcement of strong earnings, with Goldman hitting record-high share prices.\n\nPros and Cons of Cyclical Stocks\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Potential for high returns in a recovering economy\n\n\u2013 Strong earnings reports indicate positive growth outlook\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Increased volatility compared to defensive sectors\n\n\u2013 Susceptibility to economic downturns\n\nDefensive Sector Struggles\n\nIn contrast, defensive sectors appear to be lagging, with companies struggling to maintain investor interest. Health care stocks, particularly Eli Lilly, faced setbacks due to disappointing sales figures, while staples like Costco managed only modest gains. The divergence in performance highlights the market\u2019s current preference for cyclical growth over defensive plays, underscoring the challenges faced by traditionally stable sectors in such an environment.\n\nLooking Ahead: Earnings Reports That Matter\n\nInvestors should prepare for a significant week ahead, despite the market closure for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. A slew of crucial earnings reports from major corporations is on the horizon, including anticipated releases from 3M, Netflix, and Abbott Laboratories, which is set to report its earnings before the market opens. This wave of earnings is expected to provide further insights into market trends and potential shifts in investor sentiment.\n\nTrends and Innovations in the Market\n\nThe resilience of Wall Street, illustrated by the recent performance of cyclical sectors, underscores a notable trend: a gradual recovery and optimism about economic conditions despite worries about inflation. This shift suggests that investors are beginning to favor growth-oriented stocks as indicators of future economic health improve.\n\nSecurity Considerations for Investors\n\nAs the market landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for investors to remain vigilant regarding security aspects associated with stock trading. Understanding market volatility and the implications of economic reports can help mitigate potential risks. Engaging with financial advisors or utilizing reliable trading platforms can enhance portfolio security and strategy.\n\nFor more insights and updates on market trends, visit MarketWatch.",

Jeff grew up in Weatherly, Pennsylvania and was a 2008 graduate of Weatherly Area High School. He then continued his education at Lock Haven University, majoring in Sports Management and Administration. Following his graduation in 2012, he pursued his career in sports working in sales for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Columbus Blue Jackets. After leaving the sports industry, Jeff moved onto medical sales and most recently worked for Abbott Laboratories in Wisconsin.\n\nJeff is survived by his wife, Ashley; his children, Reagan and Carter; his mother, Linda (McGee) Lesko; his brothers, Jared Lesko and Zachary Lesko; and paternal grandmother, Mary Ellen Lesko.. He is also survived by his nephews, Kameron, Ryley, and Jaxon Jacoby, with whom he shared a close bond, as well as his in-laws, many aunts, uncles and cousins and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, John P. Lesko Jr., his paternal grandfather, John P. Lesko and his maternal grandparents, John P. McGee Sr. and Shirley (Sharpe) McGee.\n\nJeff had a remarkable ability to make friends wherever he went, and all who knew him will remember his boundless curiosity, warmth, and zest for life. He loved spending time outdoors in the summer, completing intricate LEGO villages with his kids, and cheering for Penn State.\n\n\n\nHis natural curiosity drew him to learn about people and places, and his genuine interest in everyone he met, left a lasting impression. Jeff had an adventurous spirit and a love for travel, attending countless Dave Matthews Band concerts, and bringing friends together to watch the game or simply enjoy each other\u2019s company.

The company is committed to developing innovative products that improve the quality of life for people worldwide.\n\nRobert B. Ford is the current President and CEO of the company. He was appointed to this position in 2020 after serving as the company's Chief Operating Officer. He has been with Abbott Laboratories since 1996 and has held various leadership positions.\n\nAbbott Laboratories has delivered strong financial performance, declining as investors seek growth. The company's net earnings have been increasing steadily. Abbott Laboratories has a solid balance sheet with a low debt-to-equity ratio. The company has consistently delivered strong cash flow, allowing it to invest in research and development and return value to shareholders. Abbott Laboratories has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than the industry average, and the company's price-to-book ratio is also higher than the industry average. These metrics suggest that the market has a positive outlook on Abbott Laboratories and is willing to pay a premium for the company's shares. Over the past year, Abbott Laboratories' stock has declined as consumers seek to see what the company will do post-pandemic. The company's shares have experienced some volatility, but overall, they have outperformed the broader market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories operates in the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and complex. The industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, changing regulatory requirements, and shifting consumer preferences. Abbott Laboratories competes with other large healthcare companies such as Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAbbott Laboratories' robust product pipeline is expected to drive growth in the coming years. The company is focused on developing innovative products that address unmet medical needs and improve patient outcomes. In addition to its core businesses, Abbott Laboratories is expanding into new markets and investing in digital health technologies.\n\nLike any company, Abbott Laboratories faces a range of risks and challenges. One of the most significant risks facing the company is regulatory uncertainty. Changes in regulatory requirements could impact the company's ability to bring products to market and could also increase the cost of doing business. Another risk facing the company is the threat of competitive pressures. The healthcare industry is highly competitive, and Abbott Laboratories faces competition from established companies and new entrants. Changes in consumer preferences could also impact the company's performance, particularly in the nutritional products segment.\n\nAdditionally, Abbott Laboratories is exposed to geopolitical risks, such as changes in trade policies or political instability in key markets. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations, which could impact its financial performance.",

Revenues are projected to reach $11.02 billion, increasing 7.6% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Abbott metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net sales- Medical Devices- Rhythm Management- Total' should come in at $623.50 million. The estimate suggests a change of +7.1% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Net sales- Medical Devices- Diabetes Care' will reach $1.82 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +17.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net sales- Established Pharmaceuticals' should arrive at $1.31 billion. The estimate points to a change of +6.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net sales- Diagnostics' of $2.57 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Net sales- Diagnostics- U.S.' to come in at $1.03 billion. The estimate points to a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net sales- Diagnostics- International' to reach $1.54 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net sales- Nutrition- International' will reach $1.21 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Net sales- Nutrition- U.S.' stands at $942.92 million. The estimate points to a change of +9.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues",

Ltd.\u2019s Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and store-brand heartburn pills from Costco Wholesale Corp. and Rite Aid Corp.\n\nThe dye is common in U.S. supermarkets. About 26% of baking decorations and dessert toppings have the dye, according to an analysis of October data performed by healthy food app GoCoCo.\n\nIt\u2019s also found in 16% of chewing gum and mints, 13% of candy, and 11% of cookies and biscuits. Red No. 3 is found in cereals, candy, juice, and frozen desserts, and is responsible for the bright red color seen in products like Skittles, Trix cereal, and more. It\u2019s also in a number of dietary supplements and drugs like cough syrups.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a food industry group, and the National Confectioners Association, a candy-focused trade organization, both said companies would comply with the ban.\n\n\u201cOur consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework,\u201d the candy group said in a statement. \u201cFDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.\u201d\n\nSome food and drug makers have already begun switching to other types of dyes such as beet juice and carmine, which comes from ground insects.\n\nThe only foods in the European Union that can use Red No. 3, known as erythrosin there, are cocktail and candied cherries.\n\nThe dye is known as FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\u201d said Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d\n\nFood manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.\n\nWhen the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \u201cthe FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.\n\nHealth advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.\n\n--Bloomberg and Tribune News Service contributed",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues",

Abbott is a leading employer and medical manufacturer in town.\n\nBill Gillespie, chairman of the Altavista Economic Development Authority, said this facility is an exciting addition to the town.\n\nIn economic development, nothing happens today, it's always in the future. The problem is, you've got to be able to see it and have enough faith. This community is great, and Abbott will tell you that,\" Gillespie said.\n\nGillespie said the AEDA worked for years to bring the project to fruition.\n\n\"We started working with Abbott about two and a half years ago. They really liked the Altavista location for a distribution center. The issue was that we really didn't have a site that was big enough, because they wanted a site that could house a 400,000-square-foot distribution center; that's a big building,\" Gillespie said.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nThe AEDA acquired an 83-acre parcel of land on Dearing Ford Rd. in 2021. They're conveying that land, assessed at $414,600, to Becknell to build the facility, which will be used by Abbott.\n\n\"Abbott is primarily focused on manufacturing, they're not interested in owning buildings, land or property, they want to focus on manufacturing,\" Gillespie said.\n\nGillespie said he's optimistic that the facility will continue economic growth in the town.\n\nWe're taking a little bit more of a futuristic look at this and saying that this is just step one of where we could be at,\" he said. \"Abbott's been here since the '70s. They're not going anywhere if we've got anything to do with it. I think all of the EDA could see that. They've been a good partner for all of these years, and this is a step in the right direction for us.\"\n\nThe facility will be located on Dearing Ford Road. Construction is slated to begin as soon as possible, with a goal to have the center operational by June 30, 2026.\n\nto read more about this plan for economic growth.",

The settlement comes just weeks before the case was set to go to trial, with a federal court in Illinois announcing the cancellation of the jury trial and pretrial conference scheduled for February 2025 and January 2025, respectively.\n\nThe dispute revolves around U.S. Patent No. 7,205,101, granted to Novartis in 2007, which Abbott contested in 2019 by alleging the patent\u2019s invalidity. Abbott argued that the patent covered only a conventional laboratory procedure known at the time, but U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis rejected this claim in 2020, maintaining that the patent was valid and describing it as covering a specific process for replicating HIV DNA.\n\nSubsequently, Novartis and Grifols countered with their own suit, asserting that Abbott\u2019s HIV tests infringed on the patent. In 2023, Judge Ellis ruled that while some claims of the patent were invalid, two claims remained under scrutiny. A trial was set to determine the validity of these remaining claims in February.",

            "content": "Watch BNN Bloomberg live.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- US health officials banned the artificial food coloring Red No. 3, which has been linked to cancer and is currently in scores of products from candy to cold medicine.\n\nThe dye will no longer be allowed in US food starting Jan. 15, 2027, according to a Food and Drug Administration document posted online. Drugmakers who use the artificial coloring will have until Jan. 18, 2028 to reformulate their products, the agency said.\n\nRed No. 3 is used in foods such as Brach\u2019s candy corn from Ferrara Candy Co., Betty Crocker sprinkles from General Mills Inc. and strawberry Ensure from Abbott Laboratories. It is also found in drugs including Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.\u2019s Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and store-brand heartburn pills from Costco Wholesale Corp. and Rite Aid Corp.\n\nThe move comes more than 30 years since the Food and Drug Administration prohibited the use of Red No. 3 in cosmetics after studies found tumors linked to the dye in lab rats. Consumer and patient advocacy groups petitioned the agency in 2022 to revoke the use of the food coloring in American diets.\n\nThe FDA said the dye doesn\u2019t cause cancer in humans the same way it does in rats but under a provision known as the Delaney Clause, any additive that causes cancer in humans or animals is not allowed in food in the US.\n\n\u201cThe petitioners provided data demonstrating that this additive induces cancer in male rats,\u201d the FDA wrote in its notice Wednesday. Bloomberg previously reported the decision.\n\nOne of the proponents of banning controversial dyes is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t put it on your skin why would you eat it?\u201d said Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, in an interview last month. \u201cBright red dye is completely unessential. We don\u2019t need bright red candies.\u201d\n\nBirnbaum signed the petition to ban Red No. 3 in the US along with about 20 advocacy groups including Consumer Reports, Public Citizen and the Environmental Working Group.\n\nThe dye is common in US supermarkets. About 26% of baking decorations and dessert toppings have the dye, according to an analysis of October data performed by healthy food app GoCoCo. It\u2019s also found in 16% of chewing gum and mints, 13% of candy, and 11% of cookies and biscuits.\n\n\u201cRed Dye 3 poses an unacceptable risk to our health, especially when safer alternatives are readily available,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports. \u201cBy banning Red Dye 3, the FDA will protect the public by encouraging manufacturers to switch to safer ingredients already used in products sold in Europe and numerous other countries.\u201d\n\nThe industry should be ready to remove Red No. 3, said Peter Lurie, executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, which also signed the petition, in an interview last month. California banned Red No. 3 in foods in 2023, though companies have until 2027 to make the change.\n\nA spokesperson for General Mills said that the company will be in compliance with California\u2019s law when it takes effect. Ferrara has already begun reformulating products without Red No. 3 to align with consumer preferences, a spokesperson told Bloomberg.\n\nShares of General Mills and Abbott were little changed on Wednesday in New York.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a food industry group, and the National Confectioners Association, a candy-focused trade organization, both said companies would comply with the ban.\n\n\u201cOur consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework,\u201d the candy group said in a statement. \u201cFDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.\u201d\n\nRed No. 3 is one of a handful of dyes that have recently come under scrutiny by state legislatures. Lawmakers are weighing bans on Red No. 40, which has been associated with hyperactivity in children, as well as Yellow Nos. 5 and 6, Blue Nos. 1 and 2, and Green No. 3.\n\n\u201cRed 3 has no place in our food, especially in food marketed to our kids,\u201d said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at Environmental Working Group. \u201cNow, the FDA needs to take the next step and ban other dangerous chemicals lurking in our food.\u201d\n\nSome food and drug makers have already begun switching to other types of dyes such as carmine, which comes from ground insects.\n\nThe only foods in the European Union that can use Red No. 3, known as erythrosin there, are cocktail and candied cherries.\n\nThe EU has a more robust system to review food additives than the US does, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for human foods, told US senators during a hearing on industry tactics that have led millions of Americans to develop diabetes and obesity. Jones said the agency recently created an office to examine food chemicals that are on the market and is pushing Congress for more funding.\n\n(Updates with effective dates in second paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Labeled and displayed next to FDA-regulated infant formulas, toddler milk is being promoted as a healthy next stage in child nutrition, even as most experts recommend against its use.\n\nBOSTON, Jan. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) today announced that it has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) over the misleading marketing of its \"toddler milk\" products to the parents and caregivers of young children aged 12 to 36 months.\n\nAccording to the complaint, filed today, toddler milk is being deceptively marketed by Abbott as a natural and healthy next step after children outgrow FDA-regulated infant formulas. But toddler milk is not an FDA-regulated product; according to the lawsuit, it is essentially a marketing ploy by Abbott to keep parents and caregivers using Abbott products as their children age. Unlike FDA-regulated infant formulas, the lawsuit alleges, Abbott's \"toddler milk\" provides young children with added sugar that runs counter to well-established nutritional guidelines.\n\n\"Toddler milk,\" like FDA-regulated infant formulas, are milk powders with added nutrients, generally sold in the same size cans and tubs as FDA-regulated infant formulas. They are labeled similarly to FDA-regulated infant formulas and are sold on the same shelves in stores as FDA-regulated infant formulas, even though toddlers aged 12 to 36 months have different dietary needs from infants aged 0 to 12 months. Moreover, unlike FDA-regulated infant formulas, toddler milks are not regulated by the FDA.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges misleading labeling and marketing of two Abbott toddler milk products, \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink by Similac\" and \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink by Similac.\" The products are labeled \"Stage 3,\" implying they are the next nutritionally recommended product for purchase after infant formula, which is numbered \"Stage 1\" and transitional formula, which is numbered \"Stage 2.\"\n\nIn fact, toddler milk products are not nutritionally recommended at all. Most experts\u2014 including the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014recommend that children above twelve months be given healthy foods, water, and plain cow's milk, and that these products should not include the sorts of numerical steps that Abbott uses.\n\nThe new lawsuit seeks changes to Abbott's advertising and marketing practices, a return to consumers of money spent as a result of Abbott's fraudulent, unlawful and unfair marketing practices, as well as other remedies.\n\nA Growth Market\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that, to make up for declining sales of infant formulas, Abbott and other makers of infant formula introduced products marketed as \"transition formulas,\" \"follow-on formulas,\" \"weaning formulas,\" \"toddler milks\" and \"toddler drinks.\" Available market data shows that advertising spending on such products quadrupled between 2006 and 2015. Since 2018, the sales of toddler milk nationwide have averaged more than $500 million per year.\n\n\"Toddler milk is purposely marketed and labeled to look like infant formula,\" said Andrew Rainer of PHAI. \"It sits on shelves next to infant formula, and is promoted as the next stage in child nutrition\u2014all in an attempt to convince parents and caregivers to buy a product toddlers don't need.\"\n\n\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said Dr. George Fuchs, Professor of Pediatric Gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics who led the AAP report on toddler milks. \"Most of these products are filled with added sugars and/or have other nutritional inadequacies and lack proper nutritional balance. The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives.\"\n\n\"Parents and other caregivers need clear and accurate information in order to make proper healthy choices for their children,\" he added. \"Toddler milk and similar products should be properly labeled and marketed to assist, rather than confuse, parents and caregivers.\"\n\nAdded Sugar, Glucose Syrup and Other Ingredients\n\nFar from being the next step for infants after formula, toddler milk products contain higher saturated fat, sodium, and added sweeteners\u2014including sugar, glucose syrup solids, and honey. According to the lawsuit, Abbott's toddler milk products each contain four grams of added sugar per serving\u2014which is 22.9% added sugar for the company's \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink,\" and 20% added sugar for its \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink.\"\n\nAccording to a 2019 statement of national health and nutrition organizations published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , the proper amount of added sugar for children above twelve months of age is zero.\n\nMoreover, it is clear that parents and other caregivers are falling for the misleading marketing practices surrounding toddler milk. According to research conducted by the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at the University of Connecticut , seventy percent of those surveyed believed that products like toddler milk were suitable for toddlers, despite expert recommendations that they offer \"no unique nutritional value beyond what could be achieved through a nutritionally adequate diet; furthermore, they contribute sugars to the diet.\"\n\n\" Our research has found that common toddler milk marketing practices, including unsubstantiated nutrition-related claims and packages that look like infant formulas, mislead parents and other caregivers to believe that toddler milks provide nutritional benefits for their young children,\" said Dr. Jennifer L. Harris, Senior Research Advisor, Marketing Initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. \"This is counter to recommendations by child health experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the American Heart Association.\"\n\n\"The evidence is clear,\" she added, \"consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as toddler milks, negatively affects young children's diets and leads to related health risks.\"\n\nLead plaintiffs from Illinois, California, and Massachusetts have joined the proposed class action on behalf of all purchasers of toddler milk from Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and Washington.\n\nThe case is: Castro et al v. Abbott Laboratories (Case No. 25-cv-377, N.D. Illinois).

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be the next attorney general, listens during a meeting at the Capitol in Washington, December 2, 2024.\n\nSenate hearings for nominees of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet begin today, with more than a dozen scheduled this week. All of them are critical in their own way, with millions of lives and trillions of dollars in the balance. But I\u2019m going to focus in on Wednesday\u2019s hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee with attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, who has gotten lost amid some of the more controversial picks (including the original choice for this job, fellow Floridian Matt Gaetz).\n\nBondi perfectly represents how crime and punishment will likely be handled in the second Trump term. She has no moral qualms with basing her prosecutorial discretion on money, power, and proximity to the president. Indeed, her primary client is less likely to be the people of the United States than it is Donald Trump. In her hands, Trump can use the stick of legal action as an intimidation scheme to get corporate America to do his bidding. Considering the surfeit of cases being left in Bondi\u2019s care from the Biden administration, that\u2019s incredibly dangerous for the rule of law.\n\nMore from David Dayen\n\nAccording to a great tracker from Public Citizen, there are over 250 active investigations and cases against more than 200 corporations over various forms of misconduct. A good number of these are at the Justice Department, against such corporations as Abbott Labs, Amazon, Boeing, Block, ByteDance (owners of TikTok), private prison firm CoreCivic, CVS, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, Northrop Grumman, OceanGate (the company that launched the Titan submersible), Pfizer, Phillips 66, Polymarket, SAP, ServiceNow, SpaceX, Steward Health, Super Micro, Tenet Media, Tether, Tesla, and Toyota. That\u2019s just a partial list.\n\nIn addition, there are active investigations or cases from the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division against Apple, Google, Nvidia, Live Nation/Ticketmaster, RealPage and several landlords who used the service, UnitedHealth, Visa, and more. Since the election, there have been several dozen merger announcements, many of which will have to be adjudicated by the Justice Department as well. In short, a large chunk and maybe the majority of the economy will be shaped by the decisions of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency in the weeks and months to come. And Pam Bondi will have the final word on all of that.\n\nSimply put, she has not proven herself trustworthy to this task.\n\nAll you need to know about Bondi is that, shortly after winning office as Florida attorney general, she fired the two highest-level prosecutors investigating the biggest scandal of the century thus far: the widespread, systematic use of fake documents in courts throughout the country as a pretext to dispossess ten million families of their homes during the Great Recession. Bondi did this for a simple reason: She received tens of thousands of dollars from one of the firms caught up in this mass document fabrication scheme, a company named Lender Processing Services, and she used her office as a shield protecting that company from sanction.\n\nBondi\u2019s direct clients, or clients of the firm where she worked, have multiple interlocking legal actions before the agency that Bondi wishes to lead.\n\nThis was not a one-off incident. During her tenure as AG, Bondi was seen by corporate interests as something like their hired hand. There are numerous examples of Bondi being targeted by lobbying firms, and not only asked to drop cases against their clients, but enlisted in efforts to get other states to back off.\n\nOne lobbying firm, Dickstein Shapiro, represented LPS, for-profit college network Bridgepoint, multilevel marketer Herbalife, and health care billing firm Accretive. All were under threat from states other than Florida; the lobbyist introduced Bondi to those companies\u2019 lawyers, or simply pressured Bondi to back off, and she complied. Dickstein also represented the parent company of online travel sites Travelocity and Priceline. Florida had filed a lawsuit against that company before Bondi entered office, but after Dickstein consulted her, she suddenly dropped the case. Bondi received lavish gifts from the Republican Attorneys General Association, which Dickstein donates to, during this time. Dickstein also helped Bondi get a cover story in a corporate lawyer trade magazine, pointing to her as a rising star.\n\nBondi even declined to join a civil fraud case against Trump University, the president-elect\u2019s for-profit college scheme, after the Trump Foundation donated $25,000 to her political action committee.\n\nThis leaves the distinct impression that with Bondi, justice is up for auction.\n\nAfter leaving the AG\u2019s office, Bondi almost immediately became a registered lobbyist, and two recent reports detail her time in that position. Public Citizen reviewed disclosures and found that Bondi represented 30 different domestic and foreign clients for Ballard Partners, the same lobbying firm at which Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles worked. Bondi\u2019s clients included Amazon, which is under Justice Department investigation right now over whether it hid evidence of workplace safety violations at its warehouses. GEO Group, the private prison company that stands to gain heavily from the policies of mass deportation, was another Bondi client; DOJ has an open civil rights investigation against its top rival, CoreCivic, over lack of protections for incarcerated people.\n\nOther clients include General Motors, Uber, and Major League Baseball. As Accountable.us noted in its report, the Justice Department settled with GM in 2023 on a hiring discrimination investigation, and fined the company over trying to influence a federal investigation into an accident by its former self-driving unit Cruise. Uber settled a case with DOJ in 2022 over alleged violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act. And Major League Baseball has lobbied against DOJ\u2019s repeated attempts to strip its antitrust exemption.\n\nMeanwhile, Bondi\u2019s firm Ballard Partners also represents many clients with business before the Justice Department, including: Boeing, whose plea agreement with DOJ over its machinations in getting the deadly 737 MAX approved was rejected by a federal judge; Blackstone, whose LivCor unit is one of the named defendants in the algorithmic pricing scheme involving RealPage; and Google, which was found liable of monopolization last year in a Justice Department case and which is fighting a remedy that would partially break up the company, while also fighting a different DOJ case that targets the company\u2019s monopoly in advertising technology.\n\nIn other words, Bondi\u2019s direct clients, or clients of the firm where she worked, have multiple interlocking legal actions before the agency that Bondi wishes to lead. The recusals any normal official would undertake because of this prior history would leave Bondi sidelined for many if not most of the important decisions the Justice Department will have to make. No less than Brian Ballard, the founder of Ballard Partners, told The New York Times that Bondi couldn\u2019t be expected to recuse from all of his firm\u2019s clients, because \u201cWe represent such a broad array of American business.\u201d\n\nEx-lobbyists have run the Justice Department before. Bill Barr was Verizon\u2019s general counsel and ran an advocacy group, and yes, Eric Holder was a lobbyist. But Bondi is a step beyond, because her history includes not only lobbying but being very solicitous of lobbying, which is about the worst possible quality in an attorney general.\n\nTrump allies talk about the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Justice Department under Biden. This is a weaponization of a far different kind. It could turn the nation\u2019s top law enforcer into a corporate gatekeeper, waving through misconduct that would affect millions of workers and customers (at least for those willing to pay the right people), or training the armaments of justice on disfavored companies. Lobbyists\u2014by their own words\u2014believe they were at the controls of Bondi\u2019s office in Florida, and they have reason to believe they could stage-manage Main Justice in Washington, too. And that plays well with Trump\u2019s bullying; with the Justice Department as his willing servant, his warnings to companies carry greater weight.\n\nDespite all this, Bondi has not been slotted in the category of \u201ccontroversial\u201d nominees. Her nomination has generated slight criticism; mostly, she hasn\u2019t been noticed at all. Democrats have contented themselves with getting through the cabinet nominations and even crossing the aisle to vote for some of them. But in Bondi\u2019s hands, the Justice Department would be the main engine by which Trump\u2019s pay-to-play America will manifest. If you have enough money to hire a K Street rainmaker, you can demonstrably flout the law, and if you don\u2019t follow the regime\u2019s demands, the law will find a way to mess with you. That\u2019s what Bondi represents. The silence from Democrats over her is a form of tacit agreement with this troubling possibility.",

            "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Abbott Laboratories ( ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Abbott Laboratories's Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Abbott Laboratories had US$15.0b of debt in September 2024, down from US$15.7b, one year before. However, it also had US$7.79b in cash, and so its net debt is US$7.26b.\n\nHow Strong Is Abbott Laboratories' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Abbott Laboratories had liabilities of US$14.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$19.4b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.79b and US$7.05b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$19.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nSince publicly traded Abbott Laboratories shares are worth a very impressive total of US$194.8b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nAbbott Laboratories's net debt is only 0.67 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 31.7 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. And we also note warmly that Abbott Laboratories grew its EBIT by 11% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Abbott Laboratories's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Abbott Laboratories produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 79% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nThe good news is that Abbott Laboratories's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Abbott Laboratories commonly do use debt without problems. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Abbott Laboratories is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. We'd be very excited to see if Abbott Laboratories insiders have been snapping up shares. If you are too, then\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

            "content": "The iron heel of the financial oligarchy is coming down hard and fast on Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealth Executive Brian Thompson. Major news outlets, social media companies, and government officials all across the country have come out and declared that Mangione is guilty, despite the fact\n\nthat his trial hasn\u2019t even started. Platforms like Tiktok and Meta have acted hyper-vigilantly, scrubbing all coverage of Mangione that is not outright negative. Reddit, which loves to market itself as a bastion of free speech, has wiped Mangione\u2019s personal account off the face of its website. What was he posting that was so horrible? Health and exercise advice.\n\nThe media wants you to believe that Mangione is two things: crazy and guilty. As he was being dragged into a Pennsylvania courthouse by police, he shouted that his arrest was \u201ccompletely unjust\u201d and \u201can insult to the intelligence of the American people.\u201d It is difficult to imagine a clearer and more comprehensible statement, but the media has been breaking its back to frame this remark as evidence of Mangione\u2019s supposed mental instability.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the Commissars of Capital have already decided amongst themselves that Mangione is guilty. The trial is a mere formality, undertaken in order to keep up the appearance of a free and democratic society. There is much that points to this, but the most damning piece of evidence is that the judge handling Mangione\u2019s pre-trial hearings, Magistrate Judge Katherine H. Parker, is married to former healthcare executive Bret Parker; not only that, but she has hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock in a variety of healthcare and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAccording to independent journalist Ken Klippenstein, \u201cParker also holds scattered interests in pharmaceutical, biotech, and healthcare companies like Abbott Laboratories, the owner of St. Jude Medical. Abbot has drawn criticism over the years for manufacturing tainted and toxic baby formula, fraudulently billing Medicaid for glucose monitors, and selling faulty deep brain stimulation devices.\u201d\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a fair trial to all persons who have been charged with a crime. Do we really think that a judge like Katherine H. Parker, who has deep connections with the healthcare industry, is capable of being impartial and fair? It seems more than anything that the government wants a judge who will tow the line of the billionaire class and send Mangione to the execution chamber. If they are so worried about this case that they need a puppet judge to oversee the pre-trial hearings, what monster of a court magistrate will be overseeing his actual trial?\n\nThe entirety of the capitalist class is conspiring to execute Luigi Mangione. They are terrified of the outpouring of public support for a man who allegedly gunned down one of their own in broad daylight. They know that their rule will soon come to an end, and they know that the executioners of that rule will be the same people who have lived under their boot for decades and centuries. The capitalist class is trembling, and the people are for the first time in a long time aware of their trembling.\n\nThe rich rule by the decrees of their courts and the batons and guns of their police force. They rule at a distance and send others to do their dirty work for them. The people, when awakened to their potential for revolutionary power, have no use for such deception. Their court is the barricade; their decrees rip through the air like thunder and send the rich running for their lives. The people do not deliver justice to tyrants by banging a gavel and reading a verdict; they deliver justice to tyrants by casting them face first into the mud. The tyrants know this, and they know that their time is coming fast.",

            "content": "Ambu A/S ( ) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 27% gain and recovering from prior weakness. Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 17% is also fairly reasonable.\n\nEven after such a large jump in price, it's still not a stretch to say that Ambu's price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 6.7x right now seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" compared to the Medical Equipment industry in Denmark, where the median P/S ratio is around 6.6x. Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/S without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.\n\nWhat Does Ambu's Recent Performance Look Like?\n\nAmbu certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing revenue more than most other companies. Perhaps the market is expecting this level of performance to taper off, keeping the P/S from soaring. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Ambu's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nAmbu's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the industry.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow revenues by a handy 13% last year. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 34% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have definitely welcomed those medium-term rates of revenue growth.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% each year as estimated by the eight analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 10% each year growth forecast for the broader industry.\n\nWith this in mind, it makes sense that Ambu's P/S is closely matching its industry peers. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.\n\nWhat Does Ambu's P/S Mean For Investors?\n\nAmbu's stock has a lot of momentum behind it lately, which has brought its P/S level with the rest of the industry. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nOur look at Ambu's revenue growth estimates show that its P/S is about what we expect, as both metrics follow closely with the industry averages. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in revenue isn't great enough to push P/S in a higher or lower direction. All things considered, if the P/S and revenue estimates contain no major shocks, then it's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future.\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found that you need to take into consideration.\n\nIf strong companies turning a profit tickle your fancy, then you'll want to check out this free\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "These wildly successful companies are poised to keep your dividend portfolio healthy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThere might not be a better place to find winning stocks that can slowly make you wealthy over decades than the healthcare industry. It's an evergreen, multitrillion-dollar market that promotes growth and innovation because better healthcare saves lives.\n\nIf you want to know which healthcare companies to choose to invest in, the answer is easy: Look for those that keep raising dividends. It's not a sure thing, but it's an excellent litmus test because a company must continually innovate, grow, and manage itself well to afford to give more cash to its shareholders every year.\n\nThese three companies are healthcare leaders. They treat their shareholders well and offer promising growth prospects at attractive valuations. Consider buying them in 2025 to boost your dividend portfolio.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nYou won't explore the healthcare field for long before encountering Medtronic (MDT 2.27%). The company develops numerous products, devices, and treatment technologies for dozens of conditions. Its product portfolio ranges from cardiovascular pacemaker devices to glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes. It's a remarkably diverse and consistent business since people need care and treatment around the clock. Since the 1980s, Medtronic's sales haven't dipped more than 10% in a trailing-12-month period.\n\nThat has made it a stellar dividend stock. Medtronic isn't quite a Dividend King yet, but it soon will be. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years. You can't fake or borrow your way to decades of dividend increases. Medtronic's payout ratio is still just 65% of cash flow, so you can trust that the dividend is secure and will likely keep increasing.\n\nMedtronic isn't growing very fast, but it's positioned well for the future. The company has grown its organic revenue at a mid-single-digit rate for the past eight quarters, and analysts estimate the business will grow earnings by about 6% annually over the long term. Lastly, the stock is priced appropriately for its growth at a forward P/E ratio under 15. The stock's 3.5% dividend yield could push annualized total investment returns to 9% to 10%.\n\n2. UnitedHealth Group\n\nInsurance and healthcare services giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH -7.17%) is a key cog in America's healthcare system. It has grown into one of the world's largest corporations, generating over $389 billion in annual revenue. Its massive size enables it to offer more for less than its competitors, so it continues gobbling up patients' dollars in a system that spent $4.9 trillion in 2023 alone. The company operates two primary segments: UnitedHealthcare (insurance) and Optum (care services and technologies).\n\nThe company's seemingly endless growth has fueled 15 consecutive annual dividend increases, averaging 15% per increase for the past five years. Its 1.6% dividend yield isn't enormous but sustained double-digit growth creates significant income over time. Additionally, the dividend consumes only 56% of the company's cash flow. Since analysts estimate UnitedHealth will grow earnings by 15% annually over the long term, investors should reasonably expect more sizable dividend increases and share price gains.\n\nUnitedHealth's stock declined after the insurance segment's CEO was killed in early December, igniting controversy around health insurance in the United States. Lawmakers have since introduced potential legislation to reel back the power that companies like UnitedHealth have in the industry, though it may not pass into law. The stock's recent slide has brought UnitedHealth's valuation down to a forward P/E of 17, a bargain valuation that helps compensate for the company's political risks.\n\n3. AbbVie\n\nPharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) has remained a stalwart in healthcare due to its ability to innovate and find new growth opportunities. Although it was once part of Abbott Labs, AbbVie has thrived independently since its 2013 split. Today, AbbVie's drug portfolio includes immunology, oncology, cosmetics, neuroscience, and eye care treatments. The company has pivoted masterfully after losing patent protection for Humira, its former top-selling product, in 2023.\n\nFew stocks offer a high dividend yield and strong growth, but AbbVie does. The company is also a Dividend King if you count its years with Abbott Labs, which is another impressive feat. AbbVie's stock currently yields 3.4%, and the company has raised its dividend by an average of 8% annually over the past five years. Those increases have gotten smaller these past few years, but that could change if growth ramps back up. The stock's dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 70% of cash flow.\n\nAbbVie's stock has tumbled after its promising schizophrenia drug, the centerpiece of an $8.7 billion acquisition, failed to meet its primary endpoint in phase 2 trials. It was considered a future blockbuster for AbbVie. However, analysts still expect nearly 9% annualized earnings growth over the long term. That's enough growth to make AbbVie an easy buy at its current forward P/E ratio of less than 15.",

Start My Free Case Review\n\nIf your premature baby developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after being fed Similac formula, you may be entitled to compensation. Research has shown that premature infants who consume cow\u2019s milk-based formulas like Similac are at a significantly higher risk of developing NEC. This serious gastrointestinal condition can lead to severe health complications or even death. Our dedicated team of experienced lawyers has successfully assisted families nationwide in seeking justice and financial support for medical expenses related to NEC. You don\u2019t have to navigate this challenging time alone; we are here to help you understand your rights and options.\n\nAccording to Reuters, an Illinois jury has ordered Mead Johnson, a unit of Reckitt Benckiser, to pay $60 million to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company\u2019s Enfamil baby formula [1].\n\nThe jury in an Illinois state court in St. Clair County found Mead Johnson negligent for failing to warn of the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\n\nThe $60 million verdict includes compensation for plaintiff Jasmine Watson\u2019s loss and grief, and for the pain and suffering of her baby, Chance Dean.\n\nThis verdict marks the first trial of hundreds of lawsuits claiming that various Enfamil and Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Similac formulas caused NEC.\n\nMore than 400 NEC lawsuits against Mead Johnson and Abbott are pending in federal court in Chicago, with others, like Watson\u2019s, in state courts.\n\nPlaintiffs in these cases allege that the companies concealed the fact that their formula, including products made for premature infants, posed a higher risk than alternatives like donor milk.\n\nWhistleblower Complaint : A former employee of Abbott filed a whistleblower complaint with OSHA in February 2021, raising concerns about the Sturgis, MI facility and alleging that records related to the Similac recall were falsified. This indicates that federal authorities were aware of issues at the plant over a year before the recall occurred.\n\n: A former employee of Abbott filed a whistleblower complaint with OSHA in February 2021, raising concerns about the Sturgis, MI facility and alleging that records related to the Similac recall were falsified. This indicates that federal authorities were aware of issues at the plant over a year before the recall occurred. FDA Investigation : The FDA\u2019s investigation into the Sturgis facility revealed unsanitary conditions and numerous violations, leading to an emergency shutdown and a subsequent recall of Similac and other formulas. The facility was allowed to resume operations in early June 2022 after meeting strict conditions outlined in a consent decree with the FDA [2].\n\n: The FDA\u2019s investigation into the Sturgis facility revealed unsanitary conditions and numerous violations, leading to an emergency shutdown and a subsequent recall of Similac and other formulas. The facility was allowed to resume operations in early June 2022 after meeting strict conditions outlined in a consent decree with the FDA [2]. Impact on Formula Shortages : The recall exacerbated a shortage of baby formula in the U.S., which had begun before the issues at the Michigan plant. The situation drew significant public attention and outrage as parents struggled to find a safe formula for their infants.\n\n: The recall exacerbated a shortage of baby formula in the U.S., which had begun before the issues at the Michigan plant. The situation drew significant public attention and outrage as parents struggled to find a safe formula for their infants. Current Status: As of January 2025, Abbott\u2019s Sturgis facility has resumed operations, but ongoing legal actions related to the recall continue, with lawsuits being filed nationwide against Abbott for its handling of the contamination and recall process.\n\nSimilac Lawsuit Settlement Information\n\nThe Similac litigation is still in its early stages, and none of the baby formula lawsuits has yet been settled or gone to trial. This makes it difficult to speculate about the potential settlement value of these cases.\n\nHowever, our lawyers can predict settlement amounts by looking at verdicts in recent medical malpractice lawsuits in which the primary injury was NEC in a premature baby.\n\nThe average settlement in the 7 most recent malpractice lawsuits for NEC in infants was approximately $3.5 million. The median compensation awarded in these cases was about $1.3 million.\n\nConsidering this information, our lawyers believe the trial value is potentially much higher in the case of Similac because Abbott \u2013 a huge company making a fortune from this baby formula \u2013 is less sympathetic than doctors and nurses.\n\nSettlement awards in what will likely become a class action lawsuit are likely significantly lower than the trial value. So, with the understanding that it is still early in these Similac lawsuits and there is still a great deal of litigation to play out, our attorneys predict an average settlement value to be in the $300,000 to $800,000 range. Where a settlement would fall in that range will depend upon how badly the baby was injured.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Problem?\n\nFor a balanced diet, premature babies do best on breast or human donor milk. However, breastfeeding is not always possible in NICUs. Many low-birth-weight infants also need additional calories, so many NICU medical professionals use natural milk with a baby formula from Similac.\n\nBreast Milk vs. Formula: Risks and Benefits There are ways in which formula is similar to breast milk: they both provide energy, healthy foods, hydration, and nutrients, so your baby will grow whichever milk he is given. However, despite advances in how cow\u2019s milk-based formula is formulated and manufactured, it doesn\u2019t come close to matching the health benefits of human breast milk. Breast Milk Cow\u2019s Milk-Based Formula Contains antibodies and essential nutrients More challenging to digest for premature infants Lowers the risk of NEC and infections Associated with higher rates of NEC and sepsis The Risks of Cow\u2019s Milk-Based Formulas Premature infants often struggle to digest cow\u2019s milk-based formulas, leading to increased risks of severe gastrointestinal issues. Research highlights that: Cow\u2019s milk formulas significantly increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) .\n\n. For every 10% increase in formula consumption, the risk of sepsis rises by 18%. Symptoms Checklist for Parents Early Signs of NEC Advanced Symptoms Lethargy Lack of bowel sounds Vomiting Abdominal pain or tenderness Bloody stools Low blood pressure Abdominal bloating Fluid buildup in the abdomen Understanding Similac\u2019s Role in NICUs Similac Baby Formula, including products like Similac Human Milk Fortifier Special Care, is widely used to supplement preemie nutrition. However, these formulas may elevate the risk of NEC in premature infants, making awareness and alternative feeding strategies critical for parents and NICU staff. By organizing this information, parents and caregivers can make informed decisions, monitor early signs of NEC, and prioritize the safest nutritional practices for premature infants.\n\nFDA Warns Against Abbott Baby Formulas After Infant Dies\n\nUS health officials are warning parents not to use 3 popular powdered baby formula products manufactured at an Abbott plant in Michigan that investigators recently linked to bacterial contamination.\n\nThe FDA is investigating 4 reports of premature infants who were hospitalized after consuming the baby formula, including 1 who died. The agency said 1 of the cases involved salmonella and 3 involved Cronobacter sakazakiim, a rare but dangerous germ that can cause blood infections and other serious complications.\n\nAs this is a product used as the sole source of nutrition for many of our nation\u2019s newborns and premature infants, the FDA is deeply concerned about these reports of bacterial infections, said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response.\n\nSimilac Lawsuit Filed Over Infant\u2019s NEC Death\n\nThe recent lawsuit filed against Abbott Laboratories alleges that Similac caused a premature infant to develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) while still in the hospital, resulting in the newborn\u2019s death [3].\n\nThe complaint was filed by Shelbi Singh on behalf of herself and her deceased child, Granville Singh, in the Southern District of Indiana, on January 9, 2023, alleging that Similac formula caused the \u201ccatastrophic and preventable death of a newborn baby who died due to a horrific and deadly disease.\u201d\n\nShelbi claims Granville was born prematurely on June 13, 2017, and that less than 6 weeks later the baby died of NEC complications, which the lawsuit alleges were a direct result of the use of contaminated Similac formula given to the baby at the hospital.\n\nThe companies who manufacture these products often intentionally mislabel and misrepresent the contents of the products both to the public at-large and to the health care community, passing off these deadly products as something similar to or even superior to human breast milk, the complaint states.\n\nSingh\u2019s lawsuit brings claims of strict liability, negligence, and failure to warn and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nWhat is Similac Baby Formula?\n\nSimilac (for \u201csimilar to lactation\u201d) is a brand of infant formula products developed by Alfred Bosworth of Tufts University and marketed by Abbott Labs.\n\nThe product is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding preterm babies and premature infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water).\n\nWhich Products Use Other Cow Milk Formulas?\n\nAbout 80% of baby formulas are cow\u2019s milk-based formula, and almost every major brand (and store brand equivalent) offers a bovine-based formula, including:\n\nSimilac Special Care\n\nNeoSure\n\nHuman Milk Fortifier\n\nEnfamil\n\nEarth\u2019s Best\n\nHappy Baby\n\nGo & Grow\n\nGerber\n\nParent\u2019s Choice\n\nBaby\u2019s Only\n\nLoulouka\n\nHolle\n\nKendamil\n\nBobbie\n\nLebenswert\n\nSimilac Infant Formula Side Effects\n\nIn addition to an increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), cow\u2019s milk-based formula products have been linked to more moderate side effects, including constipation, diarrhea, and upset stomach. These effects are usually temporary and may disappear as the baby\u2019s body adjusts to the medication.\n\nIs Similac Baby Formula FDA Approved?\n\nAs stated by the USA Food And Drink Administration, the agency does not approve premature infant formulas before they can be marketed.\n\nHowever, all formulas sold in the United States must meet federal nutrient requirements and infant formula manufacturers must notify the FDA before marketing a new formula [4].\n\nWhat is Necrotizing Enterocolitis NEC?\n\nNEC is a serious gastrointestinal problem that primarily affects premature babies. The condition inflames intestinal tissue, causing it to die.\n\nA hole (perforation) may form in the intestines of babies with NEC. Bacteria can leak into the abdomen or bloodstream through the hole. NEC usually develops within 2 to 6 weeks after birth.\n\nIn some premature infants, NEC is mild. Others experience severe, life-threatening symptoms.\n\nIdentifying NEC: Warning Signs Every Parent Should Know Recognizing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) symptoms early can make a critical difference in treatment outcomes. Watch for these signs: Diarrhea and Vomiting\n\nSwollen, Red, or Tender Belly\n\nAbdominal Distension\n\nFeeding Intolerance\n\nLow Blood Pressure (Hypotension)\n\nSlow Heart Rate (Bradycardia)\n\nTemperature Instability\n\nApnea (Pauses in Breathing)\n\nLethargy Timeline of NEC Development Stages Stage Description Timeframe Post-Birth Stage 1 Suspected NEC with early symptoms 2-3 weeks Stage 2 Confirmed NEC with more severe symptoms 3-4 weeks Stage 3 Advanced NEC requiring surgical intervention 4+ weeks Immediate Action: What to Do if You Notice NEC Symptoms Understanding what steps to take if your baby exhibits symptoms of NEC can help ensure timely care: If your baby shows multiple symptoms like abdominal swelling or feeding intolerance, contact your healthcare provider immediately . Early detection is critical.\n\nlike abdominal swelling or feeding intolerance, . Early detection is critical. If severe symptoms appear , such as persistent vomiting or a red, swollen abdomen, seek emergency medical attention immediately.\n\n, such as persistent vomiting or a red, swollen abdomen, immediately. If NEC symptoms persist despite treatment, discuss your concerns with your baby\u2019s medical team to explore adjustments to the care plan. NEC Treatment Options: Steps to Recovery Managing NEC requires a tailored approach based on the severity of the condition. Here\u2019s a simplified guide to the treatment process: Initial Management Discontinue feedings immediately to rest the digestive system.\n\nInsert a nasogastric tube to relieve stomach pressure.\n\nAdminister intravenous fluids and start antibiotics to combat infection. Close Monitoring Regular abdominal X-rays should be conducted to track the progression of the disease.\n\nPerform blood tests to detect infections and monitor overall health. Surgical Intervention In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove damaged portions of the intestine.\n\nIf a significant part of the intestine is affected, a bowel transplant may be necessary to ensure long-term recovery. Parents can play an active role in their baby\u2019s recovery by staying informed about NEC symptoms, knowing when to act, and understanding the treatment options.\n\nSimilac Lawsuits: Infant Deaths and Allegations of Deceptive Marketing The link between Similac baby formula and severe health complications, including infant deaths and misleading marketing claims, has sparked a series of lawsuits against Abbott Laboratories. Below is an overview of the significant cases and allegations surrounding Similac products.\n\nAbbott Baby Formula Linked to 2nd Infant Death\n\nThe CDC announced on Feb. 28, 2022, that Abbott Laboratories Similac Human Milk Fortifier PM 60/40 baby formula product has been linked to a second infant death.\n\nThe baby formula was produced at Abbott Laboratories Sturgis, Michigan facility, where four cases of Cronobacter sakazakii and one case of Salmonella are linked to as of the announcement. The CDC said the Cronobacter infections may have contributed to the two infant deaths.\n\nThe particular lot of baby formula named in the expanded Similac recall was distributed nationwide and to Israel, with those cases coming from Minnesota, Texas, and Ohio. These and more result in various baby formula NEC lawsuits.\n\nLawsuit Filed After Newborn Died From NEC\n\nThe parents of a child who died of NEC have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the makers of Similac, alleging the infant formula caused the severe intestinal disease.\n\nThe complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on May 14, 2021, by Alicia Restad and Daniel Renteria-Hernandez, alleging Abbott Labs and Mead Johnson & Company, LLC are responsible for the death of their child, Daniel Renteria-Hernandez.\n\nAccording to the Similac lawsuit, baby Daniel was born on April 29, 2019, at Dignity Hospital in Merced, California. He\u2019s one of the low birth weight infants that only weigh two pounds and two ounces after only 31 weeks of pregnancy and was put in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Valley Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nAt only 16 days, Daniel died from NEC, which the parents blame Similac fed to him during his short life, according to the Similac lawsuit against Mead Johnson.\n\nLawsuit Claims Abbott Laboratories Deceptively Marketed Similac\n\nThe proposed class action lawsuit against Abbott Laboratories has brought attention to claims of deceptive marketing and minimal nutritional benefits in the Similac Go & Grow toddler drinks. Below is a detailed breakdown of the allegations and evidence presented in the lawsuit. Claims of Defective Manufacturing and Marketing Tactics Abbott Laboratories is accused of manufacturing Similac Go & Grow toddler drinks in a way that offers minimal nutritional value while maximizing company profits. The lawsuit alleges that the product is misleadingly advertised as a vital next step for toddlers\u2019 development despite being nearly identical to standard cow\u2019s milk formula. Shift in Feeding Trends and Impact on Sales The lawsuit highlights a significant shift in feeding practices among mothers, with breastfeeding rates increasing since 2003, as reported by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This trend led to a decline in infant formula sales, prompting Abbott to rebrand and market new products as \u201ctransition formulas\u201d under the Similac Go & Grow line. Other products in this category include labels such as: Follow-On Formulas\n\nWeaning Formulas\n\nToddler Milk\n\nGrowing-Up Milk Evidence of Misleading Branding The lawsuit cites U.S. Nielsen data from 2003 to 2015, which shows a fourfold increase in advertising for transition formulas. Giovanna Smith, the plaintiff, claims the labels on Similac Go & Grow toddler drinks mirror those of Similac infant formulas, with parallel designs and no clear distinction between the two. False Impression of Necessity Smith alleges that Abbott\u2019s marketing falsely implies that Similac Go & Grow is essential for toddlers\u2019 growth and development. The lawsuit references research from the University of Connecticut\u2019s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, which indicates public misconceptions about toddler formula products. Broader Implications This lawsuit questions the nutritional value of Similac Go & Grow and highlights concerns about how formula manufacturers adapt to market trends at the expense of consumer trust. It underscores the importance of transparency in marketing nutritional products for children. The case against Abbott Laboratories is ongoing, as the plaintiff seeks to hold the company accountable for its allegedly deceptive practices.\n\nWhat are Baby Formula NEC Lawsuits Alleging?\n\nIf your baby received Similac in a hospital or NICU, or if your child developed NEC after taking Similac, you can file Similac baby formula lawsuits against the manufacturers of Similac with the help of our attorney.\n\nThese Similac Recall Lawsuits allege that Abbott knew about the risk of developing NEC but failed to warn of this risk.\n\nIf your child suffered harm from NEC after being fed Similac, he or she may require a lifetime of care and professional medical advice to deal with complications of the disease.\n\nTragically, you may even have experienced death from this condition. When this occurs, you need someone who can fight for justice and help file baby formula lawsuits.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I join a class action lawsuit if my child was affected by Similac?\n\nYes, parents of children affected by Similac may join a class action lawsuit if one is available.

Yet, tucked within its cutting-edge cyber security center lies a hub of global intelligence activity: the Center for Intelligence, Research, Analysis, and Training (CIRAT).\n\nLed by Brian Fuller, CIRAT brings together faculty experts and students from diverse fields, including Intelligence Studies, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. Their mission? To collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence for clients ranging from the U.S. Department of Defense to Fortune 500 companies.\n\nOne high-profile project involves CIRAT analysts using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to track foreign nations' space programs for the Department of Defense\u2019s National Space Intelligence Center. Another partnership with Abbott Laboratories has analysts investigating the fraudulent use of the Abbott brand worldwide. Locally, CIRAT provides risk and threat analysis to enhance security at Erie International Airport.\n\nAmid this nucleus of intensive intelligence exploration is sophisticated technology that takes CIRAT\u2019s capabilities to a whole new level. Case in point is the AirNav Radarbox, a premium-level system that offers worldwide tracking of commercial, military, and general aviation flights.\n\nImage\n\nOn any given day, approximately 9,700 planes are traversing the skies worldwide. Fuller said student analysts regularly monitor the air traffic via a super-sized computer screen peppered with images of miniature planes. Their goal is to notify clients of abnormalities that could potentially affect their operations.\n\n\u201cIf we start to see anomalies\u2014let\u2019s say China reduces or eliminates domestic flights over Taiwan airspace\u2014that allows us to consider that China may be intending some kind of military action in the region and notify our clients of the possibility,\u201d Fuller explained.\n\nBesides leveraging capabilities via air and marine radar systems, the CIRAT team also monitors and analyzes geospatial intelligence platforms and Generative AI solutions.\n\nIn 2024, CIRAT enhanced its capabilities by partnering with California-based Vizru to integrate Rover, an advanced Generative AI platform that analyzes public data and datasets within firewalls to unlock insights securely.\n\n\u201cThis technology allows CIRAT to stay on the leading edge of providing timely, relevant, and accurate intelligence to its private sector, government, and nonprofit clients, while allowing students to become trained in the operational processes of Generative AI,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nCurrently, approximately 130 students are engaged in CIRAT projects. \u201cOur students are performing tasks that typically come after years of experience in the field,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cThey\u2019re contributing to critical national security efforts and global industries like Dell Technologies and Pfizer. The impact of their work is significant, often bearing global implications.\u201d\n\nMercyhurst University\u2019s CIRAT stands as a testament to the power of blending academic rigor with real-world application, preparing students to become leaders in the intelligence community.\n\nPHOTO: (L-R) Erie Insurance consultant Sidd Mahur, student Jay Dalmaso, and Brian Fuller",

The company had two major segments: pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In 2012, the company decided to spin-off its innovative pharmaceutical business out of which AbbVie Inc. was established. The generic drugs business, however, remained with Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie\u2019s new headquarter is located in neighboring Lake Bluff, Illinois. During 2020, AbbVie completed its largest M&A deal so far by acquiring Ireland-based Allergan for 63 billion U.S. dollars. This is one of the biggest M&A deals of the biopharmaceutical history ever Among AbbVie\u2019s various products, Humira (adalimumab) has an outstanding position. Humira is used for the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease . Over the last four years, the product generated annual revenues of about 20 billion U.S. dollars. Before the appearance of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty , Humira was the global top drug based on revenue. In some years, the blockbuster made up around two thirds of the company\u2019s total revenues. Given the threat through patent expiration and generic/biosimilar competition, such a dependence on one product could potentially have negative effects for a pharmaceutical company. Biosimilars of Humira have already been available in several countries since 2014. In AbbVie\u2019s major market, the U.S., Humira started facing biosimilar competition only from 2023, but already combined with heavy revenue losses. AbbVie was quite \u2018famous\u2019, and often criticized, due to its aggressive patent strategy and pricing policy for Humira in the United States: dozens of patents were filed for the drug, but for various medical conditions, while between 2016 and 2021 alone Humira's net price increased by 60 percent.",

            "content": "With bellwether trials just a few months away, 2025 is set to be a key year for the hundreds of ongoing baby formula lawsuits.\n\nPlaintiffs have claimed that popular formula manufacturers failed to warn of the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in some infants. They\u2019ve seen a pair of huge trial wins in 2024 that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\n\nBut the defendant\u2019s surprising trial victory in October has cast some doubt on how the litigation may play out. This win suggests the path to a major settlement for plaintiffs is not guaranteed.\n\nThe coming months will be critical to determining the eventual resolution of these lawsuits as the first bellwether trials near.\n\nPromising Year for Baby Formula Plaintiffs Ends with Unexpected Loss\n\nLate into 2024, plaintiffs appeared to have a firm upper hand in the baby formula litigation after securing big wins in two state trials.\n\nIn March, a jury in Illinois awarded $60 million to the mother of a baby who died from NEC after being fed one of Mead Johnson\u2019s Enfamil formulas.\n\nIn July, a few months later, the family of a baby that developed NEC and suffered irreversible neurological damage after being fed Abbott\u2019s Similac was awarded a staggering $495 million by a Missouri jury.\n\nSee if You Qualify for a Lawsuit Our Partners Our Trusted Legal Partners Drugwatch partners with trusted law firms to help you take legal action. After submitting the form, one of Drugwatch's partners will contact you for a free case review.\n\nWith major verdicts secured against both manufacturers of the formulas in question, there appeared to be a clear roadmap for plaintiffs to continue seeing success. This suggests that a settlement could eventually be agreed upon.\n\nBut an October trial that named both Mead Johnson and Abbott as defendants ended with a starkly different result. The Missouri jury sided with the defendants for the first time, determining that neither company was liable for the development of NEC in a baby that was left with lifelong health issues.\n\n\u201cThis outcome illustrates that moving forward, plaintiffs face significant challenges due to the heavy burden they must meet in proving elements of their claims in every single case,\u201d Mead Johnson said in a statement following the verdict.\n\nBaby Formula Bellwether Trials Set to Play Major Role\n\nThe next step in the baby formula litigation is a big one: the start of bellwether trials as part of federal multidistrict litigation (MDL).\n\nDue to their similarities, hundreds of the pending baby formula cases have been grouped together in an Illinois-based MDL under one judge. The upcoming bellwether trials will serve as test cases. These cases will help both sides understand what outcomes would be likely if more cases went to trial.\n\nThe first of the bellwether trials is set to start on May 5. Two more after that scheduled for August and November. The first case will be Ericka Mar, as Administratrix of the Estate of RaiLee Mar v. Abbott Laboratories.\n\nAccording to court documents, Ericka\u2019s baby RaiLee was born prematurely on Jan. 1, 2014, and was quickly sent to the NICU. There, she was fed her mother\u2019s breast milk for nearly two weeks.\n\nRaiLee was then fed a Similac formula for the first time on Jan. 14. By the next day, she had developed a distended abdomen and bloody stool and was started on triple antibiotics. Parts of her intestines then had to be removed due to necrosis later that day.\n\nShe died from NEC the next day in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cAt the time of her death, Baby RaiLee\u2019s parents were unaware of the fact that the Defendant\u2019s Cow\u2019s Milk-Based Product she was fed caused or substantially contributed to her development of NEC and ultimately to her death,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nThe next two bellwether trials also name Abbott as the defendant, with the first bellwether against Mead Johnson scheduled for February 2026.\n\nAs of this month, over 600 baby formula lawsuits are pending in multidistrict litigation.\n\nEditor Lindsay Donaldson contributed to this article.",

            "content": "OPKO Health, Inc. OPK is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its potential in RAYALDEE. The optimism surrounding the stock is backed by RAYALDEE\u2019s performance and strategic partnerships. However, stiff competition and overdependence on RAYALDEE are concerns.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 48.1% in the past year compared with the industry's 6.5% growth. The S&P 500 has gained 25.5% in the said time frame.\n\nThis renowned multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company has a market capitalization of $1.03 billion. The company predicts 8% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. In the trailing four quarters, OPKO Health surpassed earnings estimates thrice and missed on one occasion, the average beat being 46.39%.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors Favoring OPK Stock\n\nPotential of RAYALDEE: Within the pharmaceutical business, Rayaldee has been OPKO Health\u2019s leading renal product in the U.S. market for the last two years. Rayaldee is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of SHPT in adults with stage three or four chronic kidney disease and vitamin D insufficiency. Rayaldee has been witnessing decent momentum, courtesy of successful efforts from the sales team.\n\n\n\nThe drug is distributed in the United States principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the United States (collectively known as Rayaldee Customers). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, OPKO Health has entered into arrangements with many healthcare providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee.\n\nAccelerated Clinical Trials Buoys Optimism: OPKO Health has undertaken various trials and has been part of many with respect to its products. On theearnings callof third-quarter 2024, OPKO Health\u2019s management confirmed that the enrollment and dosing are currently underway in the MDX2001 Phase 1 trial for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. MDX2001, a tetraspecific antibody, is designed to optimize Tcell function while preventing tumor antigen escape. The Phase 1a portion is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ascending doses of MDX2001 in patients with various solid tumors.\n\n\n\nOn the same call, management continued that in the last few years, several European countries have initiated population-based prostate cancer screening trials to evaluate whether a screening algorithm that included both PSA and biomarker tests can reduce over-diagnosis of prostate cancer. OPKO Health\u2019s 4Kscore test has been included in several of these mass screening trials and demonstrated the value of the 4Kscore test in stratifying men with elevated PSA and a high probability of prostate cancer.\n\n\n\nOPKO Health\u2019s other immunobiology programs, MDX-2003, a tetraspecific antibody for liquid tumors and autoimmune indications, as well as MDX-2004, an immune modulator, multi-specific antibody, are progressing to INDs and are expected to enter the clinic next year.\n\nStrong Q3 Results: OPKO Health exited the third quarter of 2024 with better-than-expected earnings and encouraging revenues from the transfer of intellectual property and others. Management\u2019s confirmation that enrollment and dosing are currently underway in the MDX2001 Phase 1 trial for the treatment of solid tumor cancers and the announcement of promising results of an orally delivered oxyntomodulin analog raise our optimism about the company. OPK has also been awarded $51 million of additional funding under an existing BARDA contract to develop COVID multispecific antibodies and to initiate an influenza program is also encouraging.\n\nFactors That May Offset the Gains for OPK\n\nOverdependence on RAYALDEE: OPKO Health's financial success depends heavily on the commercialization of Rayaldee, its only approved pharmaceutical product in the United States. Failure to effectively market Rayaldee could severely impact the company's revenues, profitability and overall business operations. Additionally, Rayaldee's market reputation, safety and perceived efficacy are crucial. Any negative publicity, safety concerns or rumors about the product could significantly harm OPKO's business, undermining the product's acceptance and damaging its financial outlook.\n\nStiff Competition: OPKO Health faces significant competition in both its pharmaceutical and diagnostics businesses. Major pharmaceutical, diagnostic companies and research institutions have much larger financial and operational resources, enabling them to invest heavily in R&D and marketing, often more than a broader revenue base. Competitors like Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America dominate the diagnostics sector, making it challenging for OPKO to compete. This disparity in resources and research may limit OPKO's ability to innovate and scale as effectively as its larger rivals, potentially hindering the company\u2019s growth and market share.\n\nEstimate Trend of OPK\n\nOPKO Health is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2024. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss has narrowed from 26 cents to 23 cents per share.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 revenues and loss per share is pegged at $155.1 million and 9 cents, respectively. The revenue estimate indicates 14.7% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Masimo MASI, Accuray ARAY and Abbott Laboratories ABT.\n\nMasimo, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 11.8% for 2025.

            "content": "NEWARK, Del, Jan. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global Coronary Stents Market, valued at USD 35.5 billion in 2025, is expected to grow at a robust CAGR of 5.6%, reaching an impressive valuation of USD 57.9 billion by 2035. This growth is fuelled by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements in stent manufacturing, and rising demand for minimally invasive procedures.\n\nAs per the latest Future Market Insights (FMI) analysis, demand for coronary stents and portable coronary stents will rise exponentially in the coming years. An aging population and a rising prevalence of risk factors such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), complex lesions, diabetes, obesity, and others are expected to drive demand for coronary stents over the forecast period.\n\nAdded advantages of stenting procedures include substantial improvement of blood flow and prevention of further damage to the heart muscle. It also helps in improving the symptoms of heart disease, such as angina and shortness of breath thereby, reducing the need for coronary bypass surgery. Thus, surgeons prefer stenting, as it is a minimally invasive procedure and post-operative recovery is relatively fast.\n\nCoronary stents, small mesh tubes used to restore blood flow in blocked arteries, are playing a critical role in combating coronary artery diseases globally. As healthcare providers increasingly adopt advanced stenting solutions, the market is witnessing steady expansion in both developed and emerging economies.\n\nThe growing geriatric population is a major driver of market growth, as aging is a significant risk factor for heart diseases. Additionally, enhanced reimbursement policies in various countries and government initiatives aimed at reducing cardiovascular mortality rates are supporting the adoption of coronary stents.\n\nBy 2035, the market is expected to see a significant shift toward bioresorbable stents, driven by patient preference for temporary implants over permanent solutions. This shift underscores the industry\u2019s move toward innovation and patient-centric care.\n\nWhich Drivers Underpin Coronary Stents Industry Expansion?\n\nIncreasing Prevalence of Obesity Likely to Augment the Overall Demand\n\nThe increasing global aging population is resulting in an increasing patient pool with major cardiovascular diseases. Also, hypertension is emerging as a major public health concern. Aged individuals are more prone to various cardiovascular diseases due to high total serum cholesterol levels.\n\nAlso, obesity is one of the major risk factors responsible for various cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Excessive weight or obesity causes abnormal or excessive accumulation of fats inside the artery lumen that causes several health problems such as coronary heart diseases. Hence, weight loss and obesity management are integral parameters to avoid any kind of cardiovascular disease.\n\nAccording to WHO estimates, each year, 2.8 million deaths across the globe are due to diseases caused by obesity. Thus, the increasing aging and obese population are major factors expected to fuel the growth of the global coronary stents market over the forecast period.\n\nIncreasing the Number of Stenting Procedures to Push the Sales\n\nAdded advantages of stenting procedures include substantial improvement of blood flow and prevention of further damage to the heart muscle. Patients suffering from coronary artery blockage are prescribed coronary stenting. Angioplasty is the first line of treatment for patients suffering from acute coronary artery blockages.

Her first election campaign was in 1987, working with Peter Mandelson and Philip Gould to create Labour\u2019s Shadow Communications Agency for Neil Kinnock. She advised Tony Blair prior to 1997 and went on to become chief pollster to Rt Hon Gordon Brown, first as Chancellor of the Exchequer, then as Prime Minister.\n\nThrough this period, Deborah was one of Britain\u2019s leading commentators on public opinion, frequently speaking, writing and broadcasting about the mood of the nation. Her first book, Talking to a Brick Wall, which chronicled the New Labour years through the eyes of the voter, was published in 2010. Her second book, Beyond the Red Wall, used ethnography, qualitative and quantitative research to understand changing voting patterns in the 2019 General Election.\n\nDeborah has also set up and run several successful businesses. In 1992, she co-founded Opinion Leader Research, a specialist strategy consultancy which she later sold to the Chime Communications Group. She then founded the Smart Company, \u2013 a CSR strategy business which was also acquired by Chime and later merged with the Corporate Citizenship Company.\n\nIn 2010 Deborah left Chime to co found BritainThinks, now Thinks Insight and Strategy, where she worked with a wide range of clients including Abbott Laboratories, McDonald\u2019s, the CityUK and Apetito.\n\nDeborah has used her political and business experience as trustee for a number of charities including dance festival, Dance Umbrella, as well as thecampaigning organization Green Alliance. She served two terms as Chair of Young Women\u2019s Trust (formerly YWCA), overseeing a major change management programme including recruitment of a new board and senior management team, streamlining and redesigning key services, relaunching the new brand and returning finances to the black after many years of deficit. Deborah is also passionate about the theatre; she was on the board and development board of the Theatre Royal at Stratford East until 2021 and is currently serving on an advisory board to the National Theatre.\n\nSince stepping down from her role with Keir Starmer\u2019s team after the election, Deborah provided consultancy to the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, Progressive Policy Institute, advising the Democrats ahead of the U.S. election and subsequently sharing the \u2018lessons learned\u2019 with sister parties in other countries. The Prime Minister nominated her to be a life peer last Autumn, and she will be introduced to the House of Lords in February.",

            "content": "Tempus AI, Inc. TEM recently announced a collaboration with Genialis, the RNA-biomarker company. The multi-year agreement allows Genialis to leverage Tempus\u2019 multimodal dataset to develop new RNA-based algorithms across cancer types.\n\nThe collaboration between Tempus and Genialis is likely to prove beneficial by combining the former\u2019s expertise in clinical and molecular data with the latter\u2019s AI-driven analytics. Together, they aim to develop advanced RNA-based biomarker algorithms, which can improve the accuracy of diagnostics and the effectiveness of personalized treatments in precision medicine.\n\n(Read more: Tempus AI Stock Surges 23% in 6 Months: Should You Snap It Up Now?)\n\nLikely Trend of TEM Stock Following the News\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares of the company moved south 3.5% and closed at $37.49 yesterday. In the past year, TEM\u2019s shares have lost 6.9% compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 10.5%. The S&P 500 has gained 25.4% in the same time frame.\n\nHowever, the collaboration between Tempus and Genialis enhances its offerings in precision medicine, particularly through AI-driven RNA biomarker development. This could attract more partnerships, improve its diagnostic and treatment platforms, and increase revenue potential. As these innovations gain traction in healthcare, Tempus' market position could strengthen, leading to long-term growth. Investors recognizing these advancements may drive higher stock value over time.\n\nMeanwhile, TEM currently has a market capitalization of $6.12 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $698.5 million, indicating 117.8% growth from the reported figure of fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore on TEM\u2019s Collaboration With Genialis\n\nClinical care for cancer patients is often limited by the lack of accurate biomarkers that predict how well a patient will respond to treatment. To solve this problem, Genialis has developed an AI-powered model, using data from around 1 million RNA-sequencing samples from diverse patients worldwide. This large molecular model, known as the Genialis TM Supermodel, generates precise and detailed biomarker algorithms that can help biopharma companies improve drug development.\n\nAs part of a collaboration with Tempus, Genialis is now using its analytics platform, Lens, to access de-identified patient data and validate these biomarkers. This partnership will help speed up the development of Genialis\u2019 clinical algorithms, bringing them closer to being used in healthcare. In exchange, Tempus will have the opportunity to evaluate and potentially license these algorithms for use in its xR platform, expanding the company\u2019s capabilities in clinical drug development.\n\nTempus' multimodal dataset has played a key role in the development of Genialis krasID, the first commercially available algorithm that identifies which cancer patients will benefit from KRAS inhibition. This algorithm, introduced at the 6th Annual Targeting-RAS Drug Development Summit in September 2024, predicts how patients will respond to KRAS-targeted treatments across different types of cancer and mutations. Genialis krasID has been independently validated using Tempus' real-world data and is able to categorize patients into high or low-likelihood groups for treatment response, with these groups already being tested in real-world studies.\n\nFavorable Industry Prospects for TEM\n\nPer a report by Grand View Research, the global AI in healthcare market size was estimated at $19.27 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 38.5% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nThe growing adoption of digital technologies in the healthcare sector owing to the growing need for reducing healthcare costs and offering enhanced quality patient-care services to patients are the prominent factors that are boosting the growth of global artificial intelligence in the healthcare market.\n\nTEM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nTEM carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Masimo MASI, Accuray ARAY and Abbott Laboratories ABT.\n\nMasimo, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated growth rate of 11.8% for 2025.

            "content": "Abbott Laboratories ABT shares are trading at a discount to the Zacks Medical Products industry. Its trailing 12-month price-to-book value of 4.91X is significantly lower than the industry average of 7.64X and the benchmark\u2019s average of 8.77.\n\nThe stock also remains attractively valued compared to its peers like Boston Scientific BSX with a P/B of 6.47X and Stryker SYK with a P/B of 6.72.\n\nA low P/B compared to the industry average and competitors can present a buying opportunity for value investors on the assumption that the market is yet to fully recognize the company\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nABT, a MedTech behemoth with a market capitalization of $196 billion, continues to face industrywide challenges of margin pressure stemming from growing inflation, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. However, the company\u2019s ability to pivot and deliver solid results in key areas underscores its resilience and strategic acumen. The company is poised to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results (scheduled on Jan. 22, 2025) on a strong and optimistic trajectory, backed largely by strategic investments and operational efficiency.\n\nIn the past six months, the industrywide issues stated above were reflected in the performance of the broader industry, which improved a mere 9.1%, and the Medical sector, which declined 9.3%. The S&P 500 index improved 7.4% during this period. Encouragingly, Abbott outperformed all three, registering a six-month share improvement of 11.6%.\n\nDuring this period, Stryker stock rose 5.8%, while shares of Boston Scientific rallied 20.2%.\n\n6-Month Price Comparison\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEncouraging 2025 Prospects for Abbott\n\nIn Diagnostics, on a global scale, Abbott has been gaining a prominent position in point-of-care testing, with a portfolio focused on four key areas such as Infectious Disease, Cardiometabolic & Informatics, Toxicology and Consumer Diagnostics. In rapid and point-of-care diagnostics businesses, the company is consistently expanding its test menus and is also capitalizing on the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional healthcare settings.\n\nMeanwhile, within Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), the company is strategically progressing with its advancement in biosimilars. Abbott, leveraging on its leading presence in emerging markets, is enjoying a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital-efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to the emerging market population. In this line, the company agreed to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women\u2019s health in 2023. The first round of commercialization is on track for 2025. Recently, the company completed additional agreements to get access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP1 medications. The company is highly optimistic about this initiative, considering the fact that biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market.\n\nWithin Diabetes Care, the company is fast gaining momentum, leveraging consistent upgrades of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, FreeStyle Libre. In the third quarter of 2024, in Diabetes Care, sales of CGM exceeded $1.6 billion and grew 21%. In August, the company announced that it had entered into a unique global partnership with Medtronic to connect Abbott's FreeStyle Libre CGM sensor with Medtronic\u2019s automated insulin delivery systems. Earlier in 2024, Abbott announced that Tandem Diabetes Care\u2019s t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology is the first automated insulin delivery (AID) system to integrate with the newly available FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor, Abbott\u2019s latest CGM technology. Abbott is currently working with other leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with Libre 2 and Libre 3.\n\nAbbott Settles Disputes With Dexcom\n\nInvestors seem upbeat about ABT\u2019s recent agreement to settle all pending lawsuits with the company\u2019s CGM peer Dexcom DXCM. The agreement will lead to the dismissal of all pending cases worldwide. It also includes a provision that the parties will not litigate patent, trade dress and design rights disputes with each other for the next 10 years.\n\nAs litigation expenses weigh hugely on the company\u2019s operating profits, the latest development came as a sigh of relief for the investors. Abbott management considers this agreement a positive development, as it allows the company to fully focus on the advancement of the Diabetes Care business.\n\nHigh Return on Equity for ABT Stock\n\nABT\u2019s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 20.18% significantly outpaces the average earned by companies in the Medical Products industry (16.62%). This superior ROE underscores Abbott\u2019s efficient management and ability to generate strong returns for shareholders, further reinforcing its investment appeal.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhy Abbott Stock is a Buy\n\nAbbott\u2019s diversified business model has been a significant factor in its consistent performance. It has also helped the company to mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations in any single segment. The company\u2019s strong market position, promising growth prospects and consistent share gains make it a compelling buy.\n\nApart from its discounted valuation compared to the industry average, Abbott\u2019s strong ROE also indicates that the company is good at turning equity capital into net income, suggesting strong operational efficiency. Even amid the challenging scenario in terms of profit margins, this shows that the business is still generating significant earnings relative to the equity invested by shareholders.\n\nFurther, Abbott\u2019s financial strength, evident from its strong cash flow and conservative leverage profile, enhances its ability to invest in growth opportunities. The stock\u2019s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) underscores its upward potential.

            "content": "In this episode of Eureka!, a McKinsey podcast on innovation in life sciences R&D, cohosts Navraj Nagra, Alex Devereson, and Erika Stanzl speak with Howard Jacob, vice president of genomics research and head of data integration at AbbVie. They discuss AbbVie\u2019s early leap into data integration, what\u2019s wrong with medical silos, the vast potential of AI and machine learning (ML), and building capabilities. They also consider the potential of genomic sequencing to identify disease cohorts and a future in which cures trump treatment across the healthcare system.\n\nAn edited version of their conversation follows.\n\nHow AI and ML can advance genomic research\n\nNavraj Nagra: How have the twists and turns of your life and career led you to AbbVie?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019ve been interested in science since age five. I wanted to be a marine biologist until my junior year in college. Then I worked as a summer technician at Abbott Laboratories and decided drug discovery would be of interest. I got my PhD in pharmacology, did postdocs in genomics, and spent 30 years in faculty, and now I'm working at AbbVie, a spinout of Abbott. So it\u2019s a full circle. I started here, got interested in pharmacology, and now I\u2019m back.\n\nErika Stanzl: For context, can you tell us about AbbVie and the areas you focus on?\n\nHoward Jacob: I was hired to lead the AbbVie Genomics Research Center, a global organization that covers data generation for omics ; all the computational teams; functional genomics; CRISPR screening; human genetics; and pharmacogenomics. Our large group of about 140 people helps the organization from early discovery through corporate strategy, biologics manufacturing, and postmarket analysis. My other job is leading R&D data integration across all 12,600 people that do research at AbbVie. Our advantage is having all this wonderful, centralized data we need to do AI and ML.\n\nErika Stanzl: How is AbbVie using AI and ML, and what successes have you had to date?\n\nHoward Jacob: It took Philip Hajduk [vice president of R&D information research at AbbVie] and his team several years to build a platform; integrate all our data, including clinical trial data; put policies in place; and get people on board. We have about two billion edges in our knowledge graph. I felt that because AI and ML had been promised for 30 years, we had some time, but wow! It has just taken off in the past year or even six months.\n\nInside AbbVie, we have begun to look at everything within the past year\u2014early target discovery, target development, biologics design, and patient recruitment and engagement. The uptake is just extraordinary, and I\u2019m glad we put the infrastructure in place so we could start running fast. We\u2019ve gone from thinking about this to sprinting, so it\u2019s been a heck of a year.\n\nUsing data to find better healthcare solutions\n\nAlex Devereson: On that note, which therapeutic areas, specifically within your expertise\u2014genomics, research, and precision medicine\u2014are you most excited about?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019m most excited about looking at all the data to start really thinking about cures. We put a cures program in place a few years ago, but pulling the information together has been a challenge. Now, we have all the data, including external data, in one place, and we can use AI and ML to ask questions and identify patterns. For example, we\u2019ve been looking at the molecular fingerprints of disease, and we\u2019ve found hundreds of genes, but that isn\u2019t practical for making a diagnostic. With AI and ML, we can distill it down to a smaller number of key genes that we can use to create a diagnostic. That\u2019s a huge change.\n\nMedicine today is based on disciplines such as rheumatology, dermatology, and oncology, but the body doesn\u2019t know about those fields; it\u2019s just trying to maintain homeostasis. Now, with all this data and the ability to analyze it, we\u2019re going to find indication expansion and better definitions of disease. We\u2019re going to realize these fields overlap and the way we practice medicine is ultrarigid. We\u2019re not going to have to do it that way anymore.\n\nWe sometimes compare AI and ML outputs with perfection instead of comparing them with what we would have delivered in the absence of technology. We\u2019re in a phase of tremendous skepticism, and everybody is pointing out where AI and ML don\u2019t work instead of saying we need to keep improving them. Building trust is the key. We have to elevate the conversation to focus on what they do well and how we can leverage them to continue to get better. I saw the same thing when genomics was first coming out. People felt it was a waste of money. We don\u2019t have those conversations anymore. The difference here is the ultrafast speed at which AI and ML are getting adopted.\n\nNavraj Nagra: How do you think about building data capabilities internally and partnering with the business to ensure there is uptake of those capabilities?\n\nHoward Jacob: Building capabilities is an interesting challenge. In a recent presentation to a subset of the board, I said AbbVie is a science-driven company using data to make drugs, but in the future, we\u2019ll be a data-driven company using science to make drugs. We\u2019re going to need new talent, infrastructure, and data navigation capabilities. We\u2019re also going to need to put policies in place to use the data and get more comfortable making investments in places we hadn\u2019t thought about before.\n\nWe need people who can take massive amounts of data and turn it into something scientists can use. We need computational power. Any given pharma company probably doesn\u2019t have enough data on its own, so how do we aggregate data and add healthcare data? Everyone also needs to have the right guardrails in place to ensure data protection and responsible AI use while also keeping up with an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nA mission to deliver more holistic care to patients\n\nErika Stanzl: Do you have any other passion projects at AbbVie that would be fun for listeners to hear about and that speaks to your soul?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019m excited about partnering with our patients for discovery through the AbbVie Research Collaborative. We want to learn from them and give them a voice. We think we can create a safe environment and give people information about diseases from a credible, trusted source. We\u2019re all living experiments. If we come back to the fact that medicine is divided into fields, all of us have multiple things happening in our lives physiologically. Nobody has only one disease, yet we treat diseases in isolation. What if we started looking at it from a holistic perspective? So that\u2019s my passion.\n\nNavraj Nagra: At a time when there is this mass democratization, particularly of genomic data, how are you and AbbVie thinking about using it to diagnose and deliver care to patients?\n\nHoward Jacob: We\u2019ve retrospectively gone back into our clinical trials and sequenced genomes, and we found information that would have been great to know ahead of time. Now we\u2019re going back in and using this information for biomarkers and so forth. We\u2019re also starting to get patient data sets from genome sequencing and transcriptomics so we can design better clinical trials.\n\nNavraj Nagra: Most healthcare today is organized at the population level. As more people start to understand their personalized risk scores, it could completely change the way medicine is practiced. But is the healthcare system, which is already under massive strain, ready to adopt that level of change?\n\nHoward Jacob: Today, we have a disease care system not a healthcare system. We respond to crisis, and that\u2019s how we practice medicine. We don\u2019t want to spend money until there\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s how our system is built, and that\u2019s how compensation works. Preventative care is actually healthcare. As a company, we think about cures. We have programs to cure. That\u2019s healthcare versus disease care. We\u2019re starting to see those intellectual shifts that hopefully will lead to change.",

With this backdrop in mind, using TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Eli Lilly (LLY), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) against each other to pick the healthcare stock with the highest upside potential, according to analysts.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is focused on therapeutic areas like diabetes, oncology, immunology, and neurodegeneration. However, the company has been mainly gaining attention for its Type-2 diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss medication Zepbound.\n\nWhile Q3 results fell short of expectations and the company lowered its full-year adjusted profit guidance, the demand for these blockbuster drugs remains strong. Eli Lilly has been making significant investments to boost the production of these drugs.\n\nAside from meeting the robust demand for its glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist drugs, such as Mounjaro and Zepbound, the company is also focused on capturing opportunities across other therapeutic areas. Moreover, it is optimistic about approvals of these two drugs for other indications. Remarkably, Zepbound recently won the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) approval for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nRecently, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott reiterated a Buy rating on Eli Lilly stock with a price target of $1,100. Despite expectations of Eli Lilly arriving at the lower end of the Q4 2024 guidance, Schott is optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects in 2025 and beyond. He expects growth to be driven by higher sales from Mounjaro and Zepbound, fueled by increased supply, a rise in promotional activities, and broader label coverage for Zepbound.\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Eli Lilly stock based on 15 Buys and two Hold ratings. The average LLY stock price target of $1,050.79 implies 37.3% upside potential. Shares have risen 24% over the past year. LLY stock offers a dividend yield of 0.67%.\n\nSee more LLY analyst ratings\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nHealthcare company Abbott Laboratories has a diversified presence across diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. After facing a setback during the pandemic, the company\u2019s key division, Medical Devices, has been rebounding well and delivered about a 12% revenue growth in Q3 2024. It offset the weakness in the Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses.\n\nLooking ahead, Abbott is optimistic about its diversified business model and new products. Notably, it is upbeat about Lingo, a continuous glucose monitoring system available without a prescription, which was launched in the U.S. in September 2024.\n\nIs ABT a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nLast month, TD Cowen analyst Josh Jennings reiterated a Buy rating on ABT stock and increased the price target to $135 from $130. The analyst believes that there are multiple tailwinds that can help the company sustain continued growth in 2025. He added that the revised price target reflects a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of 23.5 times the 2026 EPS estimate of $5.75.\n\nThe analyst noted that at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference held in October 2024, Abbott reviewed its Structural Heart business and gave favorable information on the company\u2019s TriClip, Navitor, and Amulet offerings, which are all gaining market share in the domestic market. The analyst is optimistic that these products can supplement MitraClip\u2019s growth and help drive double-digit growth for the overall business.\n\nAmong the other growth drivers, Jennings highlighted the Libre franchise and the company\u2019s solid product pipeline. Jennings noted that the company is comfortable with Wall Street\u2019s 2025 sales and EPS growth estimates of 7% and 10%, respectively.\n\nWith 17 Buys and three Holds, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Abbott Laboratories stock. The average ABT stock price target of $134.06 implies about 19% upside potential. Shares have risen by only 2% over the past year. ABT stock offers a dividend yield of 1.95%.\n\nSee more ABT analyst ratings\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)\n\nIntuitive Surgical is a dominant player in the minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery space. The company is mainly known for its da Vinci Surgical System. ISRG shares have rallied 68% over the past year, thanks to the increased adoption of the company\u2019s da Vinci systems. As of the end of Q3 2024, the da Vinci surgical system\u2019s installed base expanded by 15% year-over-year to 9,539 systems.\n\nIt is worth noting that a substantial portion of the company\u2019s revenue is recurring in nature and includes instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. Specifically, recurring revenue accounted for 86% of ISRG\u2019s total revenue in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter results on January 23, 2025. The analyst expects the company\u2019s adjusted EPS to increase by more than 9% to $1.75 in Q4 2024 and revenue to rise 14.3% to $2.20 billion. ISRG has exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates for seven consecutive quarters.\n\nIs Intuitive Surgical a Good Investment?\n\nIn a research note on the MedTech sector\u2019s prospects in 2025, Bank of America (BofA) stated that Intuitive Surgical and Boston Scientific (BSX) remain its top picks for the third consecutive year. Analysts at Bank of America noted that both these companies delivered solid EPS growth in 2024. While the two companies might lack similar tailwinds for valuation growth in 2025 compared to last year, their consistent top-line growth and EPS upside might continue to make them attractive.\n\nSpecifically, BofA analysts view Intuitive Surgical as a leader in surgical robotics, with its da Vinci system well-positioned for further growth through technological advancements and broader geographic adoption.\n\nOverall, ISRG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and four Hold recommendations. At $570, the average ISRG stock price target implies 5.1% upside potential.\n\nSee more ISRG analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is optimistic about the long-term prospects of Eli Lilly, Abbott Laboratories, and Intuitive Surgical. However, analysts see higher upside potential in Eli Lilly compared to the other two healthcare stocks. Analysts are optimistic about Eli Lilly due to the substantial demand for its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, and opportunities across other key therapeutic areas.\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "Eliminating the heparin-inhibition step of standard heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) screening could reduce manual work for laboratorians performing HIT diagnostic testing while improving clinical accuracy, according to a study published January 3 in the Journal of Applied Laboratory Medicine (JALM).\n\nThis study also addresses utilization of confirmatory serotonin release assays (SRAs) and unnecessary hematology consults, according to the authors. A best-practice advisory or restriction for SRA testing could be implemented based on the findings, they concluded.\n\nFor years, testing for HIT, an adverse drug reaction to the blood thinner heparin, has included screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmatory SRAs, wherein SRA testing can be pursued following a positive ELISA result, explained Dr. Meredith Parsons and colleagues from the University of Iowa Health Care System Department of Pathology for their retrospective study.\n\nHIT is challenging from a diagnostic stewardship standpoint, the authors noted. However, performing manual HIT ELISA testing according to manufacturers' recommendations (i.e., tested both with and without additional heparin to determine percent inhibition) is resource-intensive for the clinical laboratory.\n\n\"The utility of heparin inhibition has been evaluated on multiple occasions,\" noted Parsons and colleagues, adding that the University of Iowa study is novel in its real-world analysis of the impact of data-driven changes in ELISA interpretation.\n\nA key finding of the study is that pre-intervention ELISA interpretation reliance on percent inhibition (testing samples in high-heparin and low-heparin conditions in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations) has likely led to overutilization of non-heparin anticoagulants and the pursuit of SRA testing in situations where SRA was very unlikely to be positive, according to Parsons and colleagues.\n\nConfirmatory SRA testing itself also poses some problems, the authors noted. As a send-out test, SRA can take three to five days to result. This can delay reinitiation of heparin anticoagulation in those ultimately found not to have HIT. Non-heparin anticoagulants used in the meantime are more expensive, more difficult to reverse, and more challenging to monitor, the authors said.\n\nFor the University of Iowa study, the team considered the current 4T scoring system for HIT risk stratification. Very few clinicians outside of hematology are well-versed in using the system, and most are also unaware of the intricacies of HIT testing, Parsons and colleagues said. There is also a lack of agreement on the ideal interpretation of HIT ELISA testing.\n\nThe team queried the electronic medical record (EMR; Epic) for records from December 7, 2016, to December 31, 2021, for all HIT ELISA and SRA tests performed. The researchers saw that ELISA testing was performed irrespective of the 4T score entered.\n\nThat analysis motivated data-driven changes in ELISA reporting and HIT management recommendations in November 2023, according to the authors. In the post-intervention period, ELISA interpretation moved to low-heparin optical density (OD).\n\nOD is the main measurement of HIT ELISA testing, explained the authors, adding that higher OD values are measured when there are increased antibody/PF4-heparin complex interactions in a sample through which the transmittance of light is hindered, and lower OD values are measured when light can pass through a sample with less obstruction from complex formation.\n\nThe researchers assessed the impact of changes: pre-intervention (from June 8, 2023 to November 7, 2023) and post-intervention (from November 29, 2023 to April 28, 2024). Ordering of both ELISA and SRA tests remained unrestricted at all periods during the study.\n\nAnalyzing the lab results of over 1,011 ELISA tests and 169 SRA tests, Parsons' team found that OD coupled with certain recommendations:\n\nDecreased ELISA positivity rates (13% to 5%)\n\nDecreased rates of SRA confirmatory testing overall (13% to 9%)\n\nDecreased SRA testing rates for patients with non-negative ELISAs (78% to 43%)\n\nIncreased heparin resumption (20% to 57%)\n\nHematology consults remained relatively stable (78% to 86%)\n\n\"Since the heparin inhibition step was demonstrated to not add value, it no longer contributes to the ELISA interpretation post-intervention, and differentiation between equivocal and positive ELISA results is instead based entirely on low-heparin OD,\" stated Parsons and colleagues.\n\nThe team found that low-heparin OD-based HIT ELISA interpretation yielded enhanced positive predictive value (PPV), or true cases, compared with percent inhibition-based interpretation.\n\n\"Positive SRA results never followed an ELISA with a low-heparin OD below 1.0, though they were observed following ELISAs with percent inhibition values spanning 0% to 100%,\" Parsons and colleagues wrote.\n\nIn addition, prior to the intervention, hematology consults were recommended for any non-negative ELISA result, whereas they are only recommended for equivocal ELISA results post-intervention, they said. Hematology was still consulted unnecessarily in all positive ELISAs and appropriately for three of four equivocal ELISA results in the post-intervention period, they found. None of the post-intervention SRAs were recommended by hematology, nor were they recommended in the post-intervention algorithm.\n\n\"Elimination of the heparin inhibition step significantly simplifies manual work for laboratorians performing the testing, saves reagent costs, and increases testing throughput,\" Parsons and colleagues concluded. \"The removal of heparin inhibition also simplifies ELISA reporting and increases its utility for clinicians in guiding next steps in patient management.\"\n\nLooking ahead, retrospective reassessment of 4T score accuracy by trained professionals, such as hematologists and pharmacists, may improve 4T score predictive value for both ELISA and SRA testing, the authors noted. This could be a potentially fruitful avenue of future study and/or intervention, they said.\n\nWhile the authors acknowledged the study's limitations, they emphasized that, regardless, inappropriate SRA ordering adds to diagnostic testing costs without providing additional actionable information and could potentially be decreased through the linkage of management recommendations to ELISA resulting in the EMR so that management recommendations are available at time of ELISA result review.\n\nThe study is featured in a special issue of JALM highlighting the value of diagnostic stewardship, a collaborative approach to enhancing clinical laboratory testing.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other January dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks fell short of investor expectations, largely due to the continuing AI boom and a heightened interest in technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrats index lagged behind the broader market during the year. However, analysts remain optimistic about the future of dividend equities. This positive sentiment is driven by the fact that many US companies have ample cash reserves to sustain their dividend payments. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reported that large-cap US companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash, which could be used to either start or enhance dividend payouts.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024\n\nDespite the lack of enthusiasm for dividend stocks, analysts believe they still offer attractive entry points for investors. Capital Group suggested seeking opportunities in dividend-paying companies that the market has overlooked. This includes pharmaceutical firms that have been neglected due to the current focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and certain banks. Within the dividend space, investors are increasingly drawn toward dividend growth stocks that offer consistent yields. Stocks that pay dividends and boast solid balance sheets with attractive yields can provide reliable income, protect against market declines, and support healthy investment growth. A report by ProShares highlighted that since its inception, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For instance, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023.\n\nThe report also mentioned that the index has demonstrated strong performance in both up and down markets, with an upside capture of 91% and a downside capture of 80%. It has shown notable resilience during market downturns, outperforming the wider market by more than 12% in 2022. In addition, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the market in eight of the 10 worst quarterly declines since 2005.\n\nSince the start of 2025, the broader market has only seen a modest increase of 0.66%. In this environment, UBS has identified stocks that are considered high quality compared to their peers and are unlikely to reduce their current dividend payouts. The firm estimates a 22.9% chance of dividend cuts across various regions and sectors, noting that the US remains the most secure region for dividends, with only a 6.2% likelihood of cuts. Moreover, most sectors in the US appear relatively stable. Japan stands out as the most favorable region for dividend growth, with a projected growth rate of 9.9%.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Wearable Patch Market by Type, by Technology, by Application, by End-User, and By Region\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global wearable patch market is estimated to be USD 9.98 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 23.65 billion by 2035, with a CAGR of 8.16% during the forecast period 2025-2035.\n\nThe market will grow due to factors such as the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, wearable technology advancements, the growing need for remote patient monitoring, the growing use of clinical trials and drug delivery, and increased investments made by major healthcare corporations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWearable patches work better and provide a better user experience when technologies like IoT, AI, and data analytics are integrated. For instance, in May 2023, Monash University researchers created a wearable patch driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that tracks a variety of health indicators, such as voice, neck movement, touch, respiration, and heart rates. The ultra-thin patch, which is worn around the neck, provides a complete solution for remote health monitoring by automatically tracking and analyzing these biometrics using a frequency/amplitude-based neural network.\n\n\n\nBy type, the glucose patch segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global wearable patch market in 2024 owing to the rising prevalence of diabetes and the increasing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring systems for non-invasive, real-time blood glucose management. For instance, a new arm patch enables non-diabetics to use their smartphones to monitor their blood sugar levels in real-time, according to Euronews statistics released in May 2024. Continuous glucose monitoring is provided by this wearable patch, assisting users in maintaining balanced energy levels and making wise dietary decisions. Additionally, the heart rate and ECG patch segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and increasing awareness about early diagnosis through remote monitoring solutions.\n\n\n\nBy technology, the connected wearable segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global wearable patch market in 2024 and is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its ability to provide real-time health data through IoT connectivity, facilitating remote patient monitoring and seamless integration with digital healthcare platforms. For instance, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and digital health startup Epicore Biosystems teamed in February 2024 to employ the latter's cutting-edge wearable sweat-sensing technology for drug detection. Using sweat analysis in conjunction with conventional urine and blood tests, the Discovery Patch is a single-use, flexible microfluidic patch that improves anti-doping efforts and offers real-time hydration insights.\n\n\n\nBy application, the non-clinical segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global wearable patch market in 2024 owing to the increasing use of wearable patches for fitness tracking and wellness monitoring among health-conscious consumers. For instance, Luxnine's BodyLog chest patch, which won the CES 2024 Innovation Award in May 2024, provides post-incident analysis, fall detection, and real-time vital sign monitoring. It monitors respiration, heart rate, and oxygen levels, providing ongoing health monitoring and lifestyle recommendations to help with elder care. It also evaluates the severity of incidents and examines heart rate variability (HRV) following emergencies and falls. Additionally, the clinical segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its widespread adoption in chronic disease management, postoperative care, and telehealth services.\n\n\n\nBy end-user, the hospital's segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global wearable patch market in 2024 owing to the high demand for advanced monitoring systems for inpatient care and post-surgical recovery management. For instance, researchers at California University in San Diego have created a wearable ultrasonic patch for continuous, non-invasive cerebral blood flow monitoring, per data published in May 2024 in ScienceDaily. The drawbacks of conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasound are overcome by this flexible, soft patch that can be worn on the temple and offers three-dimensional information on blood flow in the brain. Additionally, the home care settings segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the increasing preference for home-based healthcare, wearable technology advancements, and remote monitoring solutions' cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\nThe North American region is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the widespread adoption of advanced healthcare technologies, a growing prevalence of chronic diseases, a well-established healthcare infrastructure, and increased consumer awareness about wearable health monitoring devices. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising healthcare expenditures, increasing adoption of wearable technologies in emerging economies, a large population base with unmet medical needs, and rapid advancements in digital health ecosystems. For instance, in November 2023, researchers from Australia and India developed a small, lightweight, gel-free hexagonal ECG patch that they claim is perfect for point-of-care detection. These portable ECG patches have the potential to transform distant and ambulatory healthcare, as well as possibly preventative medicine. The market is expanding due to the increasing need for remote patient monitoring and preventative healthcare practices.\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive research report focuses on the global and regional market size and forecasts from 2024 to 2035.\n\n\n\nReport Scope:\n\nMarket Forecast by Type, Technology, Application, and End-User\n\nMarket Forecast for 5 Regions and 17+ Countries North America (U.S. and Canada) Europe (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Russia, Rest of Europe) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, Rest of APAC) Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of LATAM) MEA (South Africa, GCC, Rest of MEA)\n\nCompany Profiles of the Top 10+ Major Market Players: Abbott Laboratories Medtronic Philips Healthcare Johnson & Johnson Omron Healthcare Dexcom Nokia Health GlucoWatch iRhythm Technologies Insulet Corporation Tactile Medical VitalConnect Qardio Myant BioTelemetry, Inc.\n\n\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2023 - 2034 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2023 $9.98 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2034 $23.65 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.1% Regions Covered Global\n\nReport Segmentation:\n\nWearable Patch Market Analysis & Forecast by Type 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nTemperature Patch\n\nGlucose Patch\n\nHeart rate and ECG Patch\n\nOthers\n\nWearable Patch Market Analysis & Forecast by Technology 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nRegular Wearable\n\nConnected Wearable\n\nWearable Patch Market Analysis & Forecast by Application 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nClinical\n\nNon-clinical\n\nWearable Patch Market Analysis & Forecast by End-User 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nHospitals\n\nAmbulatory Surgical Centers\n\nHomecare Settings\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/8pgbbx\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a hydrophilic bile acid that mediates its biological effects via several mechanisms. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) protects hepatocytes and cholangiocytes from bile acid-induced damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. UDCA was shown to reserve hepatocyte cell structures and stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways.It was also shown to prevent the production of ROS by Kupffer cells and resident macrophages in the liver, thus attenuating oxidative stress in the liver.\n\nLast year, the expert panel at its 09th/24 meeting held on 12.09.2024 opined that the firm should revise the protocol with respect to the following points:\n\n1. The firm shall define the normal ALT value for both males and females. The difference in ALT levels normalization has to be compared among the placebo arm and the test arm. And also, the ALT reduction value shall be defined as a percentage decrease from the baseline normal level.\n\n2. Primary and secondary objectives shall be redefined to make the study a clinically meaningful outcome. The primary endpoint shall include fibroscan investigation at baseline and at six months of study duration, and the protocol shall also incorporate normalization of ALT value as an endpoint.\n\n3.

            "content": "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse has unquestionably achieved much of its intended purpose.\n\nThe burden of chasing down former employers of drivers in an effort to obtain drug and alcohol testing results has changed drastically. The required information is now just a query away in the Clearinghouse.\n\nNo more playing the system\n\nOne key benefit is that drivers who failed drug or alcohol tests are no longer able to apply to carrier after carrier in an attempt to find one that won\u2019t perform background checks before making a hire.\n\nClearinghouse regulations specify that those drivers shouldn\u2019t be eligible to perform safety-sensitive functions until they undergo a return to duty (RTD) program administered by a substance abuse professional (SAP) \u2014 but without a sound reporting system, states that issued CDLs to those drivers remained unaware.\n\nAll of that began to change in January 2017, the effective date of rule that established the Clearinghouse. Carriers are now required to report testing results to a central entity and query the same entity to review the records of prospective drivers.\n\nOf course, it took a few years for the Clearinghouse database to build, but carriers could now determine if a driver was in a prohibited status with a few mouse clicks.\n\nPhase II now in effect\n\nA second final ruling, known as \u201cClearinghouse II,\u201d took effect on November 18, 2024.\n\nUnder the provisions of the ruling, state driver\u2019s licensing agencies (SDLAs) are now required to downgrade the licenses of any driver in a \u201cprohibited\u201d status until they\u2019ve completed an RTD program as recorded in the Clearinghouse.\n\nBefore Phase II went into effect, state agencies had the ability to submit queries; however, the individual computer systems in each state weren\u2019t always able to communicate with the Clearinghouse to receive status changes in a timely manner.\n\nNow, all that\u2019s changed.\n\nOral fluid testing is close\n\nAnother Final Ruling, effective December 5, 2024, clarifies training requirements for Oral Fluid Testing collectors. The ruling may seem irrelevant, given the long wait for the DOT to certify laboratories to test specimens, but it\u2019s an important clarification. The original ruling specified that those who train the collectors have at least a year of experience performing collections, but until the program actually gets underway, no one will have ANY experience.\n\nThe laboratory issue may be sorted soon as well. \u201cWe feel that testing should be able to begin by the end of the 1st quarter in 2025 and should definitely be going by the 2nd quarter,\u201d said Jo McGuire, executive director of the National Drug & Alcohol Screening Association. \u201cAll of the labs are in validity testing with the approved device now.\u201d\n\nMcGuire remarked that it\u2019s important for carriers to be ready when the testing becomes official. \u201cWe are continuing to train trainers and are ready to train collectors as of December 6. Devices are now available to order from Abbott.\u201d Abbott Toxicology will be a supplier of testing supplies and a provider of laboratory services.\n\nThe delay in certification, it appears, occurred because labs didn\u2019t want to invest in supplies and process until testing cut-off levels were established in a Final Rule. Once certain that the levels had not changed from the original proposed rule, progress was made quickly.\n\nBenefits of oral fluid testing\n\nBesides offering another option for testing, Oral Fluid collection eliminates some of the issues around urine testing. Since the need for observed tests is gone, questions of gender and who is qualified to observe are mute. Oral fluid collection does away with shy bladder incidents as well as dilution or alteration of specimens.\n\nCollection facility regulations are reduced as well, since the need for a private bathroom is eliminated, as are requirements to restrict access to water.\n\nImpact on carrier policy\n\nDuring the 2024 Accelerate! Conference and Expo hosted by the Women In Trucking Association, a distinguished panel of drug and alcohol policy experts moderated by McGuire discussed the need for each carrier to have a strong policy that is clearly communicated. That policy should include the carrier\u2019s right to use Oral Fluid testing at its discretion.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be in the policy for pre-employment,\u201d said Mia Hicks, manager of risk and compliance at DISA Global Solutions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this and if it escalates, we\u2019re going to do that.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t wait to update policies\n\nEven with constantly shifting processes, motor carrier policies need to be clear and must be shared with everyone concerned prior to actual testing. Prospective drivers should be informed that they will be subject to any form of testing for drugs and alcohol that the carrier deems appropriate, within the laws and regulations in effect at the time of testing.\n\nStill waiting for hair follicle testing\n\nA long-awaited ruling about another form of testing still hasn\u2019t happened. The use of Hair Follicle Testing for DOT supervised employees, included in the FAST Act that became effective in December 2015, has still not been approved for use. In fact, the Spring 2024 Unified Agenda published by the Department of Health and Human Services called for a proposed rulemaking by October 2024 to include hair testing in Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs. It didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cI recently heard a great quote that summarizes this slow walk in a nutshell,\u201d said David Heller, senior vice president of safety and government affairs for the Truckload Carriers Association. \u201cInnovators will beat regulators every time, which is evidenced by the success stories of motor carriers across the country that have adopted hair follicle testing for their own programs.\u201d\n\nWhile hair follicle testing results are not currently shared in the Clearinghouse, some carriers have been using the technology as a supplement to the USDOT\u2019s testing regimen. Hair follicle testing has proven superior to urine testing for identifying drug use much farther in the past, and it provides many of the benefits of oral fluid testing, such as gender issues and elimination of the need for bathrooms.\n\n\u201cTCA has not been quiet on this issue,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThis topic has been discussed with both regulators and legislators in DC, and it will continue to be brought up until our industry has guidelines that will allow for this alternative measure.\u201d",

In some U.S. states physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists , clinical psychologists , and other medical professionals are permitted to write prescriptions in addition to doctors . Prescription drugs are generally divided into two categories: brand-name drugs and generic drugs . [2] [3]\n\nWith 79% of Americans saying prescription drug costs are \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and 70% reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority, the popular debate over prescription drugs is not whether drug costs should be reduced but how they should be reduced. One consideration is whether the U.S. federal government should regulate prescription drug prices. [1]\n\nAlthough there is speculation about how drug companies price drugs\u2014including consideration of competing drugs, medical uniqueness, and the overall market\u2014drug companies are not required to reveal how or why a drug is priced as it is, why or when a drug price may be raised, or why drug costs sometimes exceed research and development (R&D) expenses for the drug. [4] [8]\n\nIn 2020 total global drug company revenue totaled more than $1.27 trillion, which included revenue from the manufacturers\u2019 sale of drugs and other products (such as shampoo and baby products). Drug sales accounted for about $904 billion in revenue. Johnson & Johnson had $82.6 billion in total 2020 revenue, the highest for any drug company worldwide, $45.5 billion of which was from drug sales. Roche followed at a distant second, with $62.05 billion in total 2020 revenue, $49.5 of which was from drug sales. Global drug revenue is expected to continue to rise. [5] [6] [7]\n\nIn the United States, drug companies (also called pharmaceutical companies ) set prescription drug prices, which are largely unregulated by the federal government. Some drug companies will be familiar because their names have been attached to COVID-19 vaccines or other common products\u2014Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer , for example. Others may not be household names but command large portions of the market nonetheless: Swiss companies Roche and Novartis , to name two. [4]\n\nAccording to the Rand Corporation , prescription drug prices in the United States were 2.56 times higher on average than prices in 32 other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, with brand-name drugs coming in at 3.44 times higher. While generic drugs in the U.S. cost slightly less than the global average and accounted for 84% of drugs sold, they made up only 12% of total drug spending in the United States. Total drug spending in the countries included in the study was estimated to be $795 billion, and the U.S. accounted for 58% of sales and 24% of volume. [11]\n\nThe cost to the patient is determined by three agents. The first is the drug company, which sets a price for a drug it has developed or purchased from another company. The second is pharmacy benefit managers, who negotiate rebates and savings on behalf of health insurance companies, Medicare Part D drug plans, large employers, and other groups. (These agreements, however, are generally not publicly disclosed, so actual cost savings to patients are unknown). The third agent is health insurance companies, which determine which drugs will be approved for their customers\u2019 use, how much the insurance company will pay for the drugs, and how much patients will pay. Patients may not know their out-of-pocket cost for a drug until standing in line at the pharmacy, and, because of disparate insurance coverage, one patient may pay more than another for the same drug. [8] [9] [10]\n\nThe second was a bill passed by the House on Mar. 31, 2022, that would have limited the cost of insulin to $35 a month\u201425% of the insurance plan\u2019s negotiated price, whichever was lower\u2014but it too died in the Senate. [13] [14]\n\n\u201cAllow the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D\n\nTwo legislative efforts to reduce prescription drug prices came before the U.S. Senate , having passed the House of Representatives in 2021 and 2022. The first was a provision in the Build Back Better Act, passed by the House on Nov. 19, 2021, which died in the Senate in 2022. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the act would have done the following, among other things:\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Florida to import prescription drugs from Canada . The authorization was the first in the country but just the first step in the importation of prescription drugs to Florida . Canada has restrictions in place to prevent the export of drugs if doing so \u201cwill\u2026cause or exacerbate a drug shortage in Canada.\u201d The population of Florida is roughly half that of Canada, and Canada has had shortages of drugs, from cancer medications to weight-loss and diabetes medications, making export unlikely, according to experts. [44] [45] [46]\n\nSection 804 of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) \u201callows importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada to: significantly reduce the cost of these drugs to the American consumer, without imposing additional risk to public health and safety.\u201d [1] [2] [47]\n\nFor doctors to be able to meet their patients\u2019 needs, they must have accurate cost information. One way to ensure that they do is via congressional action to make costs transparent and drugs more affordable.\n\nRobert Popovian, a pharmaceutical economist, asked, \u201cWe know that the correct data exist, so why don\u2019t physicians have access to it when they are prescribing these medications?\u201d [10]\n\nAs Lipoff explained, \u201cDoctors must remember our responsibility to consider the whole patient, including his or her financial livelihood, and make a point of bringing up the cost of care with each of our patients. If patients with limited means spend more money on medications, that expense means less money for the rest of their budget, with real consequences. With better transparency and advocacy on behalf of our patients, we as physicians must strive for the most cost-effective care.\u201d [25]\n\nJules Lipoff, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, stated, \u201cPatients appreciate it when doctors have a well-thought-out backup plan (for example, an over-the-counter or other prescription alternative) and bring up costs during an office visit. Patients do not like being told reflexively to call if there\u2019s an issue filling the medication at the pharmacy\u2014that puts the responsibility on them to figure out a complicated system.\u201d [25]\n\nWithout prescription drug cost information, doctors are left to guess. In a survey of 371 primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and rheumatologists who were given insurance information for a hypothetical patient, only 20% correctly determined the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for a drug that costs $1,000 per month. [10]\n\nAmong physicians, 74% believe considering patients\u2019 medical benefits is important when choosing which drug to prescribe. And 59% want to be able to compare drug costs at the point of prescription. However, 29% of physicians do not trust the information they have access to about prescription drug costs. Additionally, 59% reported that knowledge of their patients\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug costs is \u201chigh-priority,\u201d but only 11% have easy access to that information. [24]\n\nDoctors frequently do not know, and may not have access to, prescription drug costs for their patients. Because patients have a variety of insurance policies with varying prescription drug coverage, doctors are left to prescribe drugs without knowing whether the patients will be able to afford the drug at the pharmacy. [18]\n\nMillionaire Martin Shkreli was dubbed the \u201cmost hated man in America\u201d for raising the price of Daraprim, an AIDS drug, from $13.50 a pill to $750. And other drugs have seen similar increases. Why did drug companies raise the costs of these drugs? As journalist Emily Willingham stated, \u201cbecause they could.\u201d Life-sustaining and life-saving medications should not be subject to the whims of corporations and millionaires. [20] [22] [23]\n\nEpiPen, a life-saving drug for patients who experience severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings or certain foods, contains about $1 worth of epinephrine and cost about $57 in 2007. The price jumped 400% when the drug company Mylan acquired the drug that same year, raising the cost to $500 or more. Even an insured patient could pay upward of $400. Raising the price allowed the drug to account for 40% of Mylan\u2019s operating profits in 2015. [19] [20] [21]\n\nDrug prices are first set by drug companies, which have an interest in recouping R&D costs and raising corporate revenues. Drug costs are then negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers, which are private companies interested in profit. Pharmacy benefit managers keep a portion of rebates, which are negotiated without public disclosure, and some health insurance companies have reported seeing none of the rebates. Then consumer drug prices are set by insurance companies, which also want to increase their bottom lines. Without government regulation, drug prices can be increased by the drug companies, rebates can be withheld by the pharmacy benefit managers, and insurance companies can refuse to cover a drug, leaving patients with few options. [8] [9] [18]\n\nAs explained by Truth in Rx, an American Medical Association campaign for drug price transparency, \u201cPrescription drug price increases can lead some patients to not be able to afford critical medicine\u2026.The result? Among this group, three in ten say their condition got worse.\u201d [18]\n\nBecause of high drug costs, 29% of adults surveyed in the Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they did not take their medication or medications as prescribed, 19% did not fill a prescription, 18% took an over-the-counter (OTC) drug instead, and 12% cut pills in half or skipped doses. Similar results were found among respondents to a Healio Internal Medicine poll. [15] [17]\n\nTori Marsh, director of research at GoodRx, explained some of the consequences of having to buy expensive prescription drugs: \u201cIn 2020, 20.7% of people reported taking on debt or declaring bankruptcy due to the cost of their prescription medications. Borrowing from friends or family was the most common financial action (16.8%), followed by getting loans (5.0%), taking out another mortgage (1.2%), and filing for bankruptcy (1.0%).\u201d [16]\n\nSome 24% of people taking prescription drugs in the U.S. reported difficulty affording the drugs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Moreover, 58% of people whose drugs cost more than $100 a month, 49% of people in fair or poor health, 35% of those with annual incomes of less than $40,000, and 35% of those taking four or more drugs monthly all reported affordability issues. Additionally, 30% of people aged 50 to 64 reported cost issues because they generally take more drugs than younger people but are not old enough to qualify for Medicare drug benefits. [15]\n\n\u2014Ezekiel Emanuel, \u201cOpinion: Why We Can Have Both Innovative Drugs and Lower Drug Prices,\u201d politico.com , Oct. 13, 2021\n\nI\u2019m an oncologist who has seen his patients reap huge benefits from the kind of high-priced innovation drug companies love to talk about. I\u2019m also a health-policy specialist who has looked carefully at the long-term impact of drug company prices and profits. I\u2019m convinced that we don\u2019t have to choose between reasonable prices and innovation. The truth is, if Congress passes legislation to give Medicare negotiating power to make drugs more affordable, we will still have robust innovation.\u201d\n\nExcessively high prescription drug prices are a substantial financial burden on Americans,\u2026but they also raise insurance premiums and taxes for you and me by increasing costs for insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. Society will pay the other $200,000 through those higher premiums and taxes\u2026.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the undisputed global leader in drug research and development, and pharmaceutical companies warn that imposing controls on drug prices\u2014like those currently being debated in Congress\u2014will stifle that innovation. But many Americans, including the well insured, cannot afford the innovative drugs produced by that research\u2026.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and the chair of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, stated,\n\nThe reason: Large pharmaceutical companies are nowhere near as important to real drug innovation as they purport to be. Furthermore, smart policy changes can sustain and increase the pace of life-changing breakthroughs in biomedicine through increased funding of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cutting the costs and accelerating the speed of clinical trials, and reforming patent law to stop innovation-blocking abuses used by Big Pharma to prevent new drugs from entering the market.\u201d\n\nThis is a false choice. We need not trade the certainty of saved lives now for the possibility of saved lives in the future.\n\n\u201cLegislation giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices in the United States would make their life-saving potential immediately available to millions of Americans who cannot now afford them, thus extending lives and alleviating suffering. The pharmaceutical industry, however, has done a masterful job of arguing that these Americans must suffer in the short term since lower prices would gut long-term innovation in drug development.\n\nDavid Blumenthal, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, Mark E. Miller, an executive vice president of health care for Arnold Ventures, and Lovisa Gustafsson, a vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, stated,\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this from people across the country who have serious illnesses and can\u2019t afford their medicine. What a painstaking position to be in. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cFixing prescription drug pricing has consistently been a top issue for Americans year-after-year, including the vast majority of both Democrats and Republicans who want to see a change because they simply cannot afford their medications.\n\n\u2014Nicole Rapfogel and Thomas Waldrop, \u201cCongress Can Act Now to Lower Drug Costs by Allowing Medicare to Negotiate Prices,\u201d americanprogress.org , Feb. 1, 2022\n\nSenators have the power to meaningfully lower prices for some of the nation\u2019s most expensive drugs\u2014drugs that treat cancer, prevent blood clots, and treat autoimmune disorders. Passing drug price negotiations and other key drug reforms is a critical step toward lowering drug costs for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nCongress has the opportunity to pass drug pricing legislation that would be life-changing for millions of older adults. More than 4 in 5 seniors think drug costs are unreasonable. Senators should take the overwhelmingly popular step of enabling the federal government to negotiate prices. Lowering drug prices through negotiation, inflationary rebates, and insulin and cost-sharing caps would allow people\u2014especially those with chronic conditions and disabilities\u2014to access the treatment they need.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of prescription drugs is a major concern for many Americans. Nearly 9 in 10 older adults take prescription medication, yet high drug prices are leading to soaring out-of-pocket costs, dangerous drug rationing, and a depletion of limited financial resources\u2014especially for those with fixed incomes\u2026.In particular, the drug pricing provisions\u2026would enable the federal government to finally negotiate drug prices\u2014a policy supported by more than 80 percent of the public\u2026.\n\nAllowing Americans to use the global free market without more government interference is the most effective way to force American drug companies to lower prices.\n\nA 2019 Vice investigation found that patients were crossing the border into Mexico to buy Novolog insulin pens for $17 each because the cost in the United States jumped from $289 in 2013 to $540 in 2019. Other insulin prices also rose: Humalog went up from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015, and Lantus from $244 to $431. [36] [37] [38] [39]\n\nAmericans should be able to import drugs from Canada and Mexico. Drug companies lobbied to ban drug imports to prevent competition that would force American companies to reduce their prices. [36] [37] [38] [39]\n\nFurthermore, most Americans support allowing drug imports from Canada: 79% of Independents, 78% of Democrats, and 76% of Republicans. [15]\n\nOther free-market options include making more drugs available over the counter (OTC), such as birth control pills and statins, which are available OTC in other countries and would lower costs if available OTC in the United States, and deregulating the ban on marketing or sharing information about drugs in research with insurers and doctors, which would lower advertising costs after FDA approval. [35]\n\nTom Coburn, a late former U.S. senator (R-OK), explained, \u201cThe problem with drug prices\u2026is not that they start out expensive, but that they stay expensive for years after they have been on the market. The main culprit here is the regulatory environment that limits the creation of a free, functioning and competitive market for prescription drugs\u2026.Rather than doubling down on government regulation, we should rely on the free market, which is the best way to allocate these scarce resources, increase competition, lower prices and continue to foster medical innovation for years to come.\u201d [34]\n\nBecause of this requirement, patients should be able to find a drug, covered by insurance, that will treat most conditions. The cost debate is largely over relatively few name-brand drugs. [32] [33]\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies are required to cover at least one drug from every United States Pharmacopeia (USP) category and class. [32] [33]\n\nIf Congress were to expand affordable, quality insurance with appropriate prescription drug coverage, the drug cost problem could be alleviated, if not eliminated, while providing better health care for everyone. [27]\n\nThe study\u2019s authors emphasized that \u201cuninsured individuals were more likely to be in racial minority groups, amplifying pre-existing disparities in healthcare access,\u201d and people who were \u201cuninsured were younger, in poorer health, and\u2026had lower personal income compared with our overall sample.\u201d [30] [31]\n\nA 2021 study found that while drug companies offered rebates to health insurance companies, those rebates did not translate into lower out-of-pocket drug costs for customers. The rebates were tied to higher costs for consumers per prescription drug: $6 for those with commercial insurance, $13 for those with Medicare, and $39 for people without insurance. [30] [31]\n\n\u201cPolicy makers,\u201d suggests Ricks, \u201cneed to focus on fixing broken health [insurance] plan designs that shift too much cost to the sick in order to lower premiums for the healthy.\u201d [29]\n\nHowever, Ricks stated, \u201cWhat the US system does poorly is sharing these negotiated savings with patients who use the medicines. In fact, patient costs for medicines are increasing even while net drug manufacturer prices are decreasing. This paradox exists because no matter how much of a discount an insurer or provider negotiates, most [insurance] plans don\u2019t pass the discount to patients.\u201d [29]\n\nDavid A. Ricks, CEO of drug company Eli Lilly, explained that drug companies negotiate lower prices for government programs including Medicare and for private insurance companies. [29]\n\nDrug companies spent about 25% of revenues on R&D in 2018 and 2019 and were outpaced in R&D spending only by the semiconductor (an electronic component) industry As Investopedia editors summarized, \u201cR&D is the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s lifeblood. The success of major drug companies almost wholly depends upon the discovery and development of new medicines.\u201d [28]\n\nFurthermore, R&D is attached to drug companies\u2019 long-term growth strategy, not only in terms of revenue but also in terms of copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Without R&D and new drugs, the companies could fail to produce the growth and revenue needed to keep older drugs on the market. [28]\n\nDrug companies can more reliably fund R&D for new drugs with revenue from drug sales than they could with venture capital or other outside investments. Studies have shown that cuts in drug companies\u2019 revenue result in drops in future research and the number of new drugs. [26] [27]\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported, \u201cIn 2019, the pharmaceutical industry spent $83 billion dollars on R&D. Adjusted for inflation, that amount is about 10 times what the industry spent per year in the 1980s. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of new drugs approved for sale increased by 60 percent compared with the previous decade, with a peak of 59 new drugs approved in 2018.\u201d [26]\n\nR&D of a new drug costs between almost $1 billion and more than $2 billion. Considering that only approximately 12% of drugs tested are approved by the FDA, the average R&D cost per approved drug is significantly higher (about $12.5 billion). [26]\n\nRemoving the ban would allow the drugmakers to provide easier to digest updates along the way, thereby reducing and spreading the costs of informing medical professionals over a longer period.\u201d\n\nThat ban forces drug companies to spend a lot of money to get the word out about new drugs once they do gain approval\u2026.\n\nThe drug industry would surely like a deregulatory push when it comes to the ban on drug companies sharing information about new drugs with insurers, hospitals and private practice doctors.\n\nOTC drugs also keep third-party insurance companies out the process entirely, also reducing costs and barriers to access.\n\nBirth control medication and most heart disease-fighting statins are over-the-counter drugs in most of the world\u2019s developed countries, but not the U.S. Even if making those drugs OTC doesn\u2019t immediately drop sticker prices, at least it reduces the costs connected with having to go to the doctor every time you need a prescription.\n\nThere are many other free market options that Big Pharma would probably support that would boost supplies of drugs and improve access to them. Chief among them is getting more drugs available over the counter.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to prescription drugs, I believe that reducing government intrusion, rather than increasing it, is the best way to get prices down and expand access to lifesaving treatments\u2026.\n\nThe most pressing needs for policy change are not federal price mandates but rather common-sense adjustments to Medicare Part D and commercial plans. If Congress focuses on capping annual drug spending for Medicare enrollees, ensuring low monthly cost sharing amounts that are predictable each month, and implementing cost-sharing based on what a health plan saved from drug company discounts\u2014millions of patients will see an immediate and dramatic reduction in what they pay at the pharmacy counter.\u201d\n\nWorse, government negotiation to set drug prices won\u2019t address the root cause of the problem America\u2019s seniors have when they buy medicine. Instead, policy makers need to focus on fixing broken health plan designs that shift too much cost to the sick in order to lower premiums for the healthy\u2026.\n\nUnder the guise of Medicare \u201cnegotiations,\u201d the US House of Representatives is considering a measure that would mandate the government to set prices on some of the most widely used drugs. These price controls would shrink the sector by 40 percent or $100 billion per year in revenue. Our entire industry invests about $100 billion per year in research and development.\n\nIf it all sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n\u201cCritics argue that the United States is the only developed country where the federal government doesn\u2019t negotiate prescription drug prices and that a 40 percent cut to the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s size will have limited or no impact on future cures or pandemic preparedness.\n\n\u2014Edmund F. Haislmaier, \u201cRx for Disaster: Democrats\u2019 Bill Shows How Not to Get Affordable, Innovative Prescription Drugs,\u201d heritage.org , Nov. 9, 2021\n\nRather than layering on more counterproductive government regulation, Congress should address government policies driving up prescription drug costs and making it harder to get drugs to market effectively.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the bill\u2019s approach would overturn a decades long bipartisan consensus that the government should create a climate for innovation and lower costs in prescription drugs\u2014without setting prices\u2026.\n\nSuch policies go in the wrong direction. They would hurt access to drugs and innovation, undermine the ability of private plans to negotiate further price discounts for enrollees, and discourage future generic drugs\u2014which often cost less\u2014from coming to market.\n\nSpecifically, in HR 5376 [the Build Back Better Act], the government would set prices in Medicare for a limited number of drugs that account for substantial spending in Medicare.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats have released their latest version of a drug-pricing proposal that would expand government\u2019s role by setting prices for prescription drugs for the first time.\n\nThe single best way to bring down prices is to increase supply and competition; policymakers should remove regulatory barriers to new therapies and follow-on products coming to market, while also working to ensure enforcement of laws targeting anticompetitive practices.\u201d\n\nLegislative changes to drug rebates, like those pursued through rulemaking under the Trump Administration, would ensure that patients with high drug costs receive meaningful assistance.\n\nChristopher Holt, the director of health care policy, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president, of the American Action Forum, stated,\n\n*Data from Switzerland and the United Kingdom were not available for 2004\u201309.\n\nAll costs below are in U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, the United States has maintained the highest costs of 12 OECD countries, increasing from $668.15 in 2004 to $1,126.27 in 2019. Sweden and the U.K. have maintained the lowest prices per person. [48]\n\nSweden covered the least amount of prescription drug costs with private insurance and government programs. And patients paid the least out-of-pocket in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile private insurance and government programs in the United States covered the highest amount of prescription drug costs of ten Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. also had the highest out-of-pocket costs for patients.\n\nFDA-Approved Prescription Drugs Later Pulled from the Market by the FDA\n\nAccording to the FDA, a \u201cdrug is removed from the market when its risks outweigh its benefits. A drug is usually taken off the market because of safety issues with the drug that cannot be corrected, such as when it is discovered that the drug can cause serious side effects that were not known at the time of approval.\u201d The FDA also takes into account the number of people taking a drug being considered for removal so as not to harm those patients.\n\nThe drugs below have been removed from the market by the FDA for various reasons, but the list should not be considered exhaustive. For more information, please consult the FDA\u2019s \u201cRecalls, Market Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts\u201d page or its X (formerly Twitter) account.

            "content": "Cencora, Inc. COR recently completed the previously announced acquisition of Retina Consultants of America (\u201cRCA\u201d), a leading management services organization (\u201cMSO\u201d) of retina specialists.\n\nThis acquisition enhances Cencora's leadership in specialty healthcare and expands its MSO solutions, aiming to deliver greater value to physicians and patients.\n\nLikely Trend of COR Stock Following the News\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares of the company closed flat at $224.74 yesterday. In the past year, COR\u2019s shares have gained 6.8% against the industry\u2019s decline of 12.5%. The S&P 500 has gained 25.9% in the same time frame.\n\nThe acquisition of RCA positions Cencora to capitalize on the growing demand for specialized retinal care. By integrating RCA's advanced care capabilities with its existing specialty healthcare solutions, Cencora can enhance the company\u2019s value proposition to both physicians and patients, potentially driving higher revenue growth. Moreover, the synergies from this acquisition, combined with the raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2025, are likely to bolster investor confidence and create upward momentum in COR's share price in the long term.\n\nMeanwhile, COR currently has a market capitalization of $43.43 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $317.1 million, indicating 7.9% growth from the reported figure of fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDetails on the COR\u2019s Acquisition of RCA\n\nRCA is a prominent network of retina specialists providing advanced care for conditions such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and geographic atrophy.\n\nCencora has acquired an 85% stake in RCA, while some RCA physicians and management team members retain a minority ownership. The deal involved a cash payment of $4.4 billion, which includes costs like transaction fees, debt repayment and cash investments into RCA, with final adjustments expected later. This acquisition strengthens Cencora\u2019s position in specialty healthcare, expands its MSO solutions and aims to deliver greater value to key stakeholders, including doctors and patients.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Cencora has updated its fiscal year 2025 guidance. The company has raised its adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $15.15-$15.45 from the previous range of $14.80-$15.10.\n\nCOR\u2019s Past Strategic Acquisitions\n\nCencora has been actively pursuing acquisitions to enhance its core areas. In 2023, the company acquired a minority stake in OneOncology, a network of leading oncology practices. This acquisition was aimed at strengthening Cencora\u2019s relationship with community oncologists and expanding its specialty solutions in oncology. Additionally, Cencora announced the acquisition of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, further expanding its capabilities in pharmaceutical distribution.\n\nIn a strategic move to diversify its portfolio, Cencora acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, broadening the company\u2019s reach into the growing animal health market. MWI offers a wide range of products, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, capital equipment, supplies, pet food and nutritional products. This acquisition, alongside organic growth, new product innovations and market share gains, has contributed significantly to Cencora\u2019s Other business unit.\n\nIn 2021, Cencora also sealed a deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance, acquiring the majority of it, which is their Alliance Healthcare business, for approximately $6.5 billion. The transaction, which included $6.275 billion in cash and 2 million shares of Cencora common stock, closed in June. This acquisition has enhanced Cencora\u2019s ability to deliver sustained growth through pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services, expanding its scale and service offerings. This positions Cencora for continued leadership and local expertise, strengthening its global footprint and ability to support pharmaceutical innovation.\n\nFavorable Industry Prospects for COR\n\nPer a report by Grand View Research, the global retinal disorder treatment market size was valued at $12.57 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030. The retinal disorder treatment industry is witnessing growth due to factors such as the growing incidence of retinal disorders globally and the need for efficient and cost-effective treatment options. The presence of promising pipeline products is expected to boost the market growth in the forecast period. The rising prevalence of retinal disorders is anticipated to propel market growth over the forecast period.\n\nCOR\u2019s Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCOR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Masimo MASI, Accuray ARAY and Abbott Laboratories ABT.\n\nMasimo, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated growth rate of 11.8% for 2025.

Its earnings missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met in one, delivering an average negative surprise of 141.97%.\n\nARAY\u2019s shares have gained 8.8% against the industry\u2019s 1% decline in the past six months.\n\nAbbott, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 10% for 2025.

            "content": "ResMed Inc. RMD has witnessed strong momentum in the past year. Shares of the company have risen 37.8% compared with 10.7% growth of the industry during the same time frame. The S&P 500 composite has increased 26.2%.\n\nWith healthy fundamentals and strong growth opportunities, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company appears to be a solid wealth creator for its investors at the moment.\n\nResMed designs, manufactures and distributes generators, masks, and related accessories worldwide for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and other respiratory disorders. The company operates under two segments \u2014 Sleep and Respiratory Care and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).\n\nThe Sleep and Respiratory Care segment includes Devices, and Masks and other. Devices include continuous positive airway pressure, variable positive airway pressure and AutoSet systems for the titration and treatment of SDB. ResMed operates the SaaS business in the United States and Germany, including out-of-hospital software platforms.\n\nFactors Favoring RMD\u2019s Share Growth\n\nResMed's share price is trending upward, prompted by robust mask sales, flourishing respiratory care products and complete focus on international expansion. This optimism, led by a solid fiscal first-quarter performance and increasing sales of both operating segments, is expected to contribute further.\n\nInvestors showed optimism about ResMed's AirTouch N30i, the first fabric mask. Additionally, in September, the company launched a few new patient-centric products to enhance the therapy journey for sleep apnea patients. Accordingly, the recent launches bolstered investor confidence in RMD\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nResMed exited the fiscal first quarter of 2025 with impressive results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances were impressive. The growth was driven by robust revenue increase across all product and geographic categories. Moreover, new patient activations as well as the ongoing ReSupply programs contributed to the growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRMD reported an adjusted gross profit of $724.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, marking a 17.5% year-over-year increase. The gross margin improved 324 basis points (bps) to 59.2%. Adjusted operating income rose to $406.4 million, reflecting a 27.7% increase from the fiscal first quarter of 2024, with the adjusted operating margin expanding 431 bps to 33.2%. The improvement in both margins has positively impacted the stock, contributing to its price increase.\n\nFactors That May Offset RMD\u2019s Gains\n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2025, SG&A and R&D expenses rose 7.2% and 5%, respectively, year over year. This was due to headwinds arising from the Middle East conflict, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in capital markets. Furthermore, with sustained inflationary pressures in the future, the company may struggle to keep its operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in check.",

            "content": "Cardinal Health Inc. CAH is well-poised for growth, given its long-term supply agreements, diversified product portfolio and strong quarterly earnings. However, the possibility of losing a major customer remains a risk.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 12.7% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 1.5% growth. The S&P 500 Index has gained 26.2% in the same time frame.\n\nCAH, with a market capitalization of $28.62 billion, is a nationwide drug distributor and service provider to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. The company has an earnings yield of 6.6% compared with the industry's 5.7%. It anticipates earnings to improve 10.2% in the next five years.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReasons Favoring CAH\u2019s Growth\n\nDiversified Product Portfolio: Cardinal Health's Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings give it a competitive edge, with innovations like WaveMark improving clinical lab processes and automation used in more than 2,500 operating rooms. The company also launched cancer screening solutions from FUJIFILM Healthcare Americas and Polymedco to address pandemic-related delays in diagnoses. Additionally, Cardinal Health is seeing growth with its Navista TS product line and the Kendall SCD SmartFlow Compression System, aimed at improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe company is focusing on growth areas like Specialty, At-Home Services and Medical & Pharmaceutical Distribution, including expanding its services through the acquisition of Advanced Diabetes Supply Group. Cardinal Health is investing in its core distribution capabilities, IT infrastructure and differentiated product portfolio to drive long-term growth and adapt to market needs.\n\nLong-term Supply Agreements: Cardinal Health is also pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements with several firms, which have likely kept investors interested. The company entered into a long-term strategic agreement with Henry Schein. Under this deal, Henry Schein purchased Cardinal Health\u2019s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive core sales and prove accretive to CAH\u2019s earnings in the long term.\n\nThe signing of a 15-year agreement with Bayer Healthcare for the contract manufacturing of Xofigo is significantly positive. In our opinion, this should help CAH leverage its expertise in the nuclear pharmacy industry to expand access to a therapeutic agent and increase the use of radiopharmaceuticals in the United States and Canada.\n\nStrong Q1 Results: Cardinal Health exited the fiscal first quarter on a positive note, with both earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company continued to witness strong demand for its Pharmaceutical and Specialty solutions. However, sales are likely to be under pressure due to OptumRx contract expiration.\n\nMeanwhile, CAH\u2019s medical products, At-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics are likely to support top-line growth going forward. Improvement in segmental profit looks promising. The expansion of gross margin also bodes well. Cardinal Health also raised its fiscal 2025 guidance for earnings. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be between $7.75 and $7.90, up from the previous guidance of $7.55-$7.70.\n\nFactors That May Offset CAH\u2019s Gains\n\nCardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of the loss of a major customer, which, in turn, can severely impair its future revenues. In this regard, post the establishment of a generic sourcing joint venture with CVS Caremark in 2014, Cardinal Health largely depends on the former for more than 20% of its revenues.\n\nCollectively, five of Cardinal Health\u2019s main customers, including CVS, accounted for as much as 40% of its revenues. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution contracts with OptumRx ended in June 2024. These represented 17% of total revenues in fiscal 2023. The non-renewal of the contracts is likely to adversely impact CAH\u2019s sales in fiscal 2025.\n\nCAH\u2019s Estimate Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $219.02 billion, indicating a 3.5% decline from the previous year\u2019s level.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pinned at $7.82, indicating a 3.9% increase from the year-ago reported numbers. The consensus estimate for adjusted EPS has remained stable in the past 30 days.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Masimo MASI, Accuray ARAY and Abbott Laboratories ABT.\n\nMasimo, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated growth rate of 11.8% for 2025.

While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has established nutritional and labeling standards for infant formula, these regulations apply only to products intended for children under 12 months of age.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that this results not only in children consuming products of questionable nutritional value, but also states that Abbott Laboratories adds sugar and other unhealthy ingredients in its toddler milk products.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Abbott already faces a growing number of Similac lawsuits over claims that the products increase the risk of premature infants developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is a devastating condition that occurs when an infant\u2019s intestinal tissue becomes inflamed and dies, resulting in the need for emergency surgery and often ending in the infant\u2019s death.",

            "content": "Want some solid dividend growth stocks with incredible track records of increasing their payouts? Here's a list of stocks that have been raising their dividend payments consistently for more than 50 consecutive years. Combined, they add up to 165 years' worth of increases.\n\nThree of the best dividend stocks you can buy and hold today are Target (TGT -3.01%), Hormel Foods (HRL 2.77%), and Abbott Laboratories (ABT 1.31%). Here's why these stocks can be excellent options to add to your portfolio today and just hang on to for the long haul.\n\nTarget: 53 years of increases\n\nIn June 2024, Target announced a 1.8% increase to its dividend, marking the 53rd straight year it has boosted its payout. While that increase may seem modest, Target has been much more generous when business was booming and is not shy in rewarding its shareholders. In 2021, when sales were surging due to pandemic-fueled demand, the company raised its dividend by a whopping 32%. If you go back five years, the dividend has risen by 70%.\n\nTarget's business isn't taking off right now because people are battling inflation and scaling back on discretionary purchases. There's no denying that, and it's a key reason why rival Walmart has been doing better, because it is more heavily skewed toward essentials than discretionary items.\n\nBut this is why now may be the optimal time to invest in Target -- when it may not be performing at its peak. As economic conditions pick up, as they always do, discretionary spending will also recover. When that happens, Target's business will start looking a whole lot better.\n\nWith an attractive 2.9% yield, a low payout ratio of 45%, and the stock trading at just 14 times its trailing earnings, Target is one of the better dividend stocks you can buy right now.\n\nHormel Foods: 59 years of increases\n\nThe most impressive streak on this list belongs to Hormel Foods. In November 2024, the branded food company announced a 3% increase to its dividend, extending its streak of increases to 59 consecutive years. The company owns many popular food brands, including Spam, Planters, Skippy, and dozens more. With the increase in the payout, the stock now yields 3.7% -- well above the S&P 500 average of 1.3%.\n\nOver a period of five years, Hormel has increased its dividend by 25%, which averages out to an annual increase of around 5%. It's a modest but stable bump up that can help investors offset the effects of inflation. The stock's payout ratio of 78% suggests that there is still room for more dividend increases in the future.\n\nThe company is a good, stable option for long-term investors. In the trailing 12 months, Hormel has generated $805 million in profit on revenue totaling $11.9 billion, for a solid net profit margin of just under 7%. Hormel makes for a good, low-volatility stock to add to your portfolio and forget about for a while.\n\nAbbott Laboratories: 53 years of increases\n\nRounding out this list of impressive Dividend Kings is healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories. Just last month, the company raised its dividend by more than 7%. Like Target, this latest increase represented the 53rd consecutive year it has boosted its dividend. At $0.59, the new quarterly dividend is 64% higher than the $0.36 that it was paying shareholders in 2020.\n\nAbbott's yield of just over 2% is the lightest one on this list. But it's still a great stock to own. In addition to the dividend growth, the company offers a lot of long-term stability due to its size and diversification. It's one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, with a market capitalization of around $200 billion, and it has multiple business units, including pharmaceuticals, nutrition, diagnostics, and medical devices. With a payout ratio of 66%, the company can continue making sizable increases to its dividend in the future.\n\nThe business has been doing well. Over the first nine months of 2024, Abbott achieved positive organic growth (excluding COVID-19 tests) in all of its business units, with medical devices looking particularly strong and growing at more than 13% year over year. If you want to diversify your portfolio and invest in a top healthcare stock with a strong dividend, Abbott's a great option to consider.",

More sophisticated treatments are needed for this expanding patient population. The need for efficient treatments is growing as more patients switch to CRPC. The market for CRPC treatments is expanding as a result.\n\nIncreasing Geriatric Population\n\nThe global aging population is a major factor propelling the growth of the castrate-resistant prostate cancer market. The demand for advanced CRPC treatment modalities is heightened by the higher percentage of men entering the geriatric demographic, which is strongly correlated with increased prostate cancer incidence and progression to castrate-resistant stages. In order to handle the expanding patient population, this demographic shift highlights the necessity of focused therapies and all-encompassing management strategies.\n\nRegional Overview\n\nThe study offers market insights for North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nDue to its high incidence of prostate cancer and sophisticated healthcare system, North America held the largest market share in 2024. With its innovative role in cancer detection, the Mayo Clinic demonstrates cutting-edge healthcare infrastructure. Furthermore, the CRPC market dominance is strengthened by the early adoption of cutting-edge treatment modalities, favorable reimbursement policies, and greater awareness of prostate cancer management. Strong regulatory support for innovative treatments and significant R&D expenditures strengthened North America's position as the market leader for CRPC.\n\nThe castrate-resistant prostate cancer market in the Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate over the course of the forecast period due to rising cancer patient incidence brought on by an aging population and shifting lifestyle choices. The need for advanced CRPC treatments is increasing in the area due to growing numbers, increased awareness, and easier access to healthcare.\n\nRecent Progress in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Market\n\nAugust 2023: The US FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's AKEEGA (Abiraterone Acetate and Niraparib), making it the first dual-action tablet for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that is BRCA-positive. By targeting genetic vulnerabilities and blocking androgen signaling, this novel formulation enhances treatment efficacy in this particular patient group by combining an androgen receptor inhibitor with a PARP inhibitor.\n\nMay 2023: Novartis agreed to purchase Mariana Oncology, a preclinical biotech company based in Watertown, Massachusetts, that specializes in developing innovative radioligand therapies (RLTs) for malignancies with significant unmet needs. Novartis' strategic oncology priorities are in line with this acquisition, which strengthens the company's RLT pipeline and expands its clinical supply and research capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nInquire more about this report before purchase:\n\nhttps://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/castrate-resistant-prostate-cancer-market/inquire-before-buying?utm_source=gnw&utm_medium=gnw&utm_campaign=globe&utm_id=01\n\nCastrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Market Segmentation\n\nBy Therapy Outlook (Revenue, USD Billion; 2020\u20132034)\n\nChemotherapy\n\nHormonal Therapy\n\nImmunotherapy\n\nRadiotherapy\n\nBy Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Billion; 2020\u20132034)\n\nNorth America US Canada\n\nEurope Germany France UK Italy Spain Netherlands Russia Rest of Europe\n\nAsia Pacific China Japan India Malaysia South Korea Indonesia Australia Vietnam Rest of Asia Pacific\n\nMiddle East & Africa Saudi Arabia UAE Israel South Africa Rest of Middle East & Africa\n\nLatin America Mexico Brazil Argentina Rest of Latin America\n\n\n\nBrowse More Research Reports:\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostics Market\n\nTargeted Protein Degradation Market\n\nMedical Batteries Market\n\nMetastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma Treatment Market\n\nBlood Pressure Cuffs Market\n\nAbout Polaris Market Research & Consulting, Inc:\n\nPolaris Market Research is a global market research and consulting company.

You may be eligible for monetary compensation by filing a claim against the maker of the baby formula, and our dedicated attorneys specializing in NEC baby formula cases are here to support you.\n\nAs of November 2023, more than 275 lawsuits against Mead Johnson regarding toxic baby formula and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are still pending. These cases have been consolidated into MDL 3026 in Illinois, under the supervision of U.S. District Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer. No verdicts or settlements have been reached yet, but with discovery nearing its end, the first bellwether trials are anticipated to start in early 2024. Ongoing discussions are centered around jury selection and trial procedures for these cases Baby Formula NEC Recall List\n\n1. Walmart Recalls 23,000 Containers of Toxic Baby Formula Over Metal Contamination\n\nAccording to an FDA recall letter issued on Saturday, Perrigo Company is recalling over 23,000 containers of toxic baby formula over concerns the products may contain tiny pieces of metal [1].\n\nAffected products were sold exclusively at Walmart stores, and include 23,388 35 oz. containers of Parent\u2019s Choice Advantage NEC Infant Formula Milk-Based Powder with Iron, FDA said.\n\nThe recalled toxic baby formula NEC has a Lot Code of C26EVFV and a \u201cuse by\u201d date of February 26, 2021, on the bottom of the package.\n\nTo date, the FDA is not aware of any injuries or other adverse events associated with the recalled toxic baby formula NEC, and the problem was discovered following a consumer complaint to the FDA\u2019s MAUDE reporting system.\n\nRelated Article: Baby Food Toxic Metals Lawsuit & Attorneys\n\n2. Solgar Recall\n\nAs claimed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three lots of the probiotic ABC Dophilus were recalled in Nov. 2014 when a premature baby died after being given the supplement in a hospital [2].\n\nAccording to a 2021 research by Britannica, the agency determined that the affected product contained Rhizopus oryzae [3], a fungus that can cause a severe infection of the sinus, lungs, intestines, and skin called mucormycosis [4].\n\nFDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Baby Formulas Produced by Abbott Nutrition\n\nThe FDA is investigating consumer complaints of Cronobacter Sakazakii and Salmonella Newport infections linked to powdered NEC infant formula produced at Abbott Nutrition\u2019s facility in Sturgis, Michigan. The agency is advising consumers not to use Similac and Enfamil if:\n\nthe first two digits of the code are 22 through 37; and\n\nthe code on the container contains K8, SH or Z2; and\n\nthe expiration date is 4-1-2022 (APR 2022) or later.\n\nThe FDA is investigating complaints of four infant illnesses from three states, the agency said. All four cases related to these complaints were hospitalized and Cronobacter may have contributed to a death in one case.\n\nThe illnesses occurred in Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas.\n\nCronobacter bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections (sepsis) or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine).\n\nSymptoms of sepsis and meningitis may include poor feeding, irritability, temperature changes, jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes), grunting breaths, and abnormal movements. Cronobacter infection may also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body.\n\nBaby Dies from Infection Linked to ABC Dophilus\n\nOn Nov. 17, 2014, the FDA announced a nationwide recall for 3 lots of ABC Dophilus Powder after it was found to contain Rhizopus oryzae.\n\nABC Dophilus was used as part of the in-hospital treatment course for a preterm infant who died after being given the product. The baby suffered from multiple complications, including intestinal mucormycosis, and died on Oct. 11, 2014.\n\nCDC investigators later found Rhizopus oryzae fungus in containers of ABC Dophilus with the same lot number as the product given to the deceased infant.\n\nWhich Products Were Recalled?\n\nProduct Recalled : Solgar ABC Dophilus\u00ae Powder NET Wt. 1.75 oz (50 g)\n\n: Solgar ABC Dophilus\u00ae Powder NET Wt. 1.75 oz (50 g) UPC Code : 0 33984 00010 0\n\n: 0 33984 00010 0 Label : Solgar\n\n: Solgar Lot Numbers : Lot# 074024-01R1, 074024-01, 074024-02\n\n: Lot# 074024-01R1, 074024-01, 074024-02 Expiration Date: 7/31/15\n\nABC Dophilus products affected by this recall were distributed to Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Maine, Montana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Nebraska, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Utah, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Washington.\n\nWhat is ABC Dophilus Powder?\n\nABC Dophilus Powder is a probiotic blend of bacteria specially formulated to maintain digestive health in children and infants. The supplement can be purchased over the counter for use at home and is also used in some hospitals.\n\nMedical studies have found that probiotics may prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammation, and necrosis (death of tissue) of the bowel. ABC Dophilus Powder is manufactured by Solgar Inc. of Leonia, New Jersey.\n\nRhizopus oryzae\n\nRhizopus oryzae is a common fungus found in decaying organic matter like leaves and rotting wood. An outbreak of mucormycosis of the skin caused by rhizopus oryzae occurred during the cleanup of the Joplin, Missouri tornado in 2011.\n\nAccording to a Solgar spokesperson, because the fungus is so ubiquitous, \u201cthe exact source of where this mold came from is extremely difficult to determine.\u201d ABC Dophilus is made for Solgar by a contract manufacturer, but the company declined to name its supplier.\n\n3. SimplyThick Recall\n\nAs claimed by NPR Organization, the FDA warns parents and nursing staff not to feed babies SimplyThick [5], a product used to help babies with swallowing difficulties because it had been linked to a life-threatening skin disorder known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is characterized by severe blistering and peeling of the skin.\n\nThe agency was aware of at least 15 cases of baby formula NEC \u2014 including 2 infant deaths \u2014 linked to SimplyThick.\n\nSimplyThick is added to breast milk and formula to help keep food down without spitting up, and may also be used in older children and adults with swallowing problems caused by throat trauma.\n\nAccording to the FDA, reports of negative side effects associated with SimplyThick mixed with breast milk first surfaced on May 13, 2011, with 2 reports to the FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting system [6]. Nationwide, at least 4 different medical centers reported toxic epidermal necrolysis in infants during the first half of 2011.\n\n4. Similac Baby Formula NEC Recall\n\nAbbott Laboratories recalled its Similac formula after the FDA said the product could cause internal discomfort and could lead infants to refuse to eat. Affected products included powdered formula (not liquid Similac), and were sold in either plastic containers or in specific-size cans including 8-ounce, 12.4-ounce, and 12.9-ounce cans.\n\nSimilac and Enfamil have also recently been linked to an increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\n5. Enfamil Baby Formula NEC\n\nEnfamil, another cow\u2019s milk-based baby formula like Similac, has recently been linked to necrotizing enterocolitis. Premature infants who are fed Enfamil may develop a perforation (hole) in their intestines.\n\nDangerous bacteria can leak into the abdomen or bloodstream through the hole. Children develop NEC within 2 to 6 weeks after birth.\n\nNovember 2023: Justice Pallmeyer has signed an order stating that Mead Johnson\u2019s motions to dismiss are entered and continued for briefing. The plaintiffs\u2019 responses should be filed before the end of the first week of 2024.\n\nJustice Pallmeyer has signed an order stating that Mead Johnson\u2019s motions to dismiss are entered and continued for briefing.

Both sides present the science of necrotizing enterocolitis and its link to cow\u2019s milk-based baby formula before the court. August 2022: The JPML consolidated approximately 100 lawsuits over NEC claims against Mead Johnson in Illinois MDL 3026.\n\nSimilac and Enfamil Studies\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, the 1st study identifying a potential link between cow\u2019s milk-based baby formulas and necrotizing enterocolitis was first published in the Lancet [7] in 1990, which found that formula-fed babies were 20x more likely to develop NEC compared to children who were nourished with breast milk.\n\nJournal of Pediatrics Study\n\nA decade after the Lancet study came out, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that babies fed with breast milk or human milk fortifiers were 90% less likely to develop NEC compared to those fed with formula products. In 2013, a pair of additional studies were published which reached even more definitive results about the association between NEC and cow formulas.\n\nNew NEC British Medicine Study\n\nA study published in October 2021 by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) [8] suggested that the makers of Similac and Enfamil infant formulas have funded biased and unreliable clinical product trials. The study\u2019s authors determined that the infant formula trials showed a \u201cuniversal lack of transparency\u201d and may have downplayed the risks of NEC linked to their cow-milk formula products.\n\nMore NEC Formula Studies\n\nA study titled Evidence-Based Feeding Strategies Before and After the Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis, which was published in Expert Review of Clinical Immunology in July 2014), stated that \u201cNecrotizing enterocolitis (N.E.C.) is a devastating disease of premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. It is well established that the risk is increased by the administration of infant formula.\u201d This should be a key study in any successful NEC baby formula lawsuit.\n\nIn 2016, another round of clinical study results were published in Seminars in Perinatology titled Beyond Necrotizing Enterocolitis Prevention \u2013 Breastfeeding Medicine and Human Milk is the Feeding Strategy to Prevent Necrotizing Enterocolitis. The authors concluded that \u201cExtremely premature infants who received an exclusive HUM [Human Milk] diet had a significantly lower incidence of NEC and mortality. The HUM group also had a reduction in late-onset sepsis, BPD, and ROP. This multicenter study further emphasizes the many benefits of an exclusive HUM diet, and demonstrates multiple improved outcomes after implementation of such a feeding protocol.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the independent healthcare research group Cochrane published the results of the most comprehensive study to date comparing health results for premature babies fed with cow\u2019s milk-based formula versus human milk. The findings put to rest any lingering confusion about the existence of a causal relationship between cow-milk-based formulas and NEC in premature infants.\n\nShould You Feed Your Child Baby Formula?\n\nFDA classifies baby formula as a food, not a drug. The products are designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water).\n\nAccording to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) [9], infant formula is \u201ca food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants because it simulates human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk.\u201d It applies to cow\u2019s milk-based formula and other derivatives.\n\nDespite conflicting clinical trials and lack of FDA approval, probiotic supplements like ABC Dophilus have been increasingly used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease of premature infants where the intestinal wall becomes inflamed and bacteria invade the bowel wall.\n\nWhat is Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC)?\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis is a rare but extremely serious medical condition seen almost exclusively in premature infants that is characterized by necrosis (tissue death) in the bowels. The inner lining of the intestines contains millions of normally harmless bacteria called the \u2018normal flora\u2019 that are part of the digestive process. In NEC, however, the bacteria begin to attack the intestinal wall.\n\nEventually, a hole can form through the bowel wall (a perforation), spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity. Bowel perforation is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery and has a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough it affects only 1 in 2,000 to 4,000 births, or between 1% and 5% of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, NEC is the most common and serious gastrointestinal disorder among hospitalized preterm infants.\n\nSymptoms of Necrotizing Enterocolitis\n\nfeeding intolerance\n\nincreased gastric residuals\n\nabdominal distention\n\nbloody stools\n\nbloated stomach\n\ngreenish-tinged vomiting\n\nAccording to research by Courtesy Johns Hopkins Medical [10].\n\nAbbott Faces New NEC Lawsuits Over Baby Formula\u2019s Risk of Deadly Illness\n\nAbbott Nutrition faces an increasing number of NEC infant formula lawsuit cases after recalling its powdered infant formula, which was linked to the hospitalization of three babies and at least one death.\n\nAll four babies had become sick from Cronobacter Sakazakii or salmonella infections after ingesting cow\u2019s milk-based Abbott\u2019s Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare brands of infant formula. Abbott recalled certain products lots of these brands on February 17, 2022.\n\nLess than a month after the recall, the parents of a hospitalized baby in Texas filed a pre-suit petition against Abbott in Kaufman County District Court. According to the infant formula NEC lawsuit, the baby developed diarrhea so severe that the parents took him to the hospital, where he stayed for several weeks. Tests confirmed the child had a Cronobacter Sakazakii infection.\n\nAnother baby died on February 28, with a Cronobacter infection noted by doctors as a \u201ccontributing cause of death.\u201d Abbott then expanded its recall to include another lot of its cow\u2019s milk-based Similac infant formula due to the ensuing NEC baby formula lawsuits.\n\nCan I File a Class Action?\n\nAlthough Schmidt & Clark, LLP, is a nationally recognized class action firm, we have decided against this type of litigation when it comes to cow\u2019s milk-based NEC baby formula lawsuits.\n\nOur NEC baby formula lawyers feel that if there is a successful resolution to these cases, individual NEC baby formula lawsuits, not class actions will be the best way to get maximum payouts to our clients from baby formula manufacturers.\n\nSuppose your child or other loved one has been harmed by the side effects of a baby formula product.

Recent data from a 2024 clinical audit suggests that continuous glucose monitor and strip along with insulin pens lead in popularity, with 52% of newly prescribed insulin therapies leveraging pen-based delivery systems. Meanwhile, insulin pumps, though traditionally limited to advanced centers, are growing in acceptance, with a notable 23% rise in prescriptions among type 1 patients over the last 12 months. CGMs are increasingly favored, as 29% of individuals living with diabetes now rely on sensor-based glucose readings for real-time insights. Additionally, SMBG meters remain a foundational tool, as 81% of diabetes patients continue using these meters at least twice daily.\n\nAmong younger adults under 40, 42% survey individuals in the diabetes devices market reported preferring wearable technologies for glucose control, indicating a lean toward CGM patches equipped with smartphone connectivity. A 2023 survey noted that 35% of Argentinian pharmacists observed a growing demand for sensor-enabled devices, underlining an evolving consumer shift. Insulin patch pumps, though still relatively niche, saw a 14% increase in availability in private hospitals across the country. Across both urban and semi-urban clinics, 68% of endocrinologists now advocate a combined approach\u2014using SMBG meters for baseline readings alongside periodic CGM usage. Furthermore, 27% of public health programs in 2024 introduced educational initiatives on selecting appropriate insulin delivery systems. Finally, 53% of diabetes specialists emphasize the multi-device approach, noting that diversified options drive better glycemic management and reduce hospital revisits.\n\nDemographic Analysis: Diverse Age, Gender, Income Impact Device Usage Patterns in Argentina Diabetes Devices Market\n\nArgentina\u2019s demography plays a decisive role in shaping diabetes device market growth and adoption. Currently, adults are the largest consumers of the these devices. In 2023, a study from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses indicated that 33% of individuals aged 60 and above with diabetes in urban centers rely on CGMs, whereas only 18% within the same age bracket in rural areas use similar technology. Among low-income communities, 48% of respondents cited cost as the major barrier to insulin pump adoption, while 59% in higher-income brackets felt confident about covering out-of-pocket device expenses. Furthermore, 21% of women under 35 with gestational diabetes reported significant reliance on smartphone-compatible glucometers for daily monitoring.

In 2024, government-led programs in five provinces of the Argentina diabetes devices market introduced subsidized test strips for individuals over 55, benefiting nearly 25% of lower-income diabetes patients in those regions. Overall, 63% of younger adults aged 20\u201329 reported confidence in using app-linked devices, underscoring strong digital literacy. Another key insight shows that 29% of high-income families in metropolitan areas combined multiple devices\u2014like insulin pens and sensor patches\u2014to tackle varied glycemic patterns. Finally, 36% of rural diabetes support groups collaborated with telemedicine platforms to empower local patients, reflecting an inclusive push toward broader device availability.\n\nDiabetes Type Dominance: Differentiating Preferences In Type 1 And Type 2\n\nDistinct device preferences exist between individuals managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Argentina diabetes devices market. As of 2023, 71% of newly diagnosed type 1 patients reported using insulin pumps within the first nine months of diagnosis, a trend attributed to specialists\u2019 recommendations for stable glycemic control. Meanwhile, 58% of type 2 patients primarily depended on insulin pens, reflecting a preference for cost-effective and straightforward injection methods. According to one nationwide survey, 49% of type 1 patients found CGMs essential for reducing severe hypoglycemia episodes, while only 27% of type 2 respondents saw continuous monitoring as indispensable. Another important development: 35% of type 1 adolescents engaged in advanced sensor-augmented pump therapy, highlighting a growing appetite for integrated insulin delivery platforms.\n\nInterestingly, public health clinics observed that 62% of type 1 individuals were open to technology upgrades every two years, contrasting with only 38% of type 2 users who shared the same willingness. In 2024, 44% of type 2 patients with complications (such as neuropathy) considered switching from pens to pumps upon their physicians\u2019 advice, showing a trend in the diabetes devices market. Research institutions in Mendoza found that 56% of type 1 participants experienced fewer diabetic ketoacidosis events with CGM-assisted therapy, whereas 19% of type 2 subjects noted better overall medication compliance after adopting simplified SMBG meters. Across multiple socioeconomic segments, 33% of type 1 patients integrated smartphone analytics with pump usage, a practice only 12% of type 2 patients embraced. This contrast underscores the divergent paths both groups take in optimizing device-based interventions.\n\nTransformative Partnerships, Research, and Key Regulatory Pathways Shaping Future Market Directions\n\nIndustry collaboration and research breakthroughs form the backbone of Argentina\u2019s diabetes devices market evolution. In 2023, seven university-led clinical trials focused on artificial pancreas systems, with 37% showing promising results in reducing nocturnal hypoglycemia.

            "content": "Everyone wants to get rich with technology growth stocks. While others play checkers, consider playing chess with this dividend ETF.\n\nVirtually every investor wants to build wealth, but there are countless roads to this destination. When discussing potential millionaire-making investments, it often boils down to how likely they are to get you where you want to go and how long it will take.\n\nNaturally, individual stocks usually represent the home-run investment. On the other hand, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are generally about the underlying strategy because they represent many stocks (sometimes hundreds) lumped together and traded under one ticker symbol.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD -0.39%) is a popular dividend stock ETF. However, investors frequently debate whether it has enough growth and upside for wealth-seeking long-term investors. I investigated the ETF's long-term potential and the best way for investors to maximize it.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nHere is what investing in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF gets you\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF includes 103 dividend stocks, so buying a share of the ETF gives investors a sliver of ownership in over a hundred companies. Therefore, investors are highly diversified out of the gate. The fund follows the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index.\n\nAt the current share price, investors receive a 3.3% distribution (dividend) yield, far exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3%.\n\nNow, let's talk strategy. The ETF features mature, blue chip companies with a track record of paying and increasing dividends. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's top 10 positions are:\n\nPfizer : 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases\n\n: 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases BlackRock : 15 years\n\n: 15 years AbbVie : 52 years (including as part of Abbott Labs )\n\n: 52 years (including as part of ) Cisco Systems : 14 years\n\n: 14 years Coca-Cola : 62 years\n\n: 62 years Bristol Myers Squibb : 18 years\n\n: 18 years Texas Instruments : 21 years\n\n: 21 years PepsiCo : 52 years\n\n: 52 years Lockheed Martin : 22 years\n\n: 22 years Amgen: 13 years\n\nPeople focus on dividends as earnings a company could have retained and reinvested but instead gave to shareholders. That's technically true, and it's also true these mature companies aren't among the market's fastest growers.\n\nHowever, dividends also represent a litmus test. Only a high-quality and growing company can pay a dividend (a cash expense for the business) and raise it yearly. Building substantial stock market wealth requires time in most cases, and high-quality dividend stocks offer consistency for what they lack in growth.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has generated nearly 400% in total returns since late 2011. That makes the ETF a multibagger. This blue chip dividend stock strategy can enrich investors when you give it sufficient time for compounding to work its magic.\n\nThe ETF has lagged the S&P 500, but there's more to the story\n\nIn my experience, the most common argument against the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is that it lags the S&P 500, so people would be better off simply buying and holding an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nI'll never dismiss investing in the S&P 500, but it's not as strong an argument as it seems. If you look at the historical performance of the two below, you can see they were pretty close until the past five years:\n\nThe S&P 500 has become increasingly technology-weighted (33%) due to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, which currently represent 32% of its value. In other words, the S&P 500 isn't as diversified as its name implies. One could argue that a downturn in the technology sector would hurt the S&P 500 more than the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, which only has 8.8% exposure to technology.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Don't let recency bias and a technology stock boom prevent you from appreciating how effectively the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has generated wealth for investors over the past 14 years.\n\nHow to get the most out of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nWant to invest in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF? Reinvest your dividends.\n\nThe companies in the ETF are generally growing, but they aren't growth stocks. Reinvesting the dividends means your dividends buy more ETF shares, which also pay dividends. It's an additional layer of compounding that helps supercharge your investment returns.\n\nYou're also building a dividend snowball that pays you more income as it grows. The cool part is that you can eventually keep your dividends instead of reinvesting them, meaning you're getting cash flow from your investment without selling shares. Theoretically, your portfolio could pay you forever, whereas someone who must sell their stocks for cash could run into trouble if they sell too much or the market crashes.\n\nAfter all, becoming a millionaire isn't just about labels -- it's about lifetime wealth.",

            "content": "The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, mistakenly offered his condolences to Jimmy Carter\u2019s dead wife shortly after the Democratic former president died on Sunday.\n\nAbbott\u2019s statement sent \u201cprayers and deepest condolences\u201d to former first lady Rosalynn Carter and the rest of her family shortly after her husband\u2019s death at the age of 100, as the Dallas news station WFAA reported. But Rosalynn Carter had died more than a year earlier \u2013 on 19 November 2023, at age 96.\n\nThe Democratic party of Collins county, Texas, seized on the blunder and wrote on X: \u201cDid anyone in the governor\u2019s office proof the condolence note?\u201d\n\nAnother social media user wrote, \u201cCondolences to Rosalynn Carter? She passed in Nov of 2023. WTF is wrong with you?\u201d\n\nA couple of hours passed before Abbott\u2019s office distributed an amended statement about Jimmy Carter\u2019s death that removed the reference to his late wife of 77 years, as the Houston Press noted.\n\nThe revised statement read: \u201cCecilia and I send our prayers and deepest condolences to the entire family.\u201d\n\nBoth versions of Abbott\u2019s statement were otherwise effusive about Jimmy Carter, who was US president from 1977 to 1981 and won the 2002 Nobel peace prize for his work seeking peaceful resolutions to global conflicts, advancing human rights and democracy, and promoting economic and social development.\n\n\u201cOur nation remains the greatest beacon of freedom and opportunity in the world because of our fearless chief executives who are our guiding force through the best and worst of times,\u201d Abbott\u2019s statement said in part as politicos around the world reacted to Carter\u2019s death. \u201cFor that, we owe President Carter our enduring gratitude \u2026 and he will be greatly missed by many.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s gaffe on Sunday called to mind another episode that earned him unflattering news headlines. In the summer of 2023, as US conservatives denounced Bud Light for hiring the trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney to promote its brand, Abbott shared a fake news article from a satirical website which claimed the country singer Garth Brooks had been jeered off stage by American \u201cpatriots\u201d over his support of the beer.\n\n\u201cGo woke. Go Broke,\u201d Abbott wrote on one of his social media accounts with respect to the fake article \u2013 which was published after Republicans became angry at Brooks for announcing that his bar in Nashville would serve Bud Light as well as asking his patrons to be tolerant.\n\nSeveral fellow social media users pointed out that the article Abbott was passing along as if it were genuine news was from the Dunning-Kruger-Times satirical website. A disclaimer on the website discloses that its content is \u201cparody, satire and tomfoolery\u201d.\n\nThe governor quickly deleted his post having fun at Brooks\u2019s expense. Yet he did not do so in time to avoid social media users taking screenshots of his error and mocking him for it.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that, I was besides myself with joy,\u201d Christopher Blair later told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the dumbest people in the country.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, Brooks and fellow country singer Trisha Yearwood \u2013 his wife \u2013 helped lead the 2024 Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project with Habitat for Humanity, which resulted in 30 new homes being built in St Paul, Minnesota, as part of an affordable housing initiative there.\n\nAbbott has been Texas\u2019s governor since 2015, pursuing an agenda that exalts the gun industry, opposes immigration and seeks to infuse public education with Christianity.",

            "content": "It was all about the storms this year. They were the big news surrounding the insurance industry, with several named storms hitting in a severe and costly Atlantic hurricane season, and a few massive natural catastrophes abroad driving up losses and wreaking havoc globally.\n\nClaims Journal put together a list of our most popular stories for the year. While domestic and international storms dominated the news, big lawsuits with high stakes also were among the most read articles on the news site, including a suits involving the worlds\u2019 best known burger chain and a dust up over a popular TV game show.\n\nFollowing are Claims Journal\u2019s most popular articles for 2024.\n\nStorms drove losses, and Claims Journal readers are\u2014naturally\u2014driven to consume news about losses and claims.\n\nThe third quarter of 2024 saw a number of significant disaster events, which drove year-to date economic losses above at least $258 billion and insured losses of $102 billion, according to Aon plc in its Q3 Global Catastrophe Recap \u2013 October 2024 report, which aggregates and analyzes global natural catastrophe data.\n\nThe report reveals that there were at least 280 notable global natural disaster events in the Q1-Q3 period. Losses from Hurricane Milton and additional events expected in the rest of the calendar year, however, will likely push total annual insured losses above those seen in 2023 ($125 billion), Aon said.\n\nEconomic losses for the first nine months were significantly lower than losses during the same period in 2023 ($351 billion).\n\nThird-quarter insured losses were driven by three costly Atlantic hurricanes (Helene, Beryl and Debby), severe convective storm (SCS) outbreaks in the United States and Canada, as well as flooding in Central Europe.\n\nAlmost two weeks after Hurricane Milton made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, as a Category 3 storm, claims and loss totals continued to rise. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation said carriers had reported more than 221,582 claims and an estimated insured loss total of more than $2.7 billion.\n\nThose numbers kept rising. Flooding from Milton appears to have been more extensive than initially determined, affecting nearly 185,000 buildings all across Florida, says a new analysis from ICEYE, a firm that uses satellite images to measure damage for the insurance industry.\n\nCoreLogic earlier had reported that insured wind and flood losses from Milton would be between $17 billion to $28 billion, and that property restoration would be a difficult process.\n\nOfficials in two Southeastern states took steps to hold insurers or recipients of insurance funds accountable after Hurricanes Helene and Milton spurred thousands of insurance claims.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance reminded insurance carriers that they must soon report information about claims stemming from Hurricane Helene, which brought severe flooding to the eastern part of the state. Insurers should report the data through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, in six monthly reports starting Nov. 5.\n\nThe data call applies to all property/casualty insurers in the state, including surplus lines carriers and those that write excess flood coverage. The spreadsheet information should be submitted through the NAIC data collection portal, Insurance Commissioner Carter Lawrence said in his Oct. 17 bulletin.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, a state-created layer of reinsurance, expects to pay out about $4.6 billion to help cover insurers\u2019 losses in Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But that won\u2019t trigger a surcharge on premiums.\n\nAnd a number of Florida property insurers will take a hit from the recent storms, but that, too, will be manageable.\n\nThat\u2019s the word from the Cat Fund\u2019s advisory council and from KBRA, the ratings firm previously known as Kroll Bond Rating Agency, which rates about 13 Florida-based carriers.\n\n\u201cWhile two major hurricanes hit Floridian shores within a two-week period, preliminary gross and net loss estimates for homeowners\u2019 carriers indicate that full-year \u2026 earnings will be significantly reduced but are expected to remain positive, with no appreciable erosion in capital and continued near-term ratings stability,\u201d KBRA said in a report.\n\nIt was stormy all over the globe this year.\n\nBarcelona\u2019s transport system had ground to a halt, as Catalonia was the latest Spanish region to be hit by extreme storms that killed more than 200 people in neighboring Valencia.\n\nFlooded streets brought traffic to a standstill in the capital of Catalonia, while local train services were suspended for a day. Flights were also redirected from Barcelona\u2019s airport, with parts of Catalonia under a red alert for torrential rains. Schools suspended classes in nine cities in the south of the region.\n\nThe floods that devastated the Spanish region are expected to trigger total insurance losses in excess of \u20ac3.5 billion ($3.8 billion), Moody\u2019s estimates.\n\nAnother popular story reported on Taiwan suspending trading on its $2.5 trillion stock exchange as powerful typhoon Kong-rey barreled toward the archipelago.\n\nThe storm first hit Taiwan and Philippines before affecting East China, South Korea and Japan in late October. Kong-rey was strongest storm to hit the region in three decades.\n\nTrami and Kong-rey in October were especially destructive, causing more than 7 billion pesos ($119 million) in crop losses, according to government data \u2014 more than the total combined agricultural damages caused by storms in the first nine months of the year.\n\nSuccessive storms hitting the Philippines this late in the season is \u201cquite rare, but not impossible,\u201d said Gerry Bagtasa, a professor at the University of the Philippines\u2019 Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology. It\u2019s a characteristic of La Ni\u00f1a, with a similar event occurring in 2020.\n\nLawsuits were also among the most read articles on the site this year. And any articles that also involved social media platforms really drove up readership.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. failed in a bid to challenge a class action suit in the U.K. that alleged Facebook abused its dominant position and exploited its users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Court of Appeal refused to permit Meta and Facebook\u2019s UK unit to challenge a competition appeals court which had greenlit a revised version of the lawsuit. The court rejected Meta\u2019s appeal at a hearing on October 7, but only published the detailed ruling on Friday.\n\nThe case at a London competition tribunal was filed on behalf of 44 million British Facebook users, who alleged the social network only gave access to its platform in exchange for user data that generated billions in revenue, according to competition expert Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, who brought the collective claim.\n\nAbbott Laboratories and a unit of Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc were cleared by a jury over claims they hid risks their premature-infant formulas can cause a bowel disease that severely sickened a baby boy. It was the companies\u2019 first trial win in litigation over the products.\n\nJurors in state court in St. Louis reached the verdict at the end of October, ending the latest trial of more than 1,000 lawsuits alleging the formulas can cause necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, a bowel ailment that has been linked to deaths and brain damage. Other juries earlier this year held the companies liable in separate trials, including a nearly $500 million verdict against Abbott in July in the same St. Louis courthouse.\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than a day before rejecting claims that formulas made by Abbott and Reckitt\u2019s Mead Johnson caused NEC in Elizabeth Whitfield\u2019s son.\n\nSony Pictures Television Inc. accused CBS Studios Inc. in a lawsuit of leaving millions of dollars on the table in the network\u2019s distribution of the popular Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune game shows.\n\nSony, the producer of the programs, claims CBS has made more than $1 billion profit from a distribution agreement going back 35 years, but isn\u2019t working aggressively enough to maximize revenue from licensing the shows to local TV stations and selling advertising in them.\n\nFor years, CBS projected flat to 2% growth in licensing revenues year-over-year, leading Sony to become \u201cskeptical of and concerned about those projections,\u201d according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Sony said the first year it got involved in negotiations for some ABC stations, licensing fees grew 17%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s was sued by consumers in a proposed class action stemming from the E.coli outbreak linked to onions in the fast-food chain\u2019s Quarter Pounders.\n\nAmanda McCray of Chicago and William Michael Kraft of Davie, Florida, said they experienced many symptoms associated with E.coli infection after buying Quarter Pounders this month.\n\nBoth said they would not have bought their burgers had McDonald\u2019s disclosed the risk of contamination, and have suffered damages because of McDonald\u2019s actions.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court seeks unspecified damages, but exceeding $5 million, for all people in the United States who bought Quarter Pounders contaminated with E.coli.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s halted Quarter Pounder sales in October in one-fifth of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants after an outbreak that killed at least one person and sickened 75 people.",

AI can be used to screen a large number of spontaneous preterm births based on clinical and ultrasonographic variables. AI and machine learning (ML) techniques including artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks can aid in the early diagnosis of spontaneous preterm labor and birth. AI and ML result in improved efficiency and enhanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. AI can also predict the outcomes of preterm birth and histologic chorioamnionitis in PROM. Additionally, AI and ML can aid in the effective diagnosis of imaging tests during pregnancy, enabling healthcare professionals to make timely decisions and reduce manual errors. However, the integration of AI and ML is still in its infancy requiring more research and generation of data.\n\nU.S. Preterm Birth and PROM Testing Market Size and Growth 2025 to 2034\n\nThe U.S. preterm birth and PROM testing market size was evaluated at USD 423.15 million in 2024 and is predicted to be worth around USD 960.74 million by 2034, rising at a CAGR of 8.62% from 2025 to 2034.\n\nNorth America dominated the preterm birth and PROM market and accounted for the largest revenue share of 39% in 2024. This is attributed to the growing cases of preterm birth rate in U.S. It is reported that more than 370,000 babies were born prematurely in the U.S. in 2023. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the early preterm rate was 2.76% and the late preterm rate was 7.65% in 2023 Around 17% of the preterm babies die due to low birth weight. The higher adoption of advanced technologies in the preterm birth and PROM testing has fueled the growth of the market in this region.The favorable reimbursement policies by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also propels market growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Asia Pacific is expected to be the most opportunistic market throughout the forecast period. According to the WHO, over 60% of the preterm birth cases occur in Africa and South Asia. The poor families in this developing region suffer the most. However, the growing awareness regarding the availability of PROM tests is positively impacting the market growth in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nMarket Overview\n\nPreterm birth includes when a baby is born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a rupture of the amniotic sac before labor begins. When the PROM occurs before 37 weeks of gestation, the term preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is used. PROM occurs in about 8-10% of all pregnancies. At the same time, PPROM causes in around one-fourth to one-third of all preterm births. PROM can be diagnosed in many ways, including physical examination, microscopic analysis, vaginal fluid pH testing, diagnostic tests for amniotic fluid proteins, and dye test. Additional diagnostic tests may include obstetric ultrasound, urinalysis, and blood tests.\n\nPreterm Birth and PROM Testing Market Growth Factors\n\nGrowing Cases of Preterm Birth: The growing cases of preterm birth occurring spontaneously or due to medical complications require PROM testing.\n\nIncreasing Number of Diagnostic Labs: The rising incidences of PROM and other complications necessitate the development of diagnostic labs.\n\nLatest Innovations in Diagnostic Techniques: The growing research and development activities facilitate the latest innovations in diagnostic techniques.\n\nTechnological Advancements: The advent of advanced technologies, such as AI and ML, aid in effective testing of PROM.\n\nFavorable Government Policies: Several government organizations release guidelines and initiatives to increase awareness about preterm birth and PROM testing.\n\nMarket Scope\n\nReport Highlights Details Market Size in 2024 USD 1.55 Billion Market Size in 2025 USD 1.68 Billion Market Size by 2034 USD 3.45 Billion Growth Rate From 2025 to 2034 CAGR of 8.34% Base Year 2024 Forecast Period 2025 to 2034 Segments Covered Test Type, End User Regional Scope North America, APAC, Europe, Latin America, MEAN, Rest of the World\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nDriver\n\nFavorable Government Policies\n\nThe increasing incidences of preterm births and PROM globally facilitate several government organizations to impose strict guidelines for early detection and screening of preterm births and PROM. The World Health Organization also makes efforts to increase the effectiveness of screening programs globally. The UK government has recently launched initiatives to ensure that all women have access to information and advice on pregnancy planning and preconception health. Government organizations provide funding for developing novel and innovative diagnostics for PROM. Additionally, they are on the verge of increasing awareness about PROM testing. Government-led insurance companies also offer favorable reimbursement policies to support patient\u2019s healthcare expenses.\n\nRestraint\n\nHigh Cost and Lack of Skilled Professionals\n\nThe major challenge of the preterm birth and PROM testing market is the high cost of PROM testing. The high cost of advanced PROM testing limits the affordability of several patients in low- and middle-income countries. Another major challenge is the lack of skilled professionals. The lack of skilled professionals, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries, restricts the market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nPoint-of-Care Diagnostics\n\nThe growing demand for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics presents future preterm birth and PROM testing market growth opportunities. POC diagnostics are methods to test a medical condition at or near the patient. Several researchers are developing POC diagnostics for testing PROM. The ActimPROM test is the first FDA-approved reliable bedside test developed by Abbott Laboratories for quickly and easily detecting premature rupture of fetal membranes (PROM) in all patients. The demand for POC diagnostics increases due to improved patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. They also save time for patients and help clinicians in effective decision-making. Thus, POC diagnostics have the potential to transform the healthcare sector by providing a path to increased access, cost, and treatment quality.\n\nTest Type Insights\n\nThe ultrasound dominated the market with largest share in terms of revenue of the total market.\n\nUltrasound is the most common type of test conducted by the doctors to observe developing fetus.
