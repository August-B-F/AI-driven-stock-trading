            "content": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enigma Biomedical USA, Inc. (EB USA) today announced that it has selected two (2) four-repeat tau (4R Tau) protein PET imaging biomarkers to advance into Phase 1 (Ph1) studies. Previously, EB USA executed an Exclusive License and Option Agreement (License) with AbbVie for the development and potential commercialization of AbbVie\u2019s next-generation F18 PET imaging biomarkers to assess the presence of 4R Tau in subjects with suspected neurodegenerative disease. These imaging biomarkers hold great promise as important new tools in advancing understanding of a range of neurodegenerative diseases in which the misfolded 4R Tau protein is implicated, including the tauopathies Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreclinical evaluations successfully identified two candidates to advance to Ph1 studies. These studies will examine several parameters, including safety, dosimetry, biomarker dynamic uptake and washout as well as determination of the optimal time for imaging. The studies are projected to commence in 3Q25.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that we have progressed this program to the clinical stage,\u201d said Rick Hiatt, President and CEO of EB USA. \u201cEB USA is committed to enabling the acceleration of promising technologies to advance the fight against debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. In this, we will build on demonstrated successes with the best-in-class neuroimaging biomarkers MK-6240 (Cerveau Technologies, sold to Lantheus Medical Imaging in 2023) and NAV-4694 (in development by Meilleur Technologies Inc., sold to Lantheus in 2024.) We believe our 4R Tau PET imaging biomarkers from AbbVie have unique properties and will prove useful in developing therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative disease. Our goal is to expand the availability of this novel investigational imaging technology to the broader scientific community.\u201d\n\nHartmuth Kolb, Ph.D., Chief Science Officer of EB USA, states: \u201cEB USA is excited to take the next steps in this important development process. The Ph1 studies are designed to measure an array of candidate characteristics in addition to safety and dosimetry, including metabolite formation and the dynamics of tracer uptake, retention and clearance. A final candidate for future development will be chosen based on increased uptake in PSP patients relative to that of healthy controls, the extent of off-target and non-specific binding as well as dynamic range, sensitivity and kinetics. We look forward to the first administration of these candidate biomarkers later this year.\u201d\n\nAbout Enigma Biomedical USA, Inc.\n\nEnigma Biomedical USA, Inc.\u2019s vision is to be the premier provider of imaging biomarkers for neurological pathologies, associated information technology, and related tools to accelerate the development, approval, and adoption of effective therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. EB USA\u2019s neuroimaging biomarkers provide Pharma and Academic researchers with best-in-class tools for enabling Disease-Modifying Therapy development with the highest possible precision and accuracy.\n\nContacts\n\n\n\nEnigma Biomedical USA, Inc.\n\nRick Hiatt, 617-906-2715",

NCX 470, Nicox's lead clinical candidate, is an innovative NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop currently in Phase 3 development for treating open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.In February 2025, Qlaris Bio, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on addressing unmet needs in severe ophthalmic conditions, has reported positive topline results from two U.S. Phase II trials evaluating QLS-111 in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). The Phase II studies, Osprey and Apteryx, achieved all primary and secondary endpoints successfully.In January 2025, Glaukos Corporation (NYSE: GKOS), a company specializing in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals and medical technologies for glaucoma treatment, has launched a Phase 2b/3 clinical program for iDose TREX, its next-generation sustained-release therapeutic platform. iDose TREX is designed to resemble the original iDose TR in size and shape but offers nearly double the drug capacity.In October 2024, At the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2024 conference in Chicago, Illinois, findings from a Phase II study on the safety of Neurotech Pharmaceuticals' NT-501 encapsulated cell therapy, which secretes ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), were presented. The study focused on neuroprotection in patients with glaucoma. Alexandria M. Dominguez, MS, a research assistant at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, shared the results, which demonstrated that CNTF-secreting implants were well-tolerated by patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, with no severe adverse events reported.In April 2024, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ: OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving vision and quality of life through innovative therapies for conditions such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and other ocular diseases, has announced positive Phase 2 results for PAXTRAVA (travoprost intracameral implant or OTX-TIC) in treating patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.In the 7MM, there were 17,280,267 cases of glaucoma overall in 2022. During the projected period (2023-2032), this number is expected to rise at a significant CAGRIn the 7MM, there were 7,322,693 cases of diagnosed prevalent glaucoma in 2022. During the study period (2019-2032), there is predicted to be a considerable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of these casesWith 2,251,283 cases estimated to be the highest diagnosed prevalence of Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG) in the US in 2022, it is anticipated that this number will rise sharply in the near future as a result of improving diagnostic tests and population growth.With 649,908 cases of Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG), Germany had the most diagnosed prevalent population of any European nation in 2022. France came in second with 631,650 cases. However, out of the 7MM, Spain had the least number of people with a diagnosisThere are numerous medications in the Open Angle Glaucoma pipeline at the moment.

Sheehan, PhD, serves as the chief executive officer & chief scientific officer at SauveBio\n\nThe company will specialize in flow cytometry and offer a range of services to assist scientists across various fields, including immunology, neuroscience, fertility and cancer research.\n\nVOLUNTOWN, CT, March 21, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Hannah C. Sheehan, PhD, has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\n\n\n\nDr. Sheehan is a distinguished scientist and entrepreneur, currently serving as the chief executive officer & chief scientific officer at SauveBio, a company she is set to launch as a full-service flow cytometry contract research organization. The company will specialize in flow cytometry and offer a range of services to assist scientists across various fields, including immunology, neuroscience, fertility and cancer research.\n\n\n\nPrior to establishing SauveBio, Dr. Sheehan was a senior scientist I at AbbVie from 2022-2024. Her work there involved leading innovative research projects and contributing to the development of new scientific methodologies.\n\n\n\nBefore joining AbbVie, Dr. Sheehan was a graduate student researcher at Northeastern University from 2017 to 2022. During this time, she made significant contributions to the field of biology, particularly in mitochondrial research. Her groundbreaking work on mitochondrial subpopulations in aging mammalian ovaries led to her being invited to deliver a keynote lecture at University Hospital Regensburg in Germany.\n\n\n\nLaying the groundwork for Dr. Sheehan's professional accomplishments was her educational background and undergraduate work. While earning dual Bachelor of Science degrees in biological sciences and cell & molecular biology from the University of Rhode Island, she participated in the summer undergraduate research fellowship program in 2016 and gained foundational experience as an undergraduate research assistant from 2015 until 2017. During her studies, she was recognized with the Alpha Award for Research twice, among other accolades. She subsequently earned a Doctor of Philosophy in biology from Northeastern University in 2022.\n\n\n\nReflecting on her journey, Dr. Sheehan attributes much of her success to her father, an entrepreneur who has been a constant source of support and inspiration throughout her career. Her grandmother's strong work ethic and her mother's guidance have also played pivotal roles in shaping her path. Throughout her endeavors, her dedication to research has been evident through her numerous publications, including works on mitochondrial function and stem cell characterization.\n\n\n\nBeyond her professional ventures, Dr. Sheehan has been actively involved in civic organizations and has held leadership positions, such as the president of the University of Rhode Island's chapter of Delta Epsilon Mu between 2014 and 2017. She was also a global health advocate with Partners In Health Engage from 2015 to 2017 and volunteered as a camp counselor at Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake Inc. in 2012.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Dr. Sheehan is enthusiastic about developing SauveBio into a comprehensive service provider that collaborates closely with scientists across various disciplines. Her vision for SauveBio is to operate as an extension of research teams, actively participating in decision-making processes and contributing to scientific publications.\n\n\n\nAbout Marquis Who's Who\u00ae:\n\nSince 1899, when A.

            "content": "Migraine is a disabling condition that not only impairs an individual's quality of life, but also causes societal losses. Therefore, it is important to treat migraine quickly and preventively. Expectations are higher than ever for Aquipta (atogepant), an oral CGRP treatment that is effective in preventing migraine and easy to take.\n\nThis was evident at \u201cAbbVie's Migraine Portfolio: from CM to EM Symposium,\u201d held at the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas on March 6.\n\nAbbVie's Migraine Portfolio: from CM to EM Symposium at the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas on March 6, 2025.\n\nThe symposium, organized by AbbVie Korea to share the latest advances in migraine prophylaxis and foster academic exchange among experts, was attended by more than 100 neurologists both online and offline.\n\nIn her presentation, \u201cInnovations in Migraine Treatment: The Latest Findings on the Disease and Atozepant,\u201d Lee Mi-ji, a professor in the Department of Neurology at Seoul National University Hospital, presented the latest research on the recently revised migraine preventive treatment guidelines and the societal burden of migraine.\n\nLee shared interim results from the CAPTURE study, a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) study of migraine patients presented at the European Headache Society in December. The study showed that as migraine frequency increases, the impact on quality of life, as well as loss of productivity and disability in daily activities, is greater.\n\nIn particular, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Aquipta in preventing migraine showed that the Aquipta 60 mg once-daily treatment group showed rapid improvement in AIM-D (physical activity and performance of functioning) as early as one week of treatment compared to the placebo group. This improvement was sustained for up to two to four weeks.\n\n\u201cMigraine is a serious condition that not only impairs the quality of life of patients, but also causes social losses, and needs to be managed with early treatment before it becomes chronic, as well as ongoing preventive care,\u201d Lee said.\n\nKim Byung-kun, Professor of Neurology at Nowon Eulji Medical Center, presented \u201cManagement of patients with comorbidities due to migraine\u201d and introduced various comorbidities that can occur in migraine patients and their treatment.\n\n\"As the frequency of headaches increases, the prevalence of migraine symptoms, impact and disability due to headaches, and comorbidities tend to increase,\" said Kim. \"In particular, depression, a psychiatric comorbidity, is seen in many migraine patients and is strongly associated with the chronicity of migraine, so it is important to treat depression as soon as possible.\"\n\nMoon Heui-soo, a professor of neurology at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, spoke on \u201cChanging Migraine Treatment Landscape,\u201d highlighting the changes that the launch of Aquipta, an oral CGRP therapy, has brought to the migraine prevention treatment landscape.\n\n\"CGRP-targeted therapies, including Aquipta, are designed to target the pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine, unlike existing migraine preventive drugs, leading to innovative treatment changes.\" \"Among them, Aquipta antagonizes CGRP receptors, showing a difference in mechanism of action from existing CGRP-targeted therapies. The rapid onset of action with no migraine in 87.7% of patients taking Aquipta 60 mg on day 1, the tolerability and safety profile confirmed in the study, and the benefits of an oral formulation have led to a change in the migraine treatment landscape in Korea, addressing an unmet need for migraine patients.\"\n\nFurthermore, Aquipta's once-daily oral formulation, with a half-life of less than 11 hours and high patient preference for oral formulations, will help improve treatment planning and treatment adherence for migraine patients in the future, she added.",

            "content": "So, you want to invest in AbbVie (ABBV -0.01%) because it's a promising dividend-paying stock, and you also want to receive $1,000 per year in dividend income from it. How many shares should you buy? The answer requires a little simple math.\n\nShares of AbbVie were recently trading for $212 apiece, and the company's total annual dividend amount (paid out over four quarters, like most dividend payers) is currently $6.56. The dividend might go up or down, but that's what it is as I write this.\n\nIf you're looking to collect $1,000, simply divide that $1,000 by $6.56. You'll get 152, which is the number of shares you'd need to own for a year to get $1,000 in dividend payments. At the recent share price, that would cost you $32,224.\n\nHmm...that might be a tall order for you. It would be for most Americans. Even if you could swing it by putting most of your portfolio into AbbVie, you'd then have too many eggs in that one basket. So consider including some other promising dividend stocks in your mix.\n\nNote, too, that like many healthy and growing dividend payers, AbbVie has been hiking its payout annually. So if you only buy enough to collect, say, $300 in annual income, that sum will likely grow over time.\n\nShould you invest in AbbVie?\n\nAbbVie is looking like a quite attractive investment. Spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, it's a major international pharmaceutical company with a recent market value near $380 billion, known for treatments in the fields of immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care.\n\nBulls are excited about its move into the weight loss drug arena and they love its dividend, too, which recently yielded 3.1% and has grown at an average annual rate of 7% over the past five years. Bears worry about how the company will make up for income lost due to patent protection expiration of blockbusters such as Humira, though AbbVie does have some new drugs selling briskly.",

See how AstraZeneca, Roche, AbbVie, and Medicus Pharma are leading the way.\n\nThe field of oncology is advancing with non-invasive treatments, next-generation immunotherapies, and AI-driven diagnostics, improving patient access, reducing treatment times, and enhancing early detection. Companies like Medicus Pharma Ltd (NASDAQ: MDCX), AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN), Roche (OTC: RHHBY) and AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) are all making headlines with innovative developments.\n\nAstraZeneca has acquired EsoBiotec to accelerate cell therapies for cancer treatment that could improve patient access and reduce treatment times. Roche and the University of Liverpool are launching an AI-driven tool for early eye cancer detection. Meanwhile, AbbVie recently initiated a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to discover and develop multi-specific biologic candidates in oncology and immunology. This partnership leverages AbbVie's expertise and Tentarix's proprietary platform.\n\nMedicus Pharma Ltd (NASDAQ: MDCX) is developing the SkinJect D-MNA patch for basal cell carcinoma (BCC)1, a proprietary microneedle array that is a non-invasive, painless, and cost-effective alternative to Mohs surgery, the current standard of care. A small, thumb-sized microneedle patch is applied to the skin over the BCC lesion. The patch is painless and easy to administer in a doctor\u2019s office and can be applied during just three weekly 30-minute visits over 2 weeks. This has the potential to provide a simple and affordable solution to BCC patients seeking better treatment options. With over 5 million BCC cases diagnosed annually in the U.S., Medicus Pharma targets a $2 billion share of the $15 billion North American skin cancer market. Its SkinJect patch has projected development costs of $75\u2013$100 million, far below the $648 million industry average2. Priced at around $1,000, it offers a cost-effective alternative to Mohs surgery ($1,800\u2013$2,500)3.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN) is enhancing its cancer treatment portfolio through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. In December 2023, it acquired Gracell Biotechnologies for $1.2 billion to bolster its cell therapy capabilities4. Recently, AstraZeneca agreed to acquire EsoBiotec for up to $1 billion5, gaining access to in-vivo CAR-T cell therapies that enable genetic modification of immune cells directly within the body, reducing treatment times from weeks to minutes. Additionally, AstraZeneca entered into a licensing agreement with South Korea\u2019s Alteogen6 to utilize its ALT-B4 hyaluronidase enzyme for developing subcutaneous formulations of several oncology therapies, potentially reducing administration times from 30-60 minutes to 3-5 minutes. In February 2024, AstraZeneca announced a $300 million investment in a new facility in Rockville, Maryland, dedicated to the discovery and development of cell therapies7.\n\nRoche Diagnostics, a division of Swiss pharma company Roche (OTC: RHHBY), has partnered with the University of Liverpool to launch the Eye Cancer Artificial Intelligence Digital Bioresource (EYE-CAN-AID) to improve early detection and treatment of rare eye cancers8. The initiative features high-quality imaging for more precise diagnoses. With around 1,000 new eye cancer cases annually in the UK, early detection is critical. EYE-CAN-AID integrates clinical, radiological, histological, and genetic data from NHS England\u2019s three specialist eye cancer centers, using AI-driven analysis for faster and more personalized treatments. The project builds on a 14-year-old biobank at the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre and benefits from Roche\u2019s support and secure IT infrastructure from ARO Tech. By advancing research into the causes of rare eye cancers, predictive biomarkers, and AI diagnostics, EYE-CAN-AID aims to enhance patient care, accelerate drug discovery, and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nAbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) and privately held Tentarix Biotherapeutics announced a multi-year collaboration in February 20249 to develop biologic candidates for oncology and immunology. This partnership combines AbbVie's expertise with Tentarix's Tentacles\u2122 platform, which creates biologics that activate immune cells while reducing side effects. Under the agreement, Tentarix received $64 million in upfront option payments for two programs, with AbbVie obtaining exclusive options to fully acquire these programs following candidate nomination, subject to additional undisclosed payments. The partnership aims to improve treatment safety and effectiveness, expanding AbbVie\u2019s pipeline while supporting Tentarix\u2019s development of targeted therapies. By combining resources, the companies seek to accelerate new treatment options for cancer and inflammatory diseases.\n\nOncology is advancing with non-invasive treatments, AI-driven diagnostics, and next-generation immunotherapies. Companies like AstraZeneca, Roche, AbbVie, and Medicus Pharma are driving innovation through acquisitions, AI-powered diagnostics, and novel biologics. These efforts aim to improve patient access, reduce treatment times, and enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies worldwide.\n\nDiscover more about Medicus Pharma and its plans to commercialize its non-invasive SkinJect patch for BCC.",

Watch part 1 of the interview to explore the similarities between the primary and final analyses of the trial.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity; captions were auto-generated.\n\nTranscript\n\nHow do the final MIRASOL results reinforce the efficacy of mirvetuximab soravtansine in patients with FR\u03b1+, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer?\n\nI think it's very important to realize that this is one of the longest follow-up times that we have ever seen in any of the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer studies. Usually, we don't see any benefit for the experimental arm in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, but this is one of the first studies in which we saw a benefit and it is maintained for a very long time. I think, in my opinion, this means that mirvetuximab is really to be considered the standard of care for FR\u03b1+, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nThe second thing is that it's also very important that we include FR\u03b1 testing in our standard of care so that we do this from the start, when we have the first diagnosis, or when the patient is first diagnosed with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, because I think it's really necessary for our patients to receive this treatment.\n\nHow might these findings influence treatment guidelines and the standard of care for this population?\n\nIn the US, the FDA already approved it, and it is already in the NCCN [National Comprehensive Cancer Network] guidelines. In Europe, we had to wait a little bit longer for approval, but I really hope that mirvetuximab will now be in the future guidelines for platinum-resistant ovarian cancers.\n\nThere is no doubt in my head that this will be the new standard of care all over the world. These results only reinforce the position of mirvetuximab in the platinum-resistant setting.",

            "content": "Big Pharma is staring down the barrel of blockbuster patent expirations over the next few years. Merck\u2019s Keytruda, for example, is far and away the best-selling drug on the planet at the moment, clocking in at nearly $30 billion in worldwide sales in 2024 , but will go off patent in 2028, and the industry is now racing to develop biosimilars to get a piece of the enormous PD-1 market share.\n\nLike many companies facing substantial loss of revenue due to loss of exclusivity, Merck is doing what it can to protect Keytruda. The pharma company has filed at least 129 patents since Keytruda\u2019s initial approval in 2014, most of which cover new indications and formulations for the drug, rather than the drug itself. This so-called patent thicket could theoretically push its protection into 2036. The company\u2019s patent dance has prompted investigation from the office of U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to investigate what she called Merck\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Novo Nordisk is taking a similar tack, building out a complex web of nearly two dozen patents for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, which came in second on last year\u2019s list of top-selling drugs with nearly $17 billion in sales. Novo has a little more breathing room before Ozempic, also marketed as Wegovy for weight loss, faces generic competition. While the first round of core patents are set to expire in 2026, a secondary group will give Novo exclusivity until 2033.\n\nBut if history is any guide, losing exclusivity is not always the death knell of a drug\u2019s profitability. Here, BioSpace explores the sales trajectories of recent blockbuster drugs, before and after they lost their patent, to search out a pattern in the post-exclusivity drug world.\n\nGSK\u2019s Advair\n\nIndication: COPD and asthma\n\nCOPD and asthma Peak Sales: $7.9 billion in 2013\n\n$7.9 billion in 2013 Year of Patent Expiry: 2010\n\nA new generation of asthma and COPD treatment arrived in the 1990s and 2000s, with Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca scooping up billions of dollars in sales with their inhalers. But GSK\u2019s multi-blockbuster treatment Advair beat them all when it hit the market in 2000, becoming the best-selling asthma drug on the market at its peak.\n\nThe drug lost its patent in 2010 but kept selling steadily for years afterward, hitting peak sales of about \u00a35.27 billion ($7.9 billion) in 2013. GSK\u2019s secret sauce was the specialized Diskus device for administering the drug that had its own separate patent kept generics out until 2019 . Generic drugmakers had to find their own device to match with the medicine, which proved difficult for several years. Because of that, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a classic generic collapse,\u201d analyst Paul Diggle predicted to Reuters in 2010, but rather a \u201cfairly slow collapsing pack of cards.\u201d The data show exactly that.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s Humira\n\nIndication: Rheumatoid arthritis, psioriasis, ulcerative colitis, other immune-related diseases\n\nRheumatoid arthritis, psioriasis, ulcerative colitis, other immune-related diseases Peak Sales: $21.2 billion in 2022\n\n$21.2 billion in 2022 Year of Patent Expiry: 2022\n\nBefore the earth-shaking numbers that Keytruda put up, AbbVie\u2019s arthritis drug Humira was the reigning champ. After gaining approval in 2008, AbbVie racked up indications in immunology and ran up to peak sales of more than $21 billion in 2022.\n\nThe drug\u2019s original patent was set to expire in 2016, but AbbVie for years fought off biosimilars through a blizzard of patents\u2014totaling more than 250 for a variety of indications beyond its original intended use in arthritis. That extended the drug\u2019s runway to 2022, when it finally lost exclusivity in the U.S. That extra time gave AbbVie the opportunity to set up two successor drugs: Skyrizi, which AbbVie bought from Boeringer Ingelheim in 2016 for $595 million, and Rinvoq, which AbbVie developed in-house.\n\nTogether, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have almost made up for Humira\u2019s dive off the patent cliff, totaling about $19 billion in sales in 2024. AbbVie expects Skyrizi and Rinvoq to hit a combined $27 billion in sales by 2027.\n\nAmgen\u2019s Neulasta\n\nIndication: Immune stimulation in chemotherapy patients\n\nImmune stimulation in chemotherapy patients Peak Sales: $5.8 billion in 2013\n\n$5.8 billion in 2013 Year of Patent Expiry: 2015\n\nAmgen\u2019s blockbuster drug Neulasta\u2014used to stimulate neutrophil growth primarily in patients undergoing chemotherapy\u2014was an annual top 10 best-selling drug for most of its exclusivity period and perennially one of Amgen\u2019s top sellers, going neck-and-neck with Amgen\u2019s arthritis treatment Enbrel.\n\nAmgen didn\u2019t use any special legal maneuvers to prolong the drug\u2019s life after the patent dropped in 2015 (aside from suing potential competitor Coherus, accusing it of poaching Amgen employees to learn about Neulasta). Amgen got lucky that companies jostling to produce their copycats struggled to gain FDA approval. Mylan finally got a biosimilar across the line in 2018, taking a bite out of Amgen\u2019s sales. Sandoz followed in 2019, pushing sales down further.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Lipitor\n\nIndication: High cholesterol\n\nHigh cholesterol Peak Sales: $12.9 billion in 2006\n\n$12.9 billion in 2006 Year of Patent Expiry: 2011\n\nLipitor had an outsized impact on the cardiology space. Its class of drugs\u2014statins \u2014were prescribed to more than 800 million people in 2019, with Lipitor and its generics accounting for nearly 300 million of those. After losing its patent back in 2011, Lipitor fell off a nearly picture-perfect patent cliff when generics immediately cut Pfizer\u2019s sales of the drug by two-thirds in a single year.\n\nPfizer spun off Lipitor and another legacy drug, Viagra, into a separate company, Viatris, in 2020, which has reported steady total sales of the drug of around $400 million per year for the last few years. Pfizer began selling its own Lipitor generic starting in 2011 in partnership with Watson Pharmaceuticals.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade\n\nIndication: Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis Peak Sales: $6.9 billion in 2016\n\n$6.9 billion in 2016 Year of Patent Expiry: 2016\n\nThe TNFa-blocking antibody Remicade was a blockbuster year after year for J&J\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit Janssen. It\u2019s one of the top five best selling drugs of all time, and the rheumatoid arthritis treatment hit its peak sales in 2016, going head-to-head with Humira in the space.\n\nJ&J spent practically the entire lifetime of the drug fighting tooth and nail to maintain patent exclusivity and protect its margins. In 2018, two lawyers from Brinks Gilson & Lione wrote in the National Law Review that J&J had tried and failed to \u201crewrite history\u201d with the games it played regarding Remicade\u2019s patent.",

This difference translated into a 37% reduction in the risk of tumor progression or death.\n\nThe objective response rate \u2014 the proportion of patients who saw a predefined reduction in tumor size over a set period of time \u2014 was also markedly higher in Elahere-treated patients (41.9% vs. 15.9%).\n\nElahere was also associated with a superior and clinically meaningful overall survival (median, 16.85 vs. 13.34 months), representing a 32% reduced risk of death. Treated patients also had a lower rate of severe or serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), or the need to discontinue treatment. The most common TEAEs, detected in at least 20% in the Elahere group, included blurred vision, problems affecting the cornea (the clear surface that covers the eye), dry eye, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, nausea and damage to peripheral nerves.\n\n\u201cThe final data showcase the significant improvement in overall survival benefit of treatment with Elahere compared to standard of care chemotherapy,\u201d said Toon Van Gorp, MD, PhD, a professor of gynecological oncology at the University of Leuven in Belgium. \u201cThe significant improvements in survival, along with the well-characterized safety profile, reinforce Elahere as an emerging standard of care for difficult to treat ovarian cancer and warrants further study of this medicine in earlier treatment settings.\u201d\n\nElahere is an antibody-drug conjugate administered into the bloodstream. It consists of an antibody that\u2019s designed to recognize and bind to the FR-alpha receptor on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. This antibody is chemically linked to DM4, a potent toxic agent.\n\nThe connection between DM4 and the antibody is made using a breakable linker. Once the antibody attaches to the FR-alpha receptor, Elahere is taken in by tumor cells. Inside the cell, the linker breaks down, releasing DM4 which then disrupts the cells\u2019 microtubule structure, which are essential components that maintain the cell shape and help transport molecules, ultimately leading to the cancer cells\u2019 death.",

The Office of Retirement and Disability Policy says Social Security's funds might run out by 2037, which could cut benefits to about 76% of what people get now.\n\nThat's why many investors are turning to dividend stocks for retirement income. But not all dividend stocks are good choices.\n\nThe best high-yield stocks share three key features:\n\nThey've paid dividends consistently through good markets and bad ones.\n\nTheir leaders prioritize paying shareholders.\n\nThey have advantages over competitors that help them stay profitable over the long term.\n\nHere are three great high-yield stocks that check all these boxes, making them smart picks for a retirement income portfolio.\n\nPharmaceutical giant with generous income potential\n\nAbbVie (ABBV -0.01%) stands out in the pharmaceutical landscape with its robust portfolio of immunology and oncology drugs. The company has successfully navigated the challenging transition away from its former blockbuster Humira, demonstrating the strength of its research-and-development (R&D) capabilities.\n\nAbbVie's newer immunology treatments Skyrizi and Rinvoq have shown impressive growth, with combined sales increasing 51% and 50%, respectively, in 2024. Management expects these drugs to reach $31 billion in combined sales by 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate exceeding 20%.\n\nWith a substantial 3% dividend yield, AbbVie offers immediate income that's 2.5 times higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. While the elevated 259% payout ratio might raise concerns, the company's strong cash flow and projected 5% average annual revenue growth through 2029 support dividend sustainability.\n\nFor income investors seeking exposure to healthcare, AbbVie presents a compelling combination of generous current yield, potential dividend growth, and promising long-term prospects as its next generation of immunology therapies continues to gain market share.\n\nHealthcare stalwart with an exceptional yield\n\nPfizer (PFE -0.21%) delivers one of the highest dividend yields among large-cap stocks at an impressive 6.6%. The pharmaceutical giant leverages its diversified portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas and a global distribution network to generate consistent cash flow.\n\nPfizer's extensive research capabilities and history of successful drug commercialization provide a solid foundation for future growth. The company maintains significant capital resources that enable it to invest in promising research while continuing to reward shareholders.\n\nDespite political uncertainties surrounding healthcare policy, analysts believe the most bearish scenarios for the pharmaceutical industry are unlikely. The bullish themes of solid innovation, productivity improvements, and new technologies continue to support Pfizer's long-term outlook, along with an aging global population.\n\nIncome investors willing to accept some political uncertainty in the healthcare sector can benefit from Pfizer's exceptional yield, which provides more than five times the income of the S&P 500 index, while waiting for a potential turnaround in the drugmaker's share price.\n\nEnergy major delivering reliable income\n\nChevron (CVX -0.32%) combines a generous 4.3% dividend yield with the financial stability of one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. The oil and gas giant recently demonstrated its commitment to shareholders by increasing its dividend by 5%, despite weakness in its downstream operations.\n\nChevron's global infrastructure and extensive reserves position it well to benefit from ever-rising energy demand. The company's management remains focused on capital discipline, cost reduction, and returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.\n\nWith a sustainable 67% payout ratio, Chevron offers more dividend security than many high-yield alternatives. Moreover, the company's projected production growth of 6% per year through 2026 provides a solid foundation for additional dividend increases down the road.\n\nFor investors seeking both substantial current income and inflation protection, Chevron represents an attractive option with its combination of high yield, regular dividend growth, and exposure to energy markets that can help hedge against rising prices in inflationary environments.",

AD is considered a complex disease with multiple contributing factors. Two main theories have been proposed to explain its development: the cholinergic hypothesis and the amyloid hypothesis. Additionally, various risk factors-including aging, genetic predisposition, head trauma, vascular conditions, infections, and environmental influences-contribute to the onset and progression of the disease.AD is characterized by two types of neuropathological changes that help explain disease progression and symptoms. The first type includes **positive lesions**, which result from accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, dystrophic neurites, neuropil threads, and other deposits in the brain. The second type consists of **negative lesions**, which involve significant brain atrophy due to the loss of neurons, synapses, and neuropil. Furthermore, additional mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and damage to cholinergic neurons, contribute to neurodegeneration.The symptoms of AD vary based on the disease stage. It is categorized into three phases: preclinical (or presymptomatic), mild, and dementia-stage, which differ from the DSM-5 classification of AD. The earliest and most prevalent symptom is episodic short-term memory loss, while long-term memory remains relatively intact in the beginning. Even if not the primary complaint, short-term memory impairment is typically detectable in most patients. As the disease progresses, individuals experience difficulties with problem-solving, judgment, executive functions, motivation, organization, multitasking, and abstract thinking. Executive function impairments range from mild to severe in the early stages, followed by language difficulties and visuospatial deficits.In the middle and later stages, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, social withdrawal, agitation, disinhibition, psychosis, and wandering often emerge. Over time, patients may develop dyspraxia (difficulty performing learned motor tasks), olfactory dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia, akathisia, and Parkinsonian-like features. In the final stages, primitive reflexes return, incontinence occurs, and patients become entirely dependent on caregivers for daily needs.Request for a detailed insights report on Alzheimer's disease pipeline insights @\"Alzheimer's disease Pipeline Insight 2025\" report by DelveInsight provides a comprehensive analysis of the ongoing clinical development activities and growth prospects across the Alzheimer's disease Therapeutics Market.Key Takeaways from the Alzheimer's disease Pipeline ReportDelveInsight's Alzheimer's disease pipeline report depicts a robust space with 110+ active players working to develop 120+ pipeline therapies for Alzheimer's disease treatment.Key Alzheimer's disease companies such as AriBio Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly & Co., Cognition Therapeutics, AbbVie Inc., Allyx Therapeutics, Inc., Cassava Sciences, BioVie Inc., Novo Nordisk, Alector Inc., Longeveron Inc., Cognition Therapeutics, TrueBinding, Inc., VT BIO, Luye Pharma Group Ltd., Lexeo Therapeutics, Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Regeneration Biomedical, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Sinotau Pharmaceutical Group, Eisai Inc., Shanghai Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and others are evaluating new drugs for Alzheimer's disease to improve the treatment landscape.Promising Alzheimer's disease pipeline therapies in various stages of development include AR1001, NE3107, LY3372689, CT1812, ABBV-916, ALX-001, and others.Recent breakthroughs in the Alzheimer's disease Pipeline Segment:In January 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for Leqembi, an amyloid beta-directed antibody targeting the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease by reducing amyloid plaques in the brain.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL and Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Co. HBB.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for AbbVie, Lockheed Martin and Dell\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Dell Technologies Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Co. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\n\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. It expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025 following the Humira LOE. AbbVie has been on an acquisition spree lately in its core space of immunology.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira\u2019s biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and slow market growth trend for Juvederm fillers in the United States and China.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -4.5%). The company remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The company\u2019s products are also well-acclaimed in the international market.\n\n\n\nThe increased funding offered for its defense products by the U.S. government should boost its business. The F-35 combat jet program remains a major revenue contributor for Lockheed. The company holds a strong solvency position.\n\n\n\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its programs that may lead to notable losses. A shortage of skilled labor in the aerospace and defense industry may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s future operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\n\n\n\nDell\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (-9.7% vs. +20.8%). The company is suffering from a challenging macroeconomic environment. It suffers from stiff competition in the PC market from the likes of HP and Lenovo.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Dell is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. Its PowerEdge XE9680L AI-optimized server is very much in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding Dell. It is witnessing demand from a diversified customer base that includes the likes of higher education institutions, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing.\n\n\n\nAn expanding partner base that includes the likes of NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Imbue has been a major growth driver. Dell\u2019s shareholder-friendly approach makes it an attractive investment.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Dell here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Hamilton Beach have declined -7.2% over the past year against the Zacks Household Appliances industry\u2019s decline of -8.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $268.27 million achieved a record gross margin of 26% in 2024, up 300 bps year over year, driven by lower costs, improved mix and pricing discipline. Operating profit rose 23.1% to $43.2 million.\n\n\n\nA strong cash flow of $65.4 million enabled debt elimination, ending with a net cash position of $0.6 million. HBB expanded into high-margin healthcare with HealthBeacon, targeting more than 50% patient growth in 2025. Product innovation, including premium offerings and e-commerce expansion, is driving market share gains. U.S. consumer sales rose 3.6%, with strong growth in Mexico and commercial blender placements.\n\n\n\nProactive tariff mitigation and supply-chain diversification protect margins. The 2025 guidance includes mid-single-digit revenue growth, operating profit outpacing sales and $40-$50 million in free cash flow.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Hamilton Beach here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

(Credit: AbbVie Inc.)\n\nAbbVie has revealed the final results of its Phase 3 MIRASOL trial, showing the efficacy and safety of Elahere (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) in patients with folate receptor alpha-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) when compared to chemotherapy.\n\nThe study, conducted over a median follow-up period of 30.5 months, highlighted notable improvements in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for those treated with Elahere.\n\nThe MIRASOL trial involved 453 participants, all diagnosed with high-grade serous epithelial PROC and exhibiting high levels of folate receptor alpha after up to three prior treatments.\n\nElahere demonstrated superior efficacy over investigator\u2019s choice chemotherapy, achieving a median PFS of 5.59 months in contrast to the 3.98 months observed with chemotherapy. This indicates a 37% reduction in the risk of tumour progression or death, with an objective response rate of 41.9% compared to 15.9%.\n\nFurthermore, the overall survival of patients receiving Elahere reached a median of 16.85 months, significantly surpassing the 13.34-month median for those undergoing chemotherapy. This marks a 32% reduction in the risk of death for Elahere recipients.\n\nAbbVie oncology medical affairs vice president Svetlana Kobina said: \u201cOvarian cancer can be devastating, and when cancer cells stop responding to chemotherapy patients may feel hopeless about their journey. The data presented today reinforce the importance of Elahere as a transformative therapy for patients with limited options.\n\n\u201cWe remain steadfast in our commitment to bring forward innovative therapies that improve the lives of patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.\u201d\n\nSafety analysis revealed that treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), such as blurred vision and fatigue, occurred less frequently with Elahere than with chemotherapy. This also resulted in fewer severe adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse effects.\n\nThe trial\u2019s key endpoints included PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, and OS. The study population was stratified based on prior lines of therapy and the type of chemotherapy received, with paclitaxel being the most common choice.\n\nElahere, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting folate receptor alpha, received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2024 and European Commission (EC) approval in November 2024. Applications for marketing authorisation are currently under assessment in various countries.\n\nAbbVie added the drug to its portfolio through the $10.1bn acquisition of ImmunoGen in 2023.",

It's important to understand 'on' and 'off' because that's actually what we use in the clinical trials to measure efficacy of medication.\"\n\nMartin spoke to the support group to share information about Vyalev, a subcutaneous pump that releases Parkinson's medication similar to an insulin pump for those living with diabetes. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this new medication distribution option is designed to help people who have trouble managing their symptoms or struggle with traditional medication.\n\nA main focus of the Coeur d'Alene Parkinson's Support Group is for attendees to share their experiences, emotional support and glean information from others about how they are coping, living and thriving with Parkinson's.\n\n\"If you've met one Parkinson's patient, you've met one Parkinson's patient because everyone's symptoms are so different,\" Coeur d'Alene Parkinson's Support Group Vice President Willynne Fenton said.\n\nFounded in 2006 and a nonprofit since 2012, the support group is for people with Parkinson\u2019s, their families and caregivers. Meetings are held in a casual setting normally the first Thursday of every month from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the Elks Lodge, 1170 W. Prairie Ave. Speakers from the medical community are often in attendance.\n\nMark Derry of Coeur d'Alene has been living with Parkinson's for 12 years. He is the only one in his family he knows of to be diagnosed.\n\n\"(It helps) just to know there's other people that are like me,\" said Derry, who has been to the support group meetings a few times. \"I can come in here, I can stumble around and shake around and be like everyone else. Even though they're different, the symptoms, we're all the same with the same problem.\"\n\nThe Coeur d'Alene Parkinson's Support Group also hosts a Women with Parkinson's Support Group the third Thursday of every month from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at MacKenzie River Pizza, 405 W. Canfield Ave., Coeur d'Alene; the Caregivers' Support Group, which meets throughout the year; Moving to the Music exercise sessions the second, third and fourth Thursdays of the month from 12:15 to 1 p.m. at the Elks Lodge; and Music and Wellness, led by a music therapist to help Parkinson's patients increase the volume of their voices and aid with the clarity of their speech. Music and Wellness meets on the second, third and fourth Thursday of the month from 11:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. at the Elks Lodge.\n\nMusic and Wellness and Moving to the Music will be held today and March 27.\n\nWomen with Parkinson's will next meet Thursday.\n\nBardenay Restaurant and Distillery will support the Coeur d'Alene Parkinson's Support Group with a fundraiser April 21 from 5 to 9 p.m. by donating 20% of all proceeds to the nonprofit. A Living Well with Parkinson's speaker event is also set for May 2, more information to come.\n\nInfo: cdaparkinsons.com\n\nJennifer Martin, a drug representative from Abbvie Pharmaceuticals, speaks about a subcutaneous pump that releases Parkinson's medication similar to an insulin pump for diabetes March 6 during a Coeur d'Alene Parkinson's Support Group meeting at the Coeur d'Alene Elks Lodge.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other best pharma stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhy is China the Talk of the Town in the Pharma Industry?\n\nThe US pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a distinct trend never seen before with large American pharma companies continually looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior.\n\nExperts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nAlthough the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe talked about the potential performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cOn February 20, Emily Field, Head of European Pharma Research at Barclays, appeared on CNBC to discuss the dynamics of the pharmaceutical sector, the impact of US tariffs, and the performance of obesity drugs. She believed the industry may not underperform this year, at least in the first half. However, there are still several questions surrounding the performance of obesity drugs, as major players in the domain have exhibited contrasting previous year performance. Talking about the tariffs, she said that their materialization poses a big open question for the pharmaceutical sector as some companies assemble their products in the US after manufacturing them abroad. Manufacturing costs are thus pretty low for these companies, which is a significant point to consider when determining the impact of tariffs. She believed that absorbing the additional cost of the tariffs would be very manageable for these companies. The market has reached the tail-end of the earnings season, and the situation hasn\u2019t come up much on earnings calls over this quarter.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 25 pharma stocks. We then selected the top 11 with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a research-based pharmaceutical company that develops and sells products to treat chronic diseases in oncology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, dermatology, virology, and various other serious health conditions.\n\nIt also has strong fundamentals and generated $15.1 billion in revenue in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 5.6% growth and exceeding analyst expectations. This growth was attributed to its ex-Humira platform, a drug collection in the company\u2019s pharmaceutical portfolio. The platform delivered more than 18% full-year sales growth, with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in fiscal Q4 2024.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about AbbVie Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) growth, primarily because of its two blockbuster drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These drugs, which target dermatology, rheumatology, psoriatic diseases, and inflammatory bowel disorders, are projected to exceed $27 billion in annual sales by 2027. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) also announced a dividend increase of 5.8%, effective February 2025, continuing its trend of increasing dividends for 12 consecutive years.\n\nPolaris Capital Management said the following about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUS biopharma/biotech companies topped the health care sector, with the majority of holdings posting returns in excess of 10%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) showed positive top-line growth from its immunosuppressive drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Abbvie\u2019s management continues to work through the loss of exclusivity from Humira, switching patients to Skyrizi or Rinvoq rather than Humira biosimilars.\u201d\n\nOverall, ABBV ranks 6th on our list of the best pharma stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABBV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In a report released yesterday, Luisa Hector from Berenberg Bank maintained a Hold rating on AbbVie (ABBV \u2013 Research Report), with a price target of $195.00.\n\nLuisa Hector\u2019s rating is based on a combination of factors including AbbVie\u2019s current valuation and future prospects. The company\u2019s share price has already appreciated significantly, reflecting the increased earnings forecasts driven by strong sales of Skyrizi. This has led to a fair valuation, prompting the decision to maintain a Hold rating while raising the target price to USD195.\n\nAdditionally, while Skyrizi\u2019s sales potential is promising, contributing significantly to the company\u2019s net present value, there are concerns such as the recent intangible impairments due to a disappointing drug readout. Furthermore, the pipeline for 2025 appears relatively quiet, with limited catalysts expected. The current trading multiples also suggest that AbbVie\u2019s valuation is full, as it trades above the sector median, reinforcing the Hold recommendation.\n\nIn another report released on March 4, Bernstein also reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $203.00 price target.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 48 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of ABBV in relation to earlier this year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.76% for the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.18%.\n\nShares of the drugmaker witnessed a gain of 13.83% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Medical sector with its loss of 0.37% and the S&P 500's loss of 7.29%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of AbbVie in its upcoming release. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.51, indicating an 8.66% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $12.92 billion, showing a 4.94% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nABBV's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.30 per share and revenue of $59.52 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +21.54% and +5.66%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AbbVie. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.15% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, AbbVie is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, AbbVie is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.61. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.67 for its industry.\n\nOne should further note that ABBV currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.48. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.33 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 87, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.",

(Nasdaq: XLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and developing tumor-activated immuno-oncology therapies for people living with cancer, today announced pipeline progress and business updates and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\u201cWe started 2025 with multiple promising updates across our pipeline, including encouraging initial Phase 2 combination data for vilastobart, our tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4, in patients with late-line MSS CRC, a difficult to treat, immunologically cold tumor type that is increasing in incidence, particularly in younger people,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Russo, Pharm.D., president and chief executive officer of Xilio. \u201cThese data included a preliminary 27% objective response rate in patients without liver metastases and continue to support a differentiated safety profile, including a low incidence of immune-related adverse events and only 5% of patients reporting colitis. We look forward to reporting additional data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial in the middle of this year.\u201d\n\nDr. Russo added, \u201cIn addition, we are excited to be advancing multiple novel masked T cell engager programs internally and as part of our recently announced collaboration with AbbVie. Each of these programs leverages our clinically-validated, tumor-activation technology, which we believe has great potential to enhance the activity and tolerability of T cell engagers and open up promising new targets within this class of immunotherapies.\u201d\n\nPipeline and Business Updates\n\nVilastobart: tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced, high affinity binding anti-CTLA-4\n\nVilastobart is an investigational tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced, high affinity binding anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody designed to block CTLA-4 and deplete regulatory T cells when activated in the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n\nIn January 2025, Xilio announced encouraging initial data from its ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating vilastobart at a dose of 100 mg once every six weeks (Q6W) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq \u00ae ) at 1200 mg once every three weeks (Q3W) in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). As of a data cutoff date of January 13, 2025, these data demonstrated a preliminary 27% objective response rate in patients without liver metastases, and responses were accompanied by decreases in levels of serum tumor biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen and circulating tumor DNA) as well as improvement in clinical symptoms. In addition, as of the data cutoff date, the combination was generally well-tolerated, with patients experiencing a low incidence of immune-related adverse events and only 5% of patients reporting colitis. These safety data continue to support the potential for vilastobart to be a differentiated next-generation anti-CTLA-4 in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitors.

These safety data continue to support the potential for vilastobart to be a differentiated next-generation anti-CTLA-4 in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitors. For more information, read the press release . Xilio expects to report updated data from the Phase 2 clinical trial in the middle of 2025, including additional response assessments and follow-up. In addition, Xilio continues to enroll patients in Phase 1C (combination dose escalation) evaluating vilastobart at the 150 mg Q6W dose level in combination with atezolizumab at 1200 mg Q3W.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the promising initial Phase 2 proof-of-concept data, Xilio plans to seek opportunities for partnering to accelerate and expand further development of vilastobart.\n\n\n\nXTX301: tumor-activated IL-12\n\nXTX301 is an investigational tumor-activated IL-12 designed to potently stimulate anti-tumor immunity and reprogram the TME of poorly immunogenic \u201ccold\u201d tumors towards an inflamed or \u201chot\u201d state. In March 2024, Xilio entered into an exclusive license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) related to Xilio\u2019s tumor-activated IL-12 program, including XTX301.\n\nIn December 2024, Xilio announced preliminary data from its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of XTX301 in patients with advanced solid tumors. As of the data cutoff date of November 25, 2024, XTX301 was generally well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity or a dose reduction due to a treatment-related adverse event. In addition, XTX301 showed evidence of sustained interferon gamma signaling without evidence of tachyphylaxis throughout treatment cycles. Tachyphylaxis has historically limited other IL-12 agents. For more information, read the press release here .\n\n\n\n\n\n. A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been established, and Xilio continues to enroll patients in Phase 1A monotherapy dose escalation and Phase 1B monotherapy dose expansion of the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of XTX301.\n\n\n\nXTX501: masked PD-1/IL-2 bispecific\n\n\n\nXTX501 is a novel, tumor-activated bispecific PD-1/IL-2 designed to selectively stimulate PD-1 positive, antigen-experienced T cells and enhance their function. XTX501 incorporates masking designed to overcome IL-2 receptor-mediated clearance and peripheral activity. In preclinical studies, XTX501 demonstrated robust monotherapy activity (including in settings insensitive to PD-1) and tumor-selective pharmacodynamics consistent with its intended mechanism of action. Xilio is currently advancing XTX501 in investigational new drug (IND) application enabling studies and plans to submit an IND application for XTX501 in the middle of 2026.\n\nMasked T Cell Engager Programs\n\n\n\nXilio is leveraging its proprietary, clinically-validated tumor-activation platform to advance multiple preclinical programs for masked T cell engagers, including wholly-owned programs targeting the tumor-associated antigens for PSMA, CLDN18.2 and STEAP1 and an additional program in collaboration with AbbVie.\n\nXilio\u2019s masked T cell engager programs include bispecific molecules designed using its advanced tumor-activated cell engager (ATACR) format, which consists of a T cell engager with a masked CD3 targeting domain, and tri-specific molecules designed using its selective effector-enhanced cell engager (SEECR) format. The SEECR format builds upon the ATACR format by adding co-stimulatory signaling designed to further enhance potency and T cell activation.\n\nPSMA has demonstrated potential as a T cell engager target for prostate cancer. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its PSMA program in the ATACR format in the third quarter of 2025 and submitting an IND application in the first quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLDN18.2 has broad potential as a T cell engager target for gastric, pancreatic, esophageal and lung cancers. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its CLDN18.2 program in the ATACR format in the fourth quarter of 2025 and submitting an IND application in the second quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEAP1 has broad potential as a T cell engager target for prostate, colorectal and lung cancers. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its STEAP1 program in the SEECR format in the first half of 2026 and submitting an IND application in the second half of 2027.\n\n\n\nCorporate Updates\n\n\n\nIn February 2025, Xilio announced a collaboration, license and option agreement with AbbVie leveraging Xilio\u2019s proprietary tumor-activation technology and platform to discover and develop novel tumor-activated immunotherapies, including masked T cell engagers. In the first quarter of 2025, Xilio received $52.0 million in upfront payments from AbbVie, including a $10.0 million equity investment, and Xilio will be eligible to receive up to approximately $2.1 billion in total contingent payments for option-related fees and milestones plus tiered royalties.

            "content": "AbbVie is navigating significant shareholder activism as it urges opposition to two governance proposals ahead of its May 2025 meeting, fostering investor attention. Despite reporting a Q4 net loss, the company's stock surged by 23% in the last quarter, countering market volatility driven by tariff announcements from the Trump administration, which left major indices like the Dow and S&P 500 in decline. AbbVie's recent product approvals, such as the availability of SKYRIZI in Canada and regulatory progress on RINVOQ in Europe, possibly buoyed investor sentiment along with the anticipation of leadership changes with CEO Robert A. Michael's impending chairmanship. Furthermore, AbbVie\u2019s announcement of a dividend, its strategic financial maneuvers, including share repurchases, and its credit facility agreement might have bolstered investor confidence, even as the broader market experienced a 5% drop amid economic uncertainty.\n\nNavigate through the intricacies of AbbVie with our comprehensive report here.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, AbbVie's total shareholder return reached 260.04%, a remarkable performance that outpaced broader market metrics. Contributing to this impressive return are elements such as its consistent and increasing dividends, as evidenced by the rise from US$1.30 to US$1.64 per share in recent years. The company has also engaged in strategic alliances and partnerships, notably with AbCellera and EvolveImmune Therapeutics, which have enhanced its research capabilities and product portfolio. This collaborative approach, alongside the FDA approval of innovative products like EMBLAVEO, has reinforced investor confidence.\n\nDespite facing challenges such as fluctuating profit margins and significant one-off financial impacts, AbbVie has maintained a strong position relative to the market and its peers. The company's earnings exceeded both the US Biotechs industry's decline of 6.7% and the broader market's 8.8% over the past year. Leadership changes, including Robert A. Michael's upcoming chairmanship, further signify AbbVie's strategic foresight in adapting to industry demands.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

But even as the market is going to heck in a handbasket, AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) keeps chugging higher, observes Tom Hutchinson, editor of Cabot Income Advisor.\n\nThe big issue seems to be tariffs. Tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico are escalating. The new Canadian Prime Minister also appears to be taking a hard line, and it looks like the trade issues won\u2019t be resolved for a while. But it\u2019s also the fact that tariffs are hitting the economy at a vulnerable point as fears of a slowing economy are growing.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\n\n\n\nAs for ABBV, it yields 3.1%. Plus, as a healthcare company, its business isn\u2019t negatively affected by a slower economy or probable tariffs. Meanwhile, the ascent that began after the earnings report in January continues.\n\nImmunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq have collectively made up for lost Humira revenue. The company also raised revenue forecasts on the two drugs by $4 billion to $31 billion-a-year by 2027. The earnings report showed Abbvie has replaced the Humira revenue and is poised for solid earnings growth.\n\nAt a new high, there should be a time in the coming days or weeks when a covered call makes sense.\n\nRecommended Action: Buy ABBV.\n\nSubscribe to Cabot Income Advisor here\u2026",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\n\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\n\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\n\nReal time prices by BATS.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have taken a backseat in the market as technology and AI-driven equities have soared to record highs. However, analysts at Ned Davis Research believe that a more challenging macroeconomic landscape this year could create opportunities for dividend stocks to regain momentum.\n\nAmid concerns about economic growth and uncertainty surrounding former President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been turning to defensive strategies. In this environment, dividend stocks have proven resilient, offering both stability and attractive passive income. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a history of at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has climbed by over 5.3% in 2025. In contrast, the broader market has declined by nearly 1.7%, as of the close of March 7.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nWhile analysts remain cautious about the market\u2019s ability to sustain its recent gains, dividend stocks have increasingly drawn their attention for several reasons. According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nThe report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.\n\nCompanies with a history of regular dividend payments are generally seen as stable investments, reflecting their strong cash flow and financial resilience. These businesses are often found in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations. As a result, they help investors manage portfolio risks more effectively. At the beginning of 2025, growing concerns over rising inflation and sluggish economic growth led investors to increase their exposure to defensive stocks. This shift in strategy was intended to protect portfolios from potential market volatility linked to these economic uncertainties.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team shared their perspective on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have delivered positive returns in 2025. From that group, we identified dividend companies with strong dividend policies and stable cash positions. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 14 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of March 7, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds.

            "content": "It's not too often that pharmaceutical drugs become household names, but that's happening with medicines in the weight loss market. Brands such as Wegovy and Zepbound -- the leading anti-obesity therapies -- are now well known and are generating billions of dollars in annual sales. That's why other drugmakers want to dip their toes in this lucrative and high-growth market.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV -0.72%) is one of them. The company, best known for its work in immunology, recently made a move to enter the weight loss space. Does that make AbbVie stock a buy today?\n\nAbbVie signs a licensing agreement\n\nDeveloping therapies from scratch is risky and time-consuming. That's why pharmaceutical giants often partner with small companies that already have candidates in early-stage studies -- it helps speed up the process from their perspective. AbbVie is doing just that to join the weight loss market. The company entered into an agreement with Gubra A/S, a Danish drugmaker, to develop GUB014295, a potential weight loss therapy.\n\nMany investigational anti-obesity treatments -- and the current leaders in the field -- mimic the action of the GLP-1 hormone, but that's not GUB014295's approach. Instead, this investigational medicine mimics the activity of two hormones: amylin and calcitonin. The former helps regulate blood sugar levels and controls satiety. The latter regulates calcium levels in the blood.\n\nPer its agreement with Gubra A/S, AbbVie will lead the development of GUB014295. Gubra A/S received an upfront payment of $350 million and could get up to $1.9 billion in various development milestones in addition to royalties.\n\nIt's still a long shot\n\nCan AbbVie become a leader in the weight loss market? It's too early to say. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the two companies behind Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, still seem to have a hold on this therapeutic area considering their rich late-stage pipelines of potential GLP-1 therapies. Further, the number of investigational medicines in this field has ballooned in the last two years.\n\nBeing first to market matters, but so does having the most effective medicine. Also, it will still be a while before GUB014295 hits the market, that is, if it passes all the clinical and regulatory hoops on the way. So, for now, this licensing agreement should do little to sway investors' decision to purchase shares of AbbVie.\n\nThere are other reasons to invest\n\nThankfully, there are many other things going AbbVie's way. Despite losing patent exclusivity for Humira two years ago, AbbVie's financial results remain pretty strong. In 2024, the company's revenue increased by 3.7% to $56.3 billion. AbbVie's adjusted earnings per share decreased by 8.9% to $10.12, but that was partly due to acquisition-related expenses. AbbVie's two immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, were the stars of the show, once again.\n\nManagement continues to expect these two drugs to grow their sales at a good clip well into the next decade. The company has other growth drivers, including its Botox franchise and Venclexta, a cancer medicine. AbbVie also has a deep pipeline with dozens of drug candidates. The company's entrance into the weight loss market helps diversify its clinical lineup. Even if GUB014295 fails, we can expect AbbVie to make other attempts to join the lucrative anti-obesity space. Whether in this area or others, the company will develop more successful medicines.\n\nLastly, AbbVie is an excellent dividend stock. When counting its time as a division of the medical device giant Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie has increased its payouts for 52 consecutive years. It offers a forward yield of 3.1%, and its cash payout ratio of just under 62% is reasonable. AbbVie may or may not become a leader in the weight loss market anytime soon, but its excellent dividend track record and strong underlying business make it attractive for long-term, income-seeking investors.",

Conversely, levels of melanocyte-associated proteins such as Kit and Rab27b were significantly lower.\n\nFurthermore, baseline Kit levels correlated with depigmentation severity as measured by the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI).\n\nFollowing treatment with upadacitinib, CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels rapidly declined, reaching levels comparable to healthy volunteers within 4 weeks and remaining suppressed through week 24.\n\nSimultaneously, melanocyte-associated markers increased, with Kit levels at week 24 showing a strong correlation with VASI scores, suggesting a direct link between biomarker restoration and repigmentation. By week 24, CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels no longer correlated with VASI scores, reinforcing the hypothesis that melanocyte-associated proteins serve as a better indicator of disease activity.\n\nClinical Implications\n\nAccording to authors of the abstract, these findings suggest that circulating melanocyte biomarkers could offer a quantitative means to assess vitiligo progression and treatment response.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlights the role of systemic inflammation in vitiligo pathology and how targeted JAK1 inhibition with upadacitinib can modulate these pathways to support repigmentation.\n\nReference",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy now.\n\nDividend stocks remain a popular choice among investors due to their ability to generate steady income. Experienced investors, including Warren Buffett, have long recognized their value, as evidenced by the significant presence of dividend-paying stocks in his portfolio. While often underestimated, dividends have played a crucial role in overall investment returns. Between 1960 and the end of last year, approximately 85% of the broader market\u2019s total cumulative return stemmed from reinvested dividends and the benefits of compounding. Strategies centered around dividend-paying stocks offer the potential for greater stability, consistent income, and a safeguard against economic uncertainty, making them a strong choice for resilient portfolios.\n\nWith ongoing tariff uncertainty in the U.S. contributing to market volatility, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-focused strategies to strengthen portfolio stability. After a period dominated by growth stocks, interest in dividend investing has gained momentum. Over the six months leading up to January 31, 2025, US-listed dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion, a sharp rise from the $107 million seen during the same period the previous year, according to a report by Franklin Templeton. Amid an uncertain global economic outlook, investors are seeking more stable assets to create balanced portfolios. Dividend stocks, particularly those with strong fundamentals, tend to provide steady and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a key role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic or fair value of dividend-paying stocks is generally more straightforward compared to assessing the value of growth stocks.\n\nREAD ALSO: 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDividend stocks are attractive due to their ability to reduce volatility during market downturns while still providing meaningful growth potential. Historically, dividend-focused strategies have shown resilience across different regions and time periods. The Franklin Templeton report further highlighted that over the three years ending December 31, 2024, dividend-paying stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns compared to the broader market across global, US, and European segments. When inflation and interest rate concerns resurfaced last August, dividend stocks proved to be relatively stable in comparison.\n\nAmong dividend stocks, investors are more inclined to companies that have raised their payouts consistently. A report by Nuveen indicated that companies initiating or increasing dividends have historically performed well in the three years following an initial Federal Reserve interest rate hike. While the Fed began lowering rates in 2024, the report suggested that rate cuts would proceed at a slower pace in 2025 due to persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nGiven the higher interest rate environment, the report emphasized the importance of focusing on dividend-paying companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, healthy free cash flow, and management teams committed to sustainable dividend growth. In contrast, sectors with high yields but elevated debt levels could face challenges due to their sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, also noted that companies with a strong history of increasing dividend payments are typically well-capitalized and financially stable, making them less volatile than the broader market. He suggested that including such companies in an investment portfolio could help reduce fluctuations. Stovall also pointed out that dividend-paying firms generally experience lower volatility compared to those that do not offer dividends. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:PEP) is frequently seen as a beverage company, which isn\u2019t inaccurate since it offers a wide variety of drinks under its well-known brand. However, the company has a much broader reach, as it also produces and markets snacks and packaged food products. In fact, its snack segment may be even more compelling than its beverage division, considering that while PepsiCo holds the second-largest position in the non-alcoholic beverage market, it leads the salty snack category through its Frito-Lay business.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) delivered stable earnings in fiscal year 2024, posting $91.8 billion in revenue, a slight increase from $91.4 billion in the prior year. Operating profit climbed to $12.8 billion from $11.9 billion in FY23, while net income also rose to $9.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects organic revenue to grow at a low-single-digit rate, with mid-single-digit growth in core constant currency EPS.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a solid cash position. In FY24, the company generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. For FY25, it plans to return approximately $7.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. On February 3, the company announced a 5% increase in its annual dividend to $5.69 per share, marking its 53rd consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 3.5%, as of March 9.\n\n9. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\n5-Year Average Dividend Growth Rate: 7.46%\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an Illinois-based multinational pharmaceutical company that mainly focuses on developing and commercializing innovative treatments across various healthcare fields. The company is a major pharmaceutical company with a diverse portfolio spanning immunology, oncology, neurology, and eye care. It also holds a strong position in the aesthetics market, offering well-known cosmetic products such as Juvederm and Botox for skincare and anti-aging treatments. Since the beginning of 2025, the stock has gained more than 19%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, AbbVie Inc.

            "content": "We wouldn't blame AbbVie Inc. ( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Richard Gonzalez, the Executive Chairman recently netted about US$20m selling shares at an average price of US$205. That sale reduced their total holding by 19% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.\n\nAbbVie Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Richard Gonzalez was the biggest sale of AbbVie shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$211). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 19% of Richard Gonzalez's holding.\n\nInsiders in AbbVie didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nDoes AbbVie Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. AbbVie insiders own about US$290m worth of shares (which is 0.08% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The AbbVie Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nBut note: AbbVie may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nIf you're looking to trade AbbVie , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks With At Least $10 Million In Insider Sales Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other stocks.\n\nSome of the major U.S. indexes began recovering on Wednesday, following the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of a one-month delay on tariffs for automakers meeting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) requirements. The news sparked enthusiasm among traders, who began hoping for additional exemptions, causing the major stock indexes to rise slightly.\n\nBlue-chip companies gained 485.60 points or 1.14%, the broader market index rose 1.12%, while the NASDAQ stocks increased 1.46%. These rebounds come during a volatile week following a period of consecutive declines.\n\nAlthough many analysts have lowered their U.S. stock forecasts, citing that strong earnings in 2025 may be more challenging to achieve, the broader market index is still projected to end the year about 9% higher than in 2024. However, this is lower than the initial forecast of 12.2%, made in early January.\n\nOn the other hand, the big bets for this year are a productivity boost from the adoption of AI and the projection of lower interest rates. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said that while tariffs are never good for Wall Street, investors should take advantage of these periods to invest in the best tech stocks, reports CNN Business.\n\nAmid market fluctuations and uncertainty, insider trading often attracts significant attention. Executives and insiders, with their in-depth knowledge of company strategies, plans, and future prospects, may make trades worth analyzing. For instance, when a CEO or CFO invests their own funds in company stock, it can serve as a strong indicator of confidence in the company\u2019s future potential.\n\nSelling shares, on the other hand, may suggest that management is losing confidence, though this is not always the case. In some instances, large shareholders may simply be rebalancing their portfolios to better align with their desired risk/reward profile or selling for personal financial reasons. Additionally, many insiders sell shares as part of pre-arranged, automated trading plans known as 10b5-1 plans.\n\nBoth insider buying and selling can be influenced by various factors, so these actions should be interpreted within the broader context of the company\u2019s financial health, industry trends, and overall market conditions. This highlights the importance of conducting thorough research before making investment decisions. While insider trading activity can offer valuable insights into a company\u2019s prospects, it should be considered alongside other critical factors to ensure well-informed investment choices.\n\nToday, we\u2019re focusing on stocks that have seen insider sales of at least $10 million since the start of the year. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading screener, we identified stocks where at least one insider sale reached $10 million or more. While the total value of insider sales for these stocks may be higher, we focused on sales worth $10 million or more. Out of the stocks that met this criterion, we selected the 10 stocks with insider sales ranging from $10 million to $20 million, prioritizing those with the highest insider sales within this range for further analysis.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFor each stock, we provide details on the highest individual sale, the number of insider sales exceeding $10 million year-to-date, and the company\u2019s current market capitalization. Let\u2019s take a look at 10 stocks with at least $10 million in insider sales since the beginning of the year.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nHighest Individual Sale: $18,964,470.60\n\nNumber of Sales Above $10 million: 1\n\nMarket Capitalization: $373.44 billion\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of advanced therapies across various healthcare sectors. The North Chicago, Illinois-headquartered company offers a broad range of treatments in immunology, oncology, neurology, and eye care. It also markets well-known cosmetic products such as Juvederm and Botox for skincare and anti-aging.\n\nOn February 28, one insider sold $18.96 million worth of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) shares at a price of $205.11 per share. AbbVie shares jumped that day on the news that The European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP has recommended approving upadacitinib for treating adults with giant cell arteritis (GCA). The final decision from the European Commission is expected by mid-2025. If approved, upadacitinib would be the first oral advanced therapy for adults with GCA.\n\nCurrently, the stock is trading at $211.54 per share, having risen 19.04% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 12 months, AbbVie returned 16.83% to its investors.\n\nIn March, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) and Gubra A/S (CPSE:GUBRA), announced a licensing agreement to develop GUB014295, a potential long-acting amylin analog for obesity treatment. GUB014295, currently in Phase 1 trials, is designed to activate amylin and calcitonin receptors, with amylin identified as a key target for obesity treatment. AbbVie views this partnership as an opportunity to enter the obesity field and drive long-term growth.\n\nTwenty-one analysts have given an average \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stock, with a price target of $212.7, according to Stock Analysis.\n\nAbbVie is also one of the 10 most undervalued long term stocks to buy now.\n\nOverall ABBV ranks 10th on our list of the stocks with at least $10 million in insider sales recently. While we acknowledge the potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "This week, Bayer BAYRY announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. AbbVie ABBV announced a licensing deal with Danish firm Gubra for an amylin-targeting obesity treatment, which marked the company\u2019s entry into the obesity space. Novo Nordisk NVO announced that it is cutting the price of its popular obesity injection, Wegovy, for the uninsured following a similar move by rival Eli Lilly. J&J JNJ discontinued a phase III study on a candidate being evaluated as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (aMDD). The FDA accepted Roche\u2019s RHHBY application seeking expanded use of its lymphoma drug, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, for the treatment of lupus nephritis.\n\nHere's a recap of the week\u2019s most important stories.\n\nNVO Cuts Wegovy\u2019s Price Following Similar Move by LLY\n\nNovo Nordisk is launching a new direct-to-patient online pharmacy called NovoCare, which will offer Wegovy at a discounted price of $499 per month, less than half of its listed price. This offer is for patients who do not have insurance coverage and pay by cash as well as those with insurance but have no coverage for obesity medicines. The website provides an option for these patients to have their injections delivered to their homes.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s announcement follows a similar move by rival Eli Lilly. Last week, Lilly also announced that it is reducing the prices of its 7.5 mg and 10 mg single-dose vials of obesity treatment Zepbound to $499 per month for customers paying through a new self-pay program called LillyDirect Self-Pay Pharmacy Solutions.\n\nBAYRY Reports Q4 Earnings Decline, Issues Guidance for 2025\n\nBayer\u2019s fourth-quarter core earnings of \u20ac1.05 per share declined 43.2% year over year.

Pharmaceuticals segment sales increased 2.4%, while Consumer Health sales declined 0.9% on a currency and portfolio-adjusted basis.\n\nIn the Pharmaceuticals segment, sales of new products, cancer drug Nubeqa and kidney drug, Kerendia, remained strong, offsetting the loss of exclusivity impact on sales of oral anticoagulant Xarelto. The pace of growth in the Consumer Health business has slowed down. The Crop Science business was adversely impacted by lower prices in the crop protection business due to competitive pricing pressure.\n\nBayer issued a financial guidance for 2025. The company expects 2025 to be a \u201cpivotal year\u201d and the most difficult in terms of financial performance. Sales are expected to be in the range of \u20ac45-\u20ac47 billion in 2025.

            "content": "Korean patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis now have greater flexibility in treatment as reimbursement has been expanded to allow switching between biologic agents and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.\n\nThe expanded reimbursement will especially have a positive impact on AbbVie Korea\u2019s Rinvoq (ingredient: upadacitinib), which can be used for adolescents aged 12 and older under expanded coverage, reinforcing its role in personalized treatment strategies.\n\nThese changes aim to provide more tailored therapeutic options for patients struggling with inadequate responses or adverse effects from existing therapies.\n\nAbbVie Korea held a press conference at the Park Hyatt Seoul Friday to highlight the latest clinical research on Rinvoq and discuss the impact of changes to atopic dermatitis reimbursement criteria.\n\nAccording to the Korean Atopic Dermatitis Association\u2019s treatment guidelines, patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who experience inadequate response or adverse effects with a biologic agent or JAK inhibitor should consider switching to another biologic or JAK inhibitor.\n\nPreviously, such treatment switches were not reimbursed, posing challenges for clinicians and patients. However, as of March 1, reimbursement is now granted when switching between biologic agents and JAK inhibitors under certain conditions -- either due to lack of efficacy or the occurrence of adverse effects.\n\nThe newly selected treatment must be continued for at least six months, and switching between drugs of the same class remains non-reimbursable.\n\nProfessor Han Tae-young at Nowon Eulji Medical Center explains the significance of the reimbursement expansion that now allows switching between biologic agents and Janus kinase inhibitors. (Credit: AbbVie Korea)\n\n\"Atopic dermatitis is a complex disease with varying symptoms and severity among patients, necessitating personalized treatment approaches,\u201d Professor Han Tae-young of the Department of Dermatology at Nowon Eulji Medical Center said. \u201cThe approval of reimbursement for treatment switching provides new therapeutic opportunities for patients who previously did not achieve sufficient efficacy.\"\n\nThe change is particularly significant for Rinvoq, which has been directly compared to Dupixent (ingredient: dupilumab) in the Heads Up clinical trial.\n\nThe study found that among patients who switched from Dupixent (300mg) to Rinvoq (30mg) after 24 weeks, 90 percent achieved EASI 90 (almost clear skin) and 56.1 percent achieved WP-NRS 0/1 (minimal or no itching) at 16 weeks following the switch.\n\nProfessor Jang Yong-hyun at Kyungpook National University College of Medicine speaks at the same conference. (Credit: AbbVie Korea)\n\nProfessor Jang Yong-hyun of the Department of Dermatology at Kyungpook National University College of Medicine also emphasized the importance of early and effective treatment.\n\n\"In moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, achieving rapid symptom relief\u2014especially reducing severe itching\u2014is crucial,\u201d Jang said. \u201cWith the expansion of reimbursement for treatment switching, Rinvoq becomes an even more viable first-line treatment option.\"\n\nRinvoq\u2019s long-term clinical benefits have been demonstrated in phase 3 trials, Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, which followed patients for approximately four years.\n\nResults showed that 69.8 percent of patients on Rinvoq 15mg and 72.9 percent on Rinvoq 30mg maintained EASI 90 responses, while WP-NRS 0/1 responses were sustained in 44.9 percent and 47.2 percent of patients, respectively.\n\nSafety data from an extended six-year study (over 9,000 patients) reaffirmed Rinvoq\u2019s consistent safety profile.\n\nRecent international guidelines also support the use of JAK inhibitors for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The European Dermatology Guidelines classify Rinvoq as a fast-acting treatment, making it a preferred option for patients requiring immediate symptom control.\n\nAnother major development for Rinvoq is its recent approval and reimbursement expansion for adolescents aged 12 and older weighing at least 40kg.\n\nThis is particularly significant given that adolescence is a critical period for growth, development, and emotional well-being. Severe atopic dermatitis can cause significant distress, particularly when lesions appear on visible areas such as the face and neck.\n\n\"Since adolescence is a crucial time to prevent the worsening of atopic dermatitis into adulthood, early intervention is key,\u201d Jang said. \u201cThe reimbursement approval for Rinvoq 30mg allows for rapid and optimal symptom control, followed by a maintenance strategy with Rinvoq 15mg, enabling more flexible treatment planning.\"\n\nWith the approval of treatment switching, Rinvoq is expected to incur additional reimbursement claims, resulting in a price reduction based on the calculation formula.\n\nEffective from March, the maximum price for Rinvoq 15mg will be reduced from 18,740 won ($12.96) to 18,328 won, while Rinvoq 30mg will decrease from 29,850 won to 29,193 won.",

We have compiled a complete list of all Dividend Aristocrats and relevant financial metrics such as dividend yields and price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nYou can download your free list of all the Dividend Aristocrats by clicking on the link below:\n\nDisclaimer: Sure Dividend is not affiliated with S&P Global in any way.

None of the information in this article or spreadsheet is official data from S&P Global. Consult S&P Global for official information.\n\nWe review each of the 69 Dividend Aristocrats every year. The next stock to be reviewed in this year\u2019s edition is AbbVie (ABBV).\n\nAbbVie is coming off a multi-year period of excellent growth, thanks to the massive success of its flagship product Humira. There are questions regarding the company\u2019s future growth due to increasing competition for Humira in the U.S. and Europe, but the company has a plan to continue its growth in the long run.\n\nThis article will discuss AbbVie\u2019s business model, growth potential, and valuation.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global pharmaceutical giant with a $370 billion market capitalization, making it a mega-cap stock.\n\nAbbVie began trading as an independent company in 2013 after it was spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT), a fellow pharmaceutical dividend aristocrat.\n\nAdditional Resource: Stock Spin-Off Calendar from Stock Spin-Off Investing.\n\nAbbVie is a pharmaceutical products company that is focused on a couple of key treatment areas, including immunology, oncology, and neurological health\n\nThanks to the growth it has experienced since being spun off, AbbVie now generates annual revenue of around $59 billion.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s most important product is Humira. Humira is an immunology drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and several other indications. It has been the top-selling drug in the world for a couple of years.\n\nThe challenge for AbbVie is that Humira is now facing biosimilar competition in Europe and the US (since January 2023).\n\nAbbVie reported its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results on January 31st. AbbVie reported 2024 adjusted EPS of $10.12 (down 8.9%) on $56.3B in revenue (up 3.7%). Q4 revenue grew 5.6% to $15.1B, but a GAAP loss per share of $0.02 was due to an impairment charge.\n\nSkyrizi ($11.7B) and Rinvoq ($6.0B) offset Humira\u2019s decline, while oncology (+10.8%) and neuroscience (+16.6%) saw strong growth. Aesthetics dipped slightly. AbbVie expects high single-digit growth through 2029 and raised its 2027 Skyrizi/Rinvoq sales forecast to $31B+.\n\nKey updates include EU approval for Elahere, new partnerships, and positive Parkinson\u2019s trial data. 2025 adjusted EPS is projected at $12.12\u2013$12.32.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe major risk for global pharmaceutical manufacturers is patent loss. When a particular drug loses its patent, the market is typically flooded with competition, especially for the world\u2019s top-selling products.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s biggest risk is the competition about to hit its flagship drug, Humira. This multi-purpose drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and more.\n\nHumira once generated over half of AbbVie\u2019s annual sales. The loss of patent exclusivity in the US in early 2023 is a significant overhang.\n\nGoing forward, AbbVie expects to return to growth from its expanded portfolio. The company prepared for the loss of patent exclusivity on Humira, by investing heavily in new products as well as acquisitions to boost its growth.\n\nFor example, Rinvoq and Skyrizi are two additional products that represent long-term growth catalysts.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nAbbVie\u2019s $63 billion acquisition of Allergan also remains a source of future business and earnings growth.\n\nAllergan\u2019s flagship product is Botox, which diversifies AbbVie\u2019s portfolio by exposing it to global aesthetics and neurological indications. Both of these markets continue to experience growth, thereby allowing AbbVie to benefit from growing spending in these areas.\n\nOverall, we expect 5% annual EPS growth from AbbVie over the next five years.\n\nCompetitive Advantages & Recession Performance\n\nThe most important competitive advantage for AbbVie, and any other pharmaceutical company, is its patent portfolio. Pharmaceutical giants need to spend heavily to innovate new drugs and therapies when one of their blockbusters loses patent protection.\n\nLike many of its peers, AbbVie spends billions on R&D every year. Thanks to that heavy spending on new therapies, AbbVie is well-positioned in growth markets such as oncology and immunology.\n\nThe company has a large number of new products in various stages of development.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nAbbVie was not a stand-alone company during the last financial crisis, so there is no recession track record, but since sick people require treatment whether the economy is expanding or contracting, AbbVie would likely continue to perform well during a recession.\n\nThe COVID pandemic has not negatively impacted AbbVie, as the company hit new record profits in 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\nEven if AbbVie\u2019s earnings were to decline slightly in a recession, the dividend should remain secure. AbbVie\u2019s dividend payout ratio is approximately 54% expected for 2025.\n\nValuation & Expected Returns\n\nAbbVie is expected to generate adjusted EPS of $12.22 for 2025, at the midpoint of guidance. At this EPS level, the stock is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.3. AbbVie is valued considerably below the S&P 500 Index.\n\nOur fair value estimate for AbbVie is a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.0 due to increasing leverage from the Allergan acquisition and the expired Humira patent exclusivity. These are continued overhangs on the company\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nAs a result, we view AbbVie as slightly overvalued. A compressing P/E multiple could decrease shareholder returns by approximately 5% per year over the next 5 years.\n\nIn addition, we expect annual earnings growth of 5% through the next five years. Lastly, the stock has a current dividend yield of 3.2%.\n\nIn total, we expect annual returns of around 3.2% per year over the next five years, making AbbVie stock a hold.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAbbVie is a high-quality business, with a strong pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth potential. It is also a shareholder-friendly company that returns excess cash flow to investors.\n\nThe near-term outlook is murky, as AbbVie faces a significant challenge in replacing lost Humira sales from losing patent exclusivity.\n\nWhile the company has prepared for this with heavy R&D investments, earnings-per-share growth has stalled in the past few years.\n\nWith expected returns a little above 3% per year going forward, even including the dividend yield, AbbVie stock is rated a hold right now.\n\nIf you are interested in finding high-quality dividend growth stocks suitable for long-term investment, the following Sure Dividend databases will be useful:\n\nThe major domestic stock market indices are another solid resource for finding investment ideas.

Eli Lilly also appears to be preparing, commiting $27 billion to boost its U.S. manufacturing capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, another regulatory meeting has been canceled under new HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Reuters revealed last week that an upcoming meeting of the FDA\u2019s external advisers for vaccine policy on March 13 has been canceled \u2014just a week after the CDC Vaccine Advisory Board\u2019s first meeting of 2025 was postponed . Also on the policy front, BioSpace took a deep dive into priority review vouchers (PRVs) after Congress failed to reauthorize the rare pediatric disease PRV program at the end of 2024.

            "content": "AbbVie expects to record combined Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales of more than $31 billion in 2027. Strong immunology market growth, market share gains and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years, are expected to drive these drugs\u2019 growth.\n\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq generated combined sales of $17.7 billion in 2024. The drugs are seeing strong performance across all their approved indications, especially in the popular inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) space, which includes two conditions \u2014 ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Importantly, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have demonstrated compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies in clinical studies, which have given them a competitive advantage.\n\nAbbVie lost patent protection for Humira in the United States in January 2023 and in the EU in 2018. Humira's sales are declining due to the loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well.\n\nLong-term investors, however, are not focused on one-off news like these. They focus on the company\u2019s fundamentals to understand how to play the stock.\n\nThe obesity market has gained tremendous popularity and is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030, per a Goldman Sachs report. Eli Lilly LLY and Novo Nordisk NVO currently dominate the space with their respective GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Wegovy. However, several large drugmakers like Merc k MRK, Pfizer, Amgen, and AstraZeneca, among others, are trying to get a share of the obesity space either by developing candidates in-house or buying rights to obesity candidates through licensing deals with smaller biotechs. The deal marks AbbVie\u2019s entry into the obesity space.\n\nAbbVie will lead the development of the candidate. For the deal, AbbVie will pay Gubra an upfront payment of $350 million and be entitled to make milestone payments of up to $1.875 billion to the latter.\n\nWhile the obesity field is greatly dominated by GLP-1 products, the amylin hormone is gaining steam as a potential target for treating obesity. It regulates appetite by slowing down stomach emptying, which makes a person feel full and helps prevent overeating.\n\nEarlier this week, AbbVie ABBV announced that it is in-licensing rights to develop phase I candidate, GUB014295, a long-acting amylin analog for the treatment of obesity, from Danish research company, Gubra.\n\nStory Continues\n\nABBV Boasts an Attractive Pipeline\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates with blockbuster potential. The company expects several regulatory submissions, approvals and key data readouts in the next 12 months.\n\nABBV also has an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies in blood cancers and solid tumors like ABBV-383, a BCMA CD3 bispecific (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) and Temab-A (metastatic colorectal cancer). Teliso-V, a promising c-Met ADC, is under review in the United States for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, with an approval decision expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nIn November, AbbVie gained approval for Vyalev, a transformative therapy for treating advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. Studies are also ongoing to evaluate new indications for Botox and Juvederm collection of fillers.\n\nAbbVie on an Acquisition Spree\n\nThe company has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline. It has signed several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also signing some early-stage deals in oncology and neuroscience areas. It has inked more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience. The latest deal with Gubra is a testament to this trend.\n\nABBV\u2019s Slowing Aesthetics Sales & Humira Erosion\n\nSales of AbbVie\u2019s blockbuster drug Humira are declining due to biosimilar erosion. Humira volume is rapidly eroding compared to other novel mechanisms (including Skyrizi and Rinvoq). The decline expected to be sharper in 2025 as more plans exclude branded Humira and move to exclusive biosimilar contracts.\n\nAbbVie is witnessing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China due to challenging market conditions. The slowing growth of the U.S. facial injectables market and persistent economic headwinds, which are affecting consumer spending in China, are hurting Juvederm's sales due to its higher price point. Juvederm sales declined 14.6% in 2024.\n\nABBV\u2019s global sales of aesthetics portfolio declined 0.6% in 2024. On the fourth-quarter conference call, AbbVie also lowered its guidance for its aesthetics franchise\u2019s long-term growth. It expects a high single-digit CAGR for this franchise through 2029. This guidance translates to a little more than $7 billion, much lower than the previous expectation of more than $9 billion for 2030.\n\nABBV Stock Price, Valuation and Estimate Revision\n\nAbbVie stock has gained 14.8% in the past year compared with an increase of 0.3% for the industry.\n\nABBV Stock Outperforms Industry\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AbbVie is not very cheap. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 16.52 forward earnings, just slightly lower than 17.80 for the industry. The stock is cheaper than some other large drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk but priced much higher than most other large drugmakers. The stock is also trading above its five-year mean of 11.76.\n\nABBV Stock Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.24 per share to $12.29 while that for 2026 has increased from $13.81 to $13.93 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nABBV Estimate Movement\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in ABBV Stock\n\nAbbVie faces its share of headwinds, such as Humira biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on cancer drug Imbruvica and slow market growth trends for fillers in the United States and China. It also faced some key pipeline setbacks in 2024.\n\nHowever, AbbVie has faced its biggest challenge \u2014 Humira\u2019s patent cliff \u2014 quite well and looks well-positioned for continued strong growth in the years ahead. The company saw a rapid return to sales growth in 2024 after revenues declined in 2023 due to Humira loss of exclusivity (LOE), driven by its ex-Humira platform. AbbVie\u2019s ex-Humira drugs rose around 19% (on a reported basis) in 2024, exceeding its internal expectations.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029 as it has no significant LOE event for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by robust performances from Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s rising estimates, a solid pipeline and the prospect of growth in 2025 sales and profits are good enough reasons to stay invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAbbVie is joining the industry\u2019s rush to develop new obesity medicines, announcing a deal this week with Denmark-based Gubra to license a drug that could compete with experimental therapies being developed by Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Zealand Pharma.\n\nPer deal terms, AbbVie will pay Gubra $350 million up front and offer up to $1.9 billion in additional payments tied to the achievement of development and sales milestones. AbbVie will assume responsibility for development and commercialization.\n\nGubra is developing a type of drug called an amylin analog that regulates appetite and blood sugar levels. If successful, these drugs could be used as alternatives to or in combination with marketed drugs like Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to increase weight loss or reduce side effects.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly and Novo have a significant lead on the obesity field, as they market the only two blockbuster drugs proven in testing to result in double-digit percentage weight loss. But those GLP-1 drugs have drawbacks, including side effects like nausea and vomiting in many people who take the once-weekly shots. They also have high discontinuation rates due to those side effects as well as their costs.\n\nThose shortcomings, along with the draw of a market forecast to exceed $100 billion annually by the 2030s, have energized obesity drug research and dealmaking. Even companies like AbbVie and Amgen that don\u2019t have a long track record in metabolic drugs are getting involved.\n\nAbbVie found an attractive deal with Gubra, which is developing an agent it calls GUB014295 or GUBamy. The experimental drug has completed a Phase 1 dosing trial in men considered lean or overweight by body-mass index. Trial volunteers who received the highest dose lost an average of 3% of their body weight over six weeks.\n\nAn additional dosing trial is underway, with results from various parts of that study due to be available throughout 2025.\n\nAt this stage of development, Gubra\u2019s candidate is around a year and a half behind Zealand, which has an amylin-targeting drug in a phase 2 trial due to read out in 2026, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNovo, meanwhile, already has phase 3 data on its amylin drug cagrilintide, which was assessed in a trial alone and as part of a combination with Wegovy called CagriSema. Lilly has an amylin drug in phase 2, and AstraZeneca and Metsera are developing similar agents.\n\nWhile the Gubra trial results so far suggest the drug is active, Agrawal added that it\u2019s \u201chard to know whether it\u2019s differentiated in any way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gubra developed its drug to be more stable than other amylin-targeting drugs, Agrawal wrote. Those drugs commonly undergo a chemical reaction called \u201cfibrillation\u201d that can reduce potency, raise the risk of side effects and affect quality.",

This significant development may underpin the company's 18% share price increase over the last quarter. The healthcare sector, too, has seen advances with AbbVie's EMBLAVEO\u2122 gaining FDA approval for a combination antibiotic, and the European Medicines Agency recommending its arthritis treatment, RINVOQ\u00ae. Concurrently, broader market trends reflect a more modest movement, with major indices experiencing minor fluctuations as investors navigate economic data and tariff updates. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight losses, the market's yearly upward trajectory contrasts with AbbVie's strong share performance. Additionally, the company's financial maneuvers, including major public offerings and credit expansions, underscore a bolstered financial position, possibly reinforcing investor confidence amidst these developments.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings on AbbVie.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, AbbVie's total shareholder return reached 192.95%, showcasing a strong performance. This achievement comes amidst varied developments that have shaped the company's trajectory. Notably, AbbVie's consistent dividend increases, including the $1.64 declared in February, reflect ongoing shareholder value enhancement strategies. Additionally, AbbVie completed significant share repurchases amounting to US$16.5 billion, further underscoring its commitment to returning capital to investors. This comprehensive approach has set AbbVie apart from industry peers, outperforming both the broader market and its sector over the past year.\n\nDiversified product development has also played a crucial role, with key approvals like SKYRIZI\u00ae for multiple indications in Canada and the FDA approval of EMBLAVEO\u2122 addressing critical market needs. The ongoing collaboration with REGENXBIO and other strategic partnerships have likely bolstered its R&D capabilities. Despite executive transitions and legal challenges like the Humira pricing inquiries, AbbVie's focus on research innovation and financial strategies remains a critical driver of its robust long-term returns.",

Subscribe here to receive future editions.\n\nThe booming weight loss drug market has gained a new potential competitor.\n\nAbbVie said on Monday that it will pay up to $2.2 billion to develop Danish drugmaker Gubra's experimental obesity drug, marking its late foray into the segment.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, the pharmaceutical giant will pay Gubra $350 million upfront. AbbVie will also pay up to nearly $1.9 billion if the drug meets certain development and sales milestones.\n\nGubra, which provides pre-clinical contract research and peptide-based drug discovery services, will be eligible to receive certain royalties on global net sales of the drug, called GUB014295. Shares OF Gubra closed 15% higher on Monday after the licensing agreement was announced.\n\nHere's what's important to know about the medicine: It is an injection that mimics amylin, a different gut hormone than the existing obesity drugs on the market target.\n\nAmylin activates signals to the brain that suppress appetite and reduce food intake, according to AbbVie. The hormone also slows so-called gastric emptying, or the process by which the contents of the stomach are moved into the small intestine.\n\nNovo Nordisk 's blockbuster obesity treatment Wegovy mimics a hormone called GLP-1 to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar, while Eli Lilly 's own drug Zepbound targets both GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP.\n\nA few companies, including Novo Nordisk, Zealand Pharma, AstraZeneca and Structure Therapeutics , are developing products that target amylin. Some of those drugs are further along in development than Gubra's medicine, such as Zealand's petrelintide, but it is still too early to know which one is most effective for weight loss.\n\nSome drugmakers believe that targeting amylin could reduce the gastrointestinal side effects typically seen with treatments that target GLP-1, and may lead to less muscle loss than existing drugs. But those effects have to be proven in clinical trials.\n\nIn a research note Monday, BMO analyst Evan Seigerman said \"all-in we're positive on the deal\" for AbbVie. He said the company's entrance into the obesity market could \"come with synergies\" to other areas of its business, such as inflammation and aesthetics.\n\nFor example, researchers are studying the inflammatory benefits of obesity drugs for conditions such as a serious form of liver disease, cardiovascular outcomes and Alzheimer's, among others, Seigerman wrote.\n\n\"We see an opportunity for AbbVie to leverage their expertise in this space to better understand these potential benefits,\" he added.\n\nAn obesity drug could also complement AbbVie's aesthetics business, which offers Botox, other facial injectables, skin care and body contouring, among other products, according to Seigerman.\n\nNotably, the deal comes as AbbVie looks for its next top-selling drug following the patent expiration for its mega blockbuster autoimmune medicine Humira.\n\n\"Our partnership with Gubra marks our entry into the obesity field, offering a compelling opportunity based on the potential to address patient needs while also fostering long-term growth for our company,\" AbbVie CEO Robert Michael, who took over just over six months ago, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe deal, however, could be a \"potential negative\" for Structure Therapeutics, Seigerman said.\n\nThat biotech company is still looking for potential partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies to further develop and commercialize its experimental GLP-1 and amylin products.\n\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com.",

            "content": "For six years straight, AbbVie\u2019s Humira reigned as the world\u2019s best-selling drug.\n\nThe anti-TNF antibody bowed only to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty in 2021, and yet even in the throes of the pandemic\u2014when anti-infectives saw a surge in demand\u2014Humira stood its ground, staying in the top three earners of the year.\n\nIn 2024, however, it became clear that Humira is no longer the dominant market force that it once was. Mounting biosimilar and competitive pressure have sent Humira\u2019s sales steadily downward. The drug is no longer AbbVie\u2019s biggest moneymaker and the pharma appears to no longer be investing in its growth. As per its latest pipeline update document, posted in January, AbbVie has no active studies or applications for Humira.\n\nHumira\u2019s fall is emblematic of the typical life cycle of drugs. John Gagliano, senior director at BioPharmCatalyst, expects to see a similar pattern play out in the coming years, as the industry faces the strongest patent headwinds in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cThe overall landscape [of top drugs] is anticipated to become more diverse as emerging therapies gradually replace aging blockbusters,\u201d he told BioSpace in an email. Companies can implement what Gagliano calls \u201cdefensive strategies\u201d such as novel formulations, patent extensions and combination regimens to prolong the exclusivity of their drugs and \u201csustain their positions\u201d in the market\u2014but that only serves to delay the inevitable.\n\n\u201cMany current top sellers face imminent loss of exclusivity (LOE), which will likely trigger rapid revenue declines,\u201d Gagliano continued.\n\nIn addition to Humira, Eliquis and Opdivo are likely to \u201cdrop out of the top ranks as biosimilars and generics enter the market,\u201d predicts Gagliano\u2019s colleague Olivia Tidwell, content coordinator at BioPharmCatalyst. Meanwhile, she continued, potentially rising to take their place are promising assets in emerging modalities, such as radioligand therapies, CAR Ts and gene therapies, among others.\n\nHere, BioSpace looks at the top 10 pharma products that brought in the biggest sales in 2024. The list is a mix of predictable and surprising. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic, for instance, was pretty much a shoo-in for this list, while several drugs facing LOE concerns\u2014and were therefore expected to suffer slower sales\u2014managed to maintain their market dominance.\n\nMerck\u2019s Keytruda Tops Again\u2014But for How Long?\n\n2024 Sales: $29.5 billion\n\nYOY Change: 18%\n\nFor the second year in a row, Merck\u2019s blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda tops the list of pharma\u2019s best-selling products. In 2024, Keytruda surged 18% year-on-year to hit $29.48 billion in sales.\n\nThe feat comes as no surprise given how Keytruda has become a cornerstone cancer therapy with more than 40 indications under its belt, including various forms of lung and gynecological cancers. Most recently, the FDA approved Keytruda for the first-line treatment of pleural mesothelioma, giving Merck access to a market that could exceed $12 billion in value by 2034, as per an August 2024 IMARC report.\n\nBut trouble could be brewing on Keytruda\u2019s horizon. Key patents protecting Merck\u2019s blockbuster are set to expire in 2028, opening it up to biosimilar competition and, in turn, eroding sales. There also appears to be growing regulatory apprehension regarding the widespread use of Keytruda\u2014and PD-1 inhibitors more broadly.\n\nIn September 2024, an FDA advisory panel overwhelmingly voted to narrow the label of Keytruda, along with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo and Yervoy, in stomach and esophageal cancers, restricting their use in patients with low PD-1 expression levels. The FDA has yet to put out a formal directive.\n\nMerck is doing what it can to maintain Keytruda\u2019s market dominance. The pharma is developing a subcutaneous formulation of the PD-1 blocker that could help maintain an edge over potential copycats.\n\n\u201cUnlike Humira\u2019s steep post-LOE slide, Keytruda\u2019s lifecycle management measures suggest it will retain significant market share, albeit potentially at a lower rank,\u201d BioPharmCatalyst analyst Cristian Marulanda told BioSpace in an email. \u201cMerck\u2019s proactive strategies and continuous innovation may help Keytruda weather competitive pressures better than past examples.\u201d\n\nIRA Threatens Rise of Novo\u2019s Ozempic\n\n2024 Sales: $16.9 billion\n\nYOY Change: 26%\n\nIt comes as a surprise to no one that the widely popular type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic is among the top-performing drugs of 2024. In its full-year business report, Novo Nordisk revealed that the GLP-1 therapy made more than 120 billion Danish kroner last year, or approximately $16.9 billion.\n\nOzempic was one of the highest-growth assets on this list\u2014relative to 2023, Ozempic\u2019s sales jumped 26%\u2014and it is poised to see an even greater upward trend in coming years. Originally approved in 2017 to improve glycemic control, Ozempic secured additional approvals in 2020 to reduce cardiovascular risk and in January 2025 to lower the likelihood of chronic kidney disease.\n\nGetting in the way of Ozempic\u2019s growth, however, is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Earlier this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) selected the GLP-1 drug\u2014alongside sister brand Rybelsus\u2014for the second round of drug price negotiations. The move was not entirely unexpected. Over the past year, Novo was on the receiving end of several high-profile calls to lower the list price of Ozempic.\n\nFaced with the prospects of a price cap on Ozempic, Novo has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to speed up proceedings regarding its ongoing complaint against the IRA. Novo alleges that the price negotiations are in violation of its constitutional rights\u2014an argument that has so far failed to convince judges.\n\nBiktarvy Sales Symbolize Gilead\u2019s Strong Standing\n\n2024 Sales: $13.4 billion\n\nYOY Change: 13%\n\nBuilding off the size of the HIV market is Gilead\u2019s antiretroviral drug Biktarvy, which in 2024 jumped 13% to bring in $13.42 billion in sales, growth that the pharma attributed to \u201chigher demand\u201d for the drug.\n\nBiktarvy is currently the cornerstone of Gilead\u2019s HIV business. It \u201ccommands over 50% share of the U.S. market\u201d and is the \u201cregimen of choice\u201d across many markets, commercial chief Johanna Mercier said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter investor call.\n\nUnlike Keytruda and Ozempic, there are no clear headwinds in Biktarvy\u2019s immediate future. Key patent protections for the drug will remain intact in the coming years and will keep generic competitors off the market until 2033. Biktarvy also escaped the CMS\u2019s list for the second cycle of drug negotiations.\n\nStill, Biktarvy isn\u2019t a completely risk-free asset for Gilead, and the prospects of price control problems remain on the horizon. In a note to investors in February 2025, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said that they are wary of the drug\u2019s \u201clikely inclusion\u201d in the 2028 cycle of IRA negotiations.\n\nBMS, Pfizer Brace for Eliquis LOE\n\n2024 Sales: $13.3 billion\n\nYOY Change: 9%\n\nThe blood thinner Eliquis\u2014developed and commercialized through the powerhouse partnership between Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer\u2014made $13.3 billion in 2024, representing a 9% year-on-year increase in sales.\n\nThe drug has long been a prized asset for both companies, but that may soon be coming to an end. Eliquis is set to lose market exclusivity in 2026\u2014with several generics already lined up, eager to enter the U.S. market and eat into the drug\u2019s earnings. Among these are copycats from Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Micro Labs Limited, which the FDA approved as early December 2019.\n\nEliquis was also in the first batch of drugs that underwent the CMS drug price negotiations last year. The final maximum fair price of $231 for a 30-day supply, set to take effect in 2026, is a 56% discount from the original cost, though it was already selling below list price.\n\nTo cope with the potential loss of revenue from Eliquis, BMS has kicked a multibillion-dollar savings initiative into motion, targeting $1.5 billion in cost-cuts by the end of 2025 and another $2 billion through 2027. Pfizer is taking a similar approach, setting a $3.5 billion savings goal in 2024 and tacking on another $1.5 billion by the end of 2027.\n\nSanofi, Regeneron Rely on Robust Dupixent Figures\n\n2024 Sales: $13 billion\n\nYOY Change: 23%\n\nSanofi and Regeneron are jointly commercializing the immunology heavy-hitter Dupixent, which last year bagged $13.072 billion, representing 23% year-on-year growth.\n\nLike Biktarvy, Dupixent appears to have no patent- and IRA-related issues on its horizon. The drug will retain market exclusivity until 2031 and is looking at promising market prospects, too. The FDA in September 2024 approved Dupixent for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for which launch is expected this year.\n\nStill, analysts at William Blair in a January 2025 report cautioned that Regeneron and Sanofi are \u201cextremely reliant on Dupixent,\u201d with \u201clittle else to be excited about\u201d in their pipelines. Regeneron, for instance, has been trying to get its high-dose Eylea brand off the ground with limited success so far. In the fourth quarter, Eylea HD brought in $305 million, below the projected $336 million consensus.\n\nSanofi, meanwhile, is a \u201cbit of a one-trick pony with respect to near-term growth drivers,\u201d according to the William Blair report. Vaccines account for around 15% of its revenue and this space faces considerable exposure due to volatility linked to changes in government policies, the firm wrote.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s Skyrocketing Skyrizi\n\n2024 Sales: $11.7 billion\n\nYOY Change: 50.9%\n\nAbbVie\u2019s answer to Humira\u2019s fall, the anti-IL-23 therapy Skyrizi, is the fastest-growing asset on this list. With a 50.9% year-on-year increase in sales, Skyrizi raked in $11.718 billion for the Illinois pharma in 2024, easily surpassing Humira\u2019s nearly $9 billion earnings.\n\nThat Skyrizi finds itself on this list is evidence of how well AbbVie handled the lapsed protections for Humira, which for years was the world\u2019s top-selling drug. In the third quarter of 2024, sales of Skyrizi\u2014alongside the JAK inhibitor Rinvoq\u2014helped AbbVie narrowly beat analysts\u2019 expectations, despite continued erosion of Humira\u2019s sales.\n\nThis trend continued into the fourth quarter. In a Feb. 1 note from BMO Capital Markets, in reaction to the pharma\u2019s full-year business report, analysts said that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are set to \u201cusher in a new era of growth\u201d for AbbVie, which has \u201cfinally fully moved on from the narrative of the Humira LOE.\u201d\n\nSkyrizi\u2019s immediate future is clear of patent concerns. Market exclusivity is set to last until 2031, as per the January William Blair report. Likewise, Rinvoq\u2019s protections will remain intact into 2033.\n\nJ&J Offsets Stelara Losses With Darzalex Growth\n\n\n\nDarzalex\n\n2024 Sales: $11.6 billion\n\nYOY Change: 20% Stelara\n\n2024 Sales: $10.4 billion\n\nYOY Change: -4.6%\n\nJ&J had two top-selling drugs in 2024: one on its way in, the other on its way out.\n\nStelara, an anti-IL-12 and IL-23 antibody indicated for various inflammatory diseases, lost key patent protections in September 2023. Biosimilars have since entered the U.S market and, while not yet completely unseating Stelara, have eroded its sales. In 2023, the biologic made $10.86 billion. Last year, sales were down 4.6% to $10.34 billion.\n\nTo make up for lost revenue, J&J is leaning on its cancer drug Darzalex, an anti-CD38 cytolytic antibody approved for multiple myeloma. In 2024, Darzalex brought in $11.67 billion, representing nearly 20% year-on-year growth. According to the William Blair report, Darzalex will help drive J&J\u2019s cancer franchise\u2014including its CAR T therapy Carvykti and bispecific antibodies Tecvayli and Talvey\u2014to 15.3% compounded annual growth, hitting $27.1 billion in sales by 2029.\n\nJ&J continues to work on expanding Darzalex\u2019s label, including a September 2024 FDA filing that would allow the drug\u2019s use in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation, as well as a November 2024 submission for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. Darzalex will retain key patent protections until 2029, as per William Blair.\n\nHumira: On its Way Out?\n\n2024 Sales: $9 billion\n\nYoY Change: -37.6%\n\nSustaining a 37.6% year-on-year decline in sales, Humira is now clearly beyond its prime. In 2024, the once-dominant anti-inflammatory therapy brought in $8.993 billion for AbbVie.\n\nThe obvious culprit for Humira\u2019s fall from grace is growing biosimilar competition. Since the drug lost key patent protections in 2023, several copycats have hit the market, including Amgen\u2019s Amjevita, Celltrion\u2019s Yuflyma, Cordavis and Sandoz\u2019s Hyrimoz and Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s Cyltezo. Another major driver of Humira\u2019s market erosion is CVS Caremark\u2019s move in April 2024 to remove the branded drug from its major national formularies in favor of biosimilars, including its own adalimumab brand Hyrimoz. Cordavis is a CVS Caremark subsidiary launched in August 2023.\n\nHumira is putting up a commendable fight, though. In the first-quarter 2025 edition of Samsung Bioepis\u2019 Biosimilar Market Dynamics report, Humira remains the top adalimumab brand, controlling 72% of the market. In the third-quarter 2024 edition of the same report, Humira still had 82% market share.\n\nMerck\u2019s Gardasil Hangs On Amid Controversy\n\n2024 Sales: $8.6 billion\n\nYoY Change: -3%\n\nThe only vaccine on this list, Merck\u2019s human papillomavirus shot Gardasil saw a 3% drop in sales in 2024, bringing in $8.58 billion.\n\nThe jab\u2019s prospects don\u2019t look good. Key patent protections are set to expire in 2028, according to William Blair, though there appear to be no notable biosimilars on the horizon. More importantly for Merck and Gardasil are questions surrounding how U.S. health authorities will handle vaccines moving forward with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2014a known vaccine critic\u2014as Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn addition, last month, Merck announced that Gardasil shipments to China would be suspended amid stubbornly high inventories of the vaccine, a result that CEO Rob Davis blamed on \u201cincreased pressure on discretionary consumer spending\u201d on the pharma\u2019s most recent earnings call. Gardasil was recently approved for males in China.",

Additionally, AbbVie announced a leadership change with CEO Robert A. Michael being appointed as chairman, succeeding Richard A. Gonzalez. The European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use also recommended the approval of upadacitinib for treating GCA, which could make it the first oral advanced therapy for this condition.

Michael, chief executive officer, AbbVie. \"Our partnership with Gubra marks our entry into the obesity field, offering a compelling opportunity based on the potential to address patient needs while also fostering long-term growth for our company.\"\n\nGUB014295 is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial. A potential long-acting amylin analog, GUB014295 is an agonist that specifically activates amylin and calcitonin receptors. Amylin, a satiety hormone, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity given its role in activating signals to the brain that result in appetite suppression and the reduction of food intake, while also acting as an inhibitory signal to delay gastric emptying.\n\n\"Obesity represents a significant global health concern with nearly 900 million adults with obesity, many of whom struggle to stay on current treatment options,\" said Roopal Thakkar, M.D., executive vice president, research & development, chief scientific officer, AbbVie. \"Building on Gubra's experience in the discovery of novel peptide-based therapeutics, we look forward to advancing the development of the GUB014295 program.\"\n\n\"We are excited to partner with AbbVie given its strong capabilities in both the development and commercialization of life-changing medicines,\" said Henrik Blou, chief executive officer, Gubra. \"This collaboration between Gubra and AbbVie will accelerate the development of GUB014295 and build on the promising data shown in its Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) trial. Our team has been extremely impressed with AbbVie and their commitment to bring this important partnership to life. We look forward to working together throughout the development of the GUB014295 program.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities of GUB014295 globally. Gubra will receive $350 million in total upfront payment and will be eligible to receive up to $1.875 billion in development, commercial and sales milestone payments with tiered royalties on global net sales.

            "content": "AbbVie on Monday jumped into the hot weight-loss space, looking to gain ground on its Big Pharma peers, with a licensing deal with Danish company Gubra that aims to bring a long-acting amylin drug to the market.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, AbbVie will front $350 million and put up to $1.875 billion on the line for development, commercial and sales milestones. Gubra, a service provider for pre-clinical research and peptide-based drug discovery, will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales of GUB014295, the asset at the center of Monday\u2019s partnership.\n\nDesigned to be administered via an injection under the skin, GUB014295 is a long-acting analog of the amylin hormone, which acts on corresponding receptors to elicit feelings of satiety and suppress appetite, in turn lowering the overall intake of food. Amylin agonists such as GUB014295 also exert an inhibitory effect on the gastrointestinal system, helping to slow the emptying of the stomach, according to AbbVie\u2019s press announcement.\n\nThe current obesity landscape is dominated by GLP-1 medicines like Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide brands Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide franchise of Mounjaro and Zepbound. But recently, more and more companies have been looking to amylin agents as an alternative weight-loss treatment.\n\nAccording to a December 2024 note from Leerink Partners, which called amylin the \u201chottest new mechanism for obesity,\u201d targeting this pathway could potentially improve the quality of weight loss, with greater reductions in fat instead of lean muscle. Amylin agonists could also be safer and more tolerable than GLP-1 drugs, the analysts said.\n\nAt the forefront of the amylin push is Novo, which is advancing CagriSema, a combo regimen of its semaglutide, with the long-acting amylin drug cagrilintide. Late last year, however, the pharma unveiled Phase III data for CagriSema, baring an efficacy estimate that fell below its own prior projections and sending its shares crashing 20%. The readout wiped some $72 billion off Novo\u2019s market cap.\n\nFellow obesity leader Eli Lilly is also working on its own set of amylin programs, of which the mid-stage eloralintide is closest to the market. The pharma is testing a combination of the amylin drug eloralintide with tirzepatide in participants with obesity but without diabetes, for which data is expected in mid-2025. Eloralintide is also being assessed in patients with obesity and overweight with type 2 diabetes.\n\nSeveral other biopharma players are advancing their own amylin hopefuls, including Zealand Pharma and AstraZeneca.",

AbbVie will assume responsibility for development and commercialization.\n\nGubra is developing a type of drug called an amylin analog that regulates appetite and blood sugar levels. If successful, these drugs could be used as alternatives to or in combination with marketed drugs like Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to increase weight loss or reduce side effects.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly and Novo have a significant lead on the obesity field, as they market the only two blockbuster drugs proven in testing to result in double-digit percentage weight loss. But those GLP-1 drugs have drawbacks, including side effects like nausea and vomiting in many people who take the once-weekly shots. They also have high discontinuation rates due to those side effects as well as their costs.\n\nThose shortcomings, along with the draw of a market forecast to exceed $100 billion annually by the 2030s, have energized obesity drug research and dealmaking. Even companies like AbbVie and Amgen that don\u2019t have a long track record in metabolic drugs are getting involved.\n\nAbbVie found an attractive deal with Gubra, which is developing an agent it calls GUB014295 or GUBamy. The experimental drug has completed a Phase 1 dosing trial in men considered lean or overweight by body-mass index. Trial volunteers who received the highest dose lost an average of 3% of their body weight over six weeks.\n\nAn additional dosing trial is underway, with results from various parts of that study due to be available throughout 2025.\n\nAt this stage of development, Gubra\u2019s candidate is around a year and a half behind Zealand, which has an amylin-targeting drug in a Phase 2 trial due to read out in 2026, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNovo, meanwhile, already has Phase 3 data on its amylin drug cagrilintide, which was assessed in a trial alone and as part of a combination with Wegovy called CagriSema. Lilly has an amylin drug in Phase 2, and AstraZeneca and Metsera are developing similar agents.\n\nWhile the Gubra trial results so far suggest the drug is active, Agrawal added that it\u2019s \u201chard to know whether it\u2019s differentiated in any way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gubra developed its drug to be more stable than other amylin-targeting drugs, Agrawal wrote. Those drugs commonly undergo a chemical reaction called \u201cfibrillation\u201d that can reduce potency, raise the risk of side effects and affect quality.",

Credit: Deepak Verma via Getty Images.\n\nAbbVie is entering the obesity treatment market with a $2.3bn licensing agreement to acquire global rights to GUB014295, a long-acting amylin analogue developed by Danish biotech Gubra.\n\nAnnounced on 3 March, the deal marks AbbVie\u2019s first move into the increasingly competitive sector. Under the agreement, AbbVie will pay Gubra $350m upfront, with additional milestone payments of up to $1.875bn. Gubra is also eligible for tiered royalties on future sales. Following the announcement, Gubra\u2019s stock rose 24% at market open on 3 March.\n\nGUB014295 is an amylin receptor agonist that also targets calcitonin receptors. Amylin analogues have been investigated for their role in appetite suppression and delayed gastric emptying, both of which contribute to weight loss.\n\nIn a Phase I study (NCT06144684) conducted by Gubra, healthy and overweight male participants who received 3.5mg to 6mg of GUB014295 experienced an average weight loss of approximately 3% over six weeks, compared to a 1% weight gain in the placebo group. The asset is currently in the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the Phase I trial.\n\nThe obesity treatment market has become a focal point for major pharmaceutical companies, with amylin analogues emerging as a potential alternative or complement to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) such as semaglutide, marketed in obesity as Wegovy.\n\nHowever, the path for amylin-based therapies has been mixed. Novo Nordisk\u2019s amylin/GLP-1 combination therapy, CagriSema (semaglutide/cagrilintide), recently met its primary endpoint in the Phase III REDEFINE 1 trial (NCT05669755) but failed to achieve the company\u2019s target of 25% weight loss, leading to a muted investor response.\n\nUnlike GLP-1RAs, which stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon levels, amylin analogues work by suppressing glucagon secretion, increasing satiety, and delaying gastric emptying. Denmark-based Zealand Pharma is developing its own amylin analogue, petrelintide, as a potential best-in-class therapy for obesity and diabetes.\n\nGubra has been actively involved in obesity research, previously collaborating with Boehringer Ingelheim on multiple programmes. In 2021, the two companies signed a deal to co-develop four obesity candidates, but Boehringer later discontinued the development of BI 1820237, a long-acting NPY2 agonist, without providing details. One of their remaining assets, BI 3034701, a long-acting triple agonist peptide, entered a Phase I trial in July 2024. Separately, Gubra also signed a discovery deal with Amylyx for a long-acting GLP-1RA.\n\nAbbVie has been one of the last major pharmaceutical companies to enter the obesity treatment market, which has become a key area of interest for drugmakers following the commercial success of GLP-1RAs such as Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (tirzepatide). According to a recently published report, GlobalData estimates that the obesity market will exceed $173.5bn by 2031 in the seven major markets (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK and the US).\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.",

GIPR is another common obesity target, while calcitonin regulates calcium levels.\n\nStructure Therapeutics (GPCR) also has an amylin drug in testing.\n\nMore Tolerable Approach?\n\nAbbVie could develop Gubra's drug as a single drug for obesity, which could provide a more tolerable experience with moderate weight loss. This would likely be best in patients who don't respond to Lilly's and Novo's current drugs. Or, it could be used in combination with GLP-1 and GIPR drugs to drive greater weight loss, Phipps said.\n\nIn the Phase 1 study, 83% of patients who received the highest dose of Gubra's weight-loss drug had nausea and 17% experienced vomiting.\n\nLike weight-loss leaders Wegovy and Zepbound, GUB014295 is a once-weekly under-the-skin shot.\n\nPhipps and Leerink's Risinger both rate AbbVie stock an outperform.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nTempus AI Reverses 192% Run.

            "content": "Pharmaceutical Stocks Surge As Investors Shift Focus From AI A shift toward pharmaceuticals provides stability amid economic uncertainty, leading to gains above 10% this year.\n\nInvestors are turning their attention from the previously booming field of artificial intelligence (AI) stock to pharmaceuticals, searching for stability and growth potential during uncertain economic times. After two years of stagnation, pharmaceutical stocks are regaining their status as safe havens amid falling AI stock prices.\n\nLast week, even Nvidia, once the poster child for the AI revolution, saw its stock drop after several sessions of soaring profits. This downward trend prompted investors to look toward established pharmaceutical companies, benefiting from reasonable stock prices and strong growth prospects, especially during this economically turbulent period.\n\nTraver Davis, healthcare strategist at Citi, noted, \"Investors today are changing how they perceive risk. With rising recession fears and inflation alarm bells ringing from the policies of former President Donald Trump, investors are understandably gravitating toward stable companies with consistent profits, high dividends, and reasonable stock valuations.\" Currently, the forecasted P/E ratio for the healthcare sector within the S&P 500 hovers around 18, marking it as the third-lowest among all sectors, trailing only behind finance and energy.\n\nDespite some pharmaceutical stocks seeing significant gains, there are still ample opportunities for value investors. For example, giants like Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie are reporting steady increases even as broader market conditions remain shaky. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index has surged by 10% since the start of the year, standing out compared to the S&P 500, which has remained relatively flat.\n\nHistorically, the pharmaceutical sector faced challenges, particularly from low growth expectations and political risks such as pricing reforms initiated under the Inflation Reduction Act enacted by former President Joe Biden, which permitted Medicare to negotiate prices for the biggest-selling drugs. By late 2024, stock sell-offs within this sector intensified as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his skepticism about the healthcare industry, was appointed as Secretary of Health by Trump.\n\nDespite these concerns, investors now view the healthcare sector as attractively priced. Analysts assert, \"The recent reforms have not proven to be the biggest threat anymore; macro risks, like the potential for trade wars, are more pressing.\" This sentiment has led many to reinterpret political risks as tolerable under current market valuations.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, caution is advised when it concerns vaccine stocks, particularly with Moderna, whose shares have plummeted 25% since the start of the year due to fears surrounding vaccine skepticism fed by Kennedy's policy positions. Meanwhile, even with pending lawsuits surrounding its baby powder products, Johnson & Johnson's stock has increased by 13% this year, showcasing resilience.\n\nA notable turnaround is also visible among companies once seen as struggling. Gilead\u2019s stock has soared by 21% this year and 53% over the past 12 months. CVS and Walgreens are riding high, climbing 44% and 20%, respectively, fueled by improved profit outlooks and anticipations around mergers.\n\nYet, not all companies within the pharmaceutical sphere benefit equally. Traver Davis's research indicates investors are now prioritizing firms with reliable growth and low short-term patent risks. Companies like Gilead, Vertex, and Eli Lilly are outpacing others, having released innovative products without suffering significant patent expirations. On the contrary, firms such as Merck, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Regeneron are struggling due to looming patent expirations.\n\nIf the market transition from growth stocks to value stocks pushes forward, those less positioned companies may find new opportunities for recovery, especially with a firm footing built on stable revenues.\n\nThis transformation poses multiple risks for investments, emphasizing the fact there\u2019s no need for investors to chase the AI bandwagon when opportunities lie within the established pharmaceutical industry. Following these seismic shifts, many investors might find rewarding avenues to explore within this sector.\n\nLooking forward to the immediate future of the Vietnamese stock market, which has also enjoyed stable growth, VN-Index managed to achieve its fifth consecutive week of gains, adding 8.61 points (about 0.66%) this past week. This trend emboldens investors who are increasingly confident as trading volumes improve, even as global markets experience volatility.\n\nNguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb B\u00edch Tuy\u1ec1n, market analyst at Vietcap Securities, noted, \"The market is maintaining momentum above the upper support channel, indicating increased confidence among investors. Should the VN-Index surpass the 1,315-point threshold, we could aim for 1,350 points next.\" Factors like rising commodity prices and government commitment to developing affordable housing for low-income individuals bolster the optimism.\n\nYet caution persists among investors, as highlighted by Nguy\u1ec5n Vi\u1ec7t Quang, director of Yuanta Securities, who hesitates on new purchases until the 1,300-point level is confirmed as new support. If fluctuations occur, investors anticipate swift recovery without significant losses. Davis concludes, \"2025 is set to be promising, but the market\u2019s resilience will need to translate these improvements practically for all stocks.\" Investors may be shifting focus, but wise allocation can yield fruitful investments across sectors, particularly pharmaceuticals amid this steady economic climate.",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other psychedelic stocks.\n\nThe Therapeutic Potential and Investment Boom in Psychedelic Medicine\n\nIn contrast to drugs like cocaine or marijuana, psychedelics are strong and give users access to a kind of \"alternate reality.\" One class of hallucinogenic substances that can produce unusual states of consciousness is psychedelics. LSD and chemicals originating from plants are among the many chemical substances included in this class. Psychedelics have the power to change or heighten feelings, thoughts, and energy levels, which frequently leads to spiritual experiences. They are divided into two primary categories: serotonergic chemicals (like LSD) and empathogens and dissociative drugs (like PCP). These medications are being investigated for therapeutic uses in addition to recreational ones, and they have shown promise in the treatment of several illnesses, including opiate addiction, severe depressive disorders, treatment-resistant depression, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe revival of interest in psychedelics has been greatly aided by venture capital investors. Startups in this sector saw a spike in investor interest around the beginning of 2020, which was dubbed the \"psychedelic renaissance.\" On February 16, 2023, Clara Burtenshaw, a partner at Neo Kuma Ventures, the biggest European venture capital fund specializing in psychedelic investments, shared her excitement about psychedelic healthcare, saying:\n\n\u201cPsychedelic healthcare is a very exciting area because it\u2019s this apex of drugs, clinics, and experimental treatments.\u201d\n\nGrowth and Promise of the Psychedelic Drugs Market\n\nMany psychedelic-focused pharmaceutical businesses are working to have their medications approved by the government. Psilocybin and other hallucinogens are showing great promise in treating disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The US psychedelic drugs market is projected to grow from $4.51 billion in 2025 to $15.62 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 16.8%. This growth is part of a larger global trend, with the worldwide market expected to reach $11.93 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 16.9%.\n\nPsilocybin (magic mushrooms) is the most widely used psychedelic drug in the United States, with an estimated 8 million American adults using it in 2023, according to a survey conducted by RAND Corporation. Around 12% of respondents reported lifetime use, and 3.1% used it in the past year. LSD use has also risen significantly, particularly among individuals aged 18-25, with usage increasing from 0.9% in 2002 to 4% in 2019. The LSD market is projected to grow from $145.9 million in 2024 to $265.7 million by 2034. MDMA, although not providing specific usage data, remains popular, especially in research for PTSD treatment. Ketamine has gained attention for its depression treatment potential, particularly with the FDA approval of Spravato nasal spray.",

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion on upadacitinib (RINVOQ) for treating giant cell arteritis (GCA), an autoimmune disease that can lead to blindness and stroke. If the European Commission follows suit in the first half of 2025, upadacitinib would become the first and only oral advanced therapy for GCAa huge win for AbbVie as it looks to expand its immunology dominance.\n\nThe CHMP's endorsement comes off the back of AbbVie's Phase 3 SELECT-GCA trial, which showed that upadacitinib not only helps patients achieve sustained remission but also reduces dependence on steroidsa big deal in GCA treatment. AbbVie has been aggressively pushing its immunology pipeline as Humira faces increasing biosimilar competition, and this latest development could be a key driver of future growth. Investors are eyeing this closely, as RINVOQ's expansion into new indications strengthens its potential as a multi-billion-dollar franchise.\n\nWith the immunology space heating up and competition fierce, AbbVie's ability to secure regulatory wins in new areas will be critical for its long-term trajectory. The European Commission's final decision will be the moment of truth. A green light would not only boost AbbVie's revenue potential but also solidify its standing in the high-stakes biopharma race. Investors betting on AbbVie's next leg of growth will be watching this one closely.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Additional positive sentiment may have stemmed from the recent FDA approval of EMBLAVEO\u2122, marking another significant milestone for the company. Meanwhile, broader market trends showed volatility, with major indexes like the Nasdaq down 5.5% in February amid economic concerns and uncertainty over tariff policies. Yet, despite a challenging market backdrop and a mixed earnings report showing a slight net loss for the quarter, AbbVie's strategic advancements in their product portfolio appeared to bolster investor sentiment, contributing to this substantial price appreciation over the month.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nOver the past five years, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) has achieved a total shareholder return of 179.26%. This impressive performance included key events such as FDA approvals and significant regulatory achievements bolstering long-term investor confidence. The strategic alliance with AbCellera to enhance T-cell engager technology in oncology, announced in January 2025, highlighted AbbVie's commitment to innovation. The expansion of the product portfolio with successful trials and approvals, such as the 2022 approval of SKYRIZI for psoriatic arthritis in Canada, further reinforced the company's growth trajectory.\n\nRecent executive leadership changes with Robert A. Michael set to take over as CEO and Chairman from July 2025 reflect a pivot towards sustaining long-term growth. The extensive share buyback activity, completing over 152 million shares since 2018, illustrated effective capital allocation strategies that might have supported the stock's performance. Additionally, AbbVie outperformed the US market and Biotech industry over the past year, demonstrating resilience amid challenges posed by earnings variability and market volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 5.1%.\n\nIs there a buying opportunity in AbbVie, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free.\n\nWe don't have much confidence in AbbVie. Here are three reasons why we avoid ABBV and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Is AbbVie Not Exciting?\n\nFounded in 2013 as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and sells prescription medicines focused on areas like immunology (arthritis, for example), oncology (cancers), and neuroscience (depression, for example).\n\n1. Constant Currency Revenue Hits a Standstill\n\nWe can better understand Therapeutics companies by analyzing their constant currency revenue. This metric excludes currency movements, which are outside of AbbVie\u2019s control and are not indicative of underlying demand.\n\nOver the last two years, AbbVie failed to grow its constant currency revenue. This performance was underwhelming and implies there may be increasing competition or market saturation. It also suggests AbbVie might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability.\n\n2. Shrinking Adjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, AbbVie\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 10.6 percentage points over the last two years. This raises an eyebrow about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Its adjusted operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 41.4%.\n\n3. EPS Barely Growing\n\nAnalyzing the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable \u2013 for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s unimpressive 2.4% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nAbbVie isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. That said, the stock currently trades at 16.7\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $205.51 per share). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now. Let us point you toward an all-weather company that owns household favorite Taco Bell.\n\nStocks We Would Buy Instead of AbbVie\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks.

(\u201cMustang\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: MBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today\u2019s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers, today announced the exit of the lease for its manufacturing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts and concurrent divestment of certain fixed assets including furniture and equipment to AbbVie Bioresearch Center Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cAbbVie\u201d), for $1.0 million .\n\nMustang has relocated its corporate headquarters to 95 Sawyer Road, Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nMustang expects to continue to rely on its academic partners and future contract manufacturing relationships to support clinical trials. As a result of the termination of its lease, the Company expects savings of approximately $2.0 million of cash expenses related to the lease over the next 24 months.\n\nThe Company remains focused on advancing its existing portfolio and anticipates supporting and initiating a novel clinical trial with MB-109, a combination therapy of MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus) and MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12\u2010targeted CAR-T cell therapy) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (\u201cGBM\u201d) and high-grade astrocytomas in the second half of 2025.\n\nAbout MB-109 (MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12 targeted CAR-T cells) + MB-108 oncolytic virus)\n\nMB-109 is Mustang\u2019s designation for the treatment regimen combining MB-101 (IL13R\u03b12\u2010targeted CAR-T cell therapy licensed from City of Hope) with MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus licensed from Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital). The combination is designed to leverage MB-108 to make immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors \u201chot\u201d and potentially improve the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. MB-108 oncolytic virus is first injected to infect tumor cells which, in turn, leads to reshaping of the tumor microenvironment (\u201cTME\u201d) through recruitment of endogenous CD8- and CD3-positive effector T-cells. This inflamed TME potentially permits MB-101 CAR-T cells injected into and around the tumor to better infiltrate into and throughout the tumor mass, undergo activation and, ideally, effect tumor cell killing.\n\nAbout Mustang Bio\n\nMustang Bio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today\u2019s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers. Mustang aims to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest, to fund research and development, and to outlicense or bring the technologies to market. Mustang has partnered with top medical institutions to advance the development of CAR-T therapies.

            "content": "Dividend stocks provide a stable and predictable source of income, especially in a volatile market. Dividend Kings, in particular, are frequently considered superior to stocks with high dividend yields, which most investors find appealing.\n\nThese companies have not only paid consistent dividends, but also increased them consecutively for at least 50 years, demonstrating resilience in a variety of economic conditions. Most passive income investors favor them because of their consistent and growing payouts. Companies earning this title typically have strong balance sheets, consistent cash flow, and long-term business models that allow them to pay and increase dividends.\n\nHere are three such Dividend Kings to include in your portfolio for reliable income.\n\nDividend King #1: Emerson Electric\n\nEstablished in 1890, Emerson Electric (EMR) is a global industrial technology and automation company. It offers industrial automation, process control, and software solutions to industries including oil and gas, chemicals, power, and manufacturing. It also provides commercial and residential solutions for heating, cooling, and food preservation in homes and commercial buildings. For the past 68 years, Emerson has been a top Dividend King, consistently paying and increasing dividends.\n\nValued at $67.6 billion, EMR stock has fallen 3.3% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gain of 1.8%\n\nEmerson\u2019s earnings have grown steadily, thanks to strong cash flow generation. In the most recent first quarter of fiscal 2025, adjusted earnings increased by 13% to $1.38 per share. In addition, the company generated $694 million in free cash flow, up from $367 million the previous year, and paid out $300 million in dividends. The company intends to generate $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025 and return $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nEmerson has a forward dividend yield of 1.76% and a forward payout ratio of 32.4%, which suggests that current dividend payments are sustainable, with ample room for dividend growth. Emerson\u2019s growth strategy entails strategic acquisitions and divestitures to strengthen its focus on automation and software solutions. Notably, the company proposed acquiring the remaining shares of Aspen Technology in order to strengthen its industrial software capabilities. Analysts predict that Emerson\u2019s earnings will increase by 8.4% in fiscal 2025, and another 9.1% in fiscal 2026.\n\nOverall, Wall Street rates Emerson stock as a \"Moderate Buy.\u201d Of the 23 analysts covering EMR, 16 have rated it a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one suggests a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d five rate it a \u201cHold,\u201d and one says it is a \u201cModerate Sell.\u201d The mean target price is $143, which is 20% above current levels. Its high target price of $160 implies potential upside of 33% over the next 12 months.\n\nDividend King #2: Abbvie\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) is a global biotech company that develops and markets innovative medicines in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and other areas. While Abbvie is best known for its blockbuster immunology drug Humira, its upcoming patent expiration has raised investor concerns. However, the company\u2019s aggressive portfolio diversification strategy, which includes an immunology, oncology, and neuroscience drugs pipeline, may help it continue to thrive. Abbvie has consistently paid and increased dividends for the past 53 years, cementing its reputation as a dependable dividend payer. Valued at $358 billion, AbbVie stock is down 14% year-to-date.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s financial health is bolstered by its strong earnings growth. The fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings, however, were impacted by in-process research and development that it took on as part of the Arena Pharmaceuticals acquisition and milestone expenses, which amounted to 10.4% of net revenue. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 2024 fell by 8.9% to $10.12. Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted EPS to be between $12.12 and $12.32 in 2025, up from $12.04 in 2024, reflecting confidence in long-term growth. Similarly, analysts covering AbbVie stock forecast earnings to grow by 21.2% in 2025 and 12.6% in 2026.\n\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq, AbbVie\u2019s newer immunology drugs, have contributed significantly to the company\u2019s positive outlook. Skyrizi\u2019s sales in 2024 were $11.7 billion, up 50.9% year on year, while Rinvoq\u2019s were $5.9 billion, up 50.4%. AbbVie has a forward dividend yield of 3.2%, which is higher than the healthcare sector average of 1.6%. The forward payout ratio of 47.2% is sustainable, leaving room for dividend growth. Overall, on Wall Street, AbbVie stock is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d Out of the 26 analysts covering the stock, 16 have a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and eight recommend a \u201cHold\u201d rating. The mean target price for ABBV is $207.20, which is 1.5% above its current levels. Its high price estimate of $239 implies potential upside of 17.1% over the next 12 months.\n\nDividend King #3: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) is a multinational beverage giant that manufactures and markets a wide range of non-alcoholic beverages, including carbonated soft drinks, juices, bottled water, sports drinks, and energy drinks. Coca-Cola has an impressive track record of 62 consecutive years of dividend increases, demonstrating its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nValued at $304.5 billion, KO stock is up 13.7% year-to-date.\n\nIn the most recent fourth quarter, adjusted comparable EPS rose 12% to $0.55 per share. For the full year, comparable EPS increased by 7% to $2.88 per share. The company generated a free cash flow of $4.7 billion in the year and paid out $8.4 billion in dividends. Coca-Cola is adapting to changing consumer preferences by diversifying its portfolio beyond traditional soft drinks. In 2025, the company expects to generate $9.5 billion in free cash flow while growing EPS by 2% to 3%. Analysts expect earnings to rise 2.8% in 2025, followed by 7.78% in 2026.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s forward dividend yield of 2.9% is significantly higher than the consumer staples sector average of 1.9%. Furthermore, its forward payout ratio of 63.9% indicates the company can maintain its dividend payments, with the possibility of future increases.\n\nOverall, Wall Street is bullish on KO stock, rating it a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d Out of the 22 analysts covering KO, 19 rate it as a \"Strong Buy,\" one as a \u201cModerate buy,\u201d and two as a \u201cHold.\u201d The mean target price for KO is $76.05, which is 7.15% above current levels. Its high target price of $85 implies potential upside of 20% over the next 12 months.",

            "content": "Imagine being able to buy a machine that would work day after day and year after year to make you money. Now imagine being able to buy several such machines. This would be a utopia for anyone seeking passive income.\n\nThe good news is you don't have to use your imagination. These \"machines\" exist -- and they're called dividend stocks. There are no guarantees in investing, but these stocks can help set you up for success. If you want decades of passive income, here are three stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie (ABBV -0.72%) pays a dividend with a forward yield of 3.2% as I write this. Even better, though, is the drugmaker's dividend track record. AbbVie has increased its dividend for an impressive 52 consecutive years, ranking it among the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings.\n\nIf you want a textbook example of a resilient stock, AbbVie is it. Consider that only two years ago the company faced the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Humira. This autoimmune disease drug wasn't just AbbVie's best-selling product, it ranked for years as the top-selling drug in the world.\n\nHowever, AbbVie continues to thrive. How? It invested heavily in research and development. It made smart business development deals. Today, the company has two successors to Humira on the market that should together generate much higher annual sales by 2027 than Humira did at its peak.\n\nAbbVie has demonstrated its ability to deliver long-term growth despite the inevitable disruptions from patent expirations. As a result, its stock can provide reliable passive income for decades.\n\n2. Brookfield Infrastructure\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure (BIP 0.57%) (BIPC 0.45%) is another remarkably resilient stock. The company operates data centers, electricity transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, semiconductor manufacturing foundries, telecommunications towers, terminals, toll roads, and more.\n\nThese businesses provide Brookfield Infrastructure with stable and steady cash flow. Around 85% of the company's funds from operations (FFO) are contracted or regulated. Roughly the same percentage is also indexed for or protected from inflation.\n\nFor investors seeking passive income, this translates to dependable and growing distributions. Brookfield Infrastructure has increased its distribution by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% since 2004. Its yields are also juicy. The limited partnership (LP) trading under the BIP ticker offers a forward yield of 5.3%, while the corporate entity trading under the BIPC ticker's forward yield is around 4%.\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure also has a solid strategy for growth. It acquires infrastructure assets when they're valued attractively. The company then enhances the value of those assets by making operational improvements. Over time, Brookfield recycles mature assets -- selling them to raise capital to repeat the cycle.\n\n3. Realty Income\n\nIf you want especially significant passive income, consider buying shares of Realty Income (O -0.60%). This real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a forward dividend yield of 5.8% as I write this. And it pays those dividends on a monthly rather than quarterly basis.\n\nRealty Income's story gets even better, though. The company has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years. During this period, the dividend grew by a CAGR of 4.3%.\n\nThis isn't a run-of-the-mill REIT. Realty Income ranks as the seventh-largest REIT in the world. It owns 15,621 properties leased to 1,565 clients representing 89 industries. Nearly one-third of the company's annual rent comes from convenience, grocery, discount, and home improvement stores -- the kinds of businesses that hold up well regardless of how the economy is faring.\n\nRealty Income might not deliver jaw-dropping growth, but its growth prospects could be better than you think. The company is targeting a $5.4 trillion total addressable market in the U.S. and an $8.5 trillion total addressable market in Europe. It should have key growth opportunities in freestanding retail, industrial, and data center properties.",

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "AbbVie (ABBV) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +16.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which AbbVie belongs, has gained 9.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, AbbVie is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of +10% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.29 points to a change of +21.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.93 indicates a change of +13.4% from what AbbVie is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for AbbVie.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of AbbVie, the consensus sales estimate of $12.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.1%. The $59.5 billion and $64.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.6% and +7.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAbbVie reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.56%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAbbVie is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about AbbVie. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms. With a fast-growing customer base (already 50+ million) and a diverse set of cutting edge solutions, this stock is poised for big gains. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Legal agreements aimed at escaping lengthy patent litigation delayed market entry of Stelara biosimilars in the U.S.J&J Chief Financial Officer Joe Wolk has said the Stelara biosimilar market was likely to unfurl similarly to that of AbbVie's blockbuster arthritis drug Humira - once the world's best-selling prescription drug - given contracting practices and doctor and patient resistance to switching medicines.AbbVie held onto almost all of the Humira market for more than a year after close copies of the drug were launched in early 2023. That changed when CVS Health removed Humira from its list of covered drugs and more patients switched to a biosimilar in three weeks than had in the prior 15 months.CVS, which owns a pharmacy benefit manager that negotiates rebates and fees with manufacturers and creates lists of medications, known as formularies, that are covered by insurance, replaced Humira with a biosimilar that was jointly marketed with its Cordavis unit, a private label provider.J&J in its lawsuit said Humira's market erosion was illustrative of the harm Samsung Bioepis' private label deal could have.Stelara biosimilars launched in Europe, Canada and a few other markets last year, and at least seven close copies of Stelara are expected to begin selling in the U.S. this year.Pyzchiva is approved to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.Teva Pharmaceuticals and Alvotech last Friday launched Selarsdi, a biosimilar to Stelara. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed the use of Selarsdi as an \"interchangeable\" Stelara substitute only after April 30, when the exclusive rights for Amgen's version Wezlana expire.

            "content": "BioSpace CEO Josh Goodwin accidentally started a book club among the editorial team here when he recommended For Blood and Money by Nathan Vardi a few weeks ago. Everyone is reading it or has it in their to-be-read pile. Mine just arrived this morning, conveniently dropping on my door step a mere 12 hours after I had finished a rather unsatisfying book.\n\nFor Blood and Money follows the development of a BTK inhibitor developed by Pharmacyclics from its discovery all the way to approval. I haven\u2019t read it yet so that\u2019s about the extent of my knowledge at the moment, gleaned from the back cover and the first few pages. But the delightful facts dropped as our Managing Editor Jef Akst reads along have been enough to move it up to highest priority in my ever-shuffling stack of books.\n\nDid you know, for instance, that Pfizer once tried to buy AstraZeneca for $118 billion? Could you imagine those two companies merging? One, an oncology powerhouse with deep European roots. The other, one of the world\u2019s saviors from the global COVID-19 crisis, which has stuttered in recent years once the pandemic wave reached the shore. For the record, S&P Capital IQ values the deal at around $127 billion.\n\nThis industry would have been a much different place with those two behemoths as one. Indeed, the pandemic may have been too, with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine capabilities combined with Pfizer\u2019s. Who knows what could have been.\n\nSpeculations aside, this fact sent us down the rabbit hole wondering how we would cover such a crazy deal and searching for the biggest pharma deals ever. The biggest I have covered as a journalist was Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s purchase of Celgene for $74 billion in 2019, followed months later by AbbVie buying Allergan for $63 billion.\n\nThose two deals made me think that size was commonplace. It isn\u2019t. Prior to those two, the biggest was Takeda and Shire , a January 2019 takeover that was valued at $62.2 billion but which actually amounts to $80 billion if you include Shire\u2019s debt that Takeda took on.\n\nSince those heady years when pharma seemed to have an appetite for massive acquisitions, the biggest deal has been Pfizer\u2019s $43 billion takeover of Seagen in 2023.\n\nSpeaking of Pfizer, did you know the pharma giant also tried to buy Allergan? The company appears over and over when you look at historical deal attempts, suggesting it was the hottest thing in pharma from around 2014 until AbbVie finally sealed the deal. In 2015, Pfizer made a play for the aesthetics drug maker, bidding $363.63 per share. That put the total enterprise value of the potential transaction at a whopping $160 billion, blowing any record then or now out of the water. But Pfizer decided to terminate the deal because of changes announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury that qualified as an adverse tax law change for the companies. AbbVie ended up buying Allergan for the much cheaper price of about $123.23 per share.\n\nIn essence, the Pfizer-Allergan deal was scuttled by policy changes. Sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it? Many industry watchers began to think that 2025 could be the year megadeals return. But early indications from the Trump administration suggest the much-talked-about antitrust relief that many expected may not arrive. The new Federal Trade Commission Chairman told staff last week that guidelines put in place by former President Joe Biden on mergers would remain for now.\n\nOf course, we can only imagine what is going on in industry board rooms. Maybe our BioSpace book club will spawn the ultimate nerdy pursuit: biopharma merger fan fiction.\n\nIf anyone catches Albert Bourla and Pascal Soriot strolling around Cambridge\u2014the U.K. one or the Massachusetts one\u2014do let us know. For now, here\u2019s a recap of the biggest deals in pharma that never came to be, leaving us forever wondering, what if?",

With an aging population and growing preference for sustained-release therapies, DURYSTA could capture a significant share of the multi-billion-dollar glaucoma treatment market.\n\nDelveInsight\u2019s \u201cDURYSTA Market Size, Forecast, and Market Insight Report\u201d highlights the details around DURYSTA, the first and only FDA-approved dissolvable ocular implant to reduce eye pressure in people with open-angle glaucoma or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension). The report provides product descriptions, patent details, and competitor products (marketed and emerging therapies) of DURYSTA. The report also highlights the historical and forecasted sales from 2020 to 2034 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nAbbVie\u2019s DURYSTA (bimatoprost SR) Overview\n\nDURYSTA (bimatoprost intracameral implant) is a prescription treatment designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. This solid, rod-shaped implant contains the prostaglandin analog (PGA) bimatoprost and utilizes the company\u2019s Novadur drug delivery platform. It is inserted into the eye using a prefilled, single-use applicator, which gradually releases the medication as the biodegradable copolymer matrix dissolves. The implant is formulated to reduce IOP for at least four months.\n\nBimatoprost mimics the action of prostamides, particularly prostaglandin F2\u03b1, by enhancing the outflow of aqueous humor, thereby reducing elevated IOP and lowering the risk of optic nerve damage. It is believed to achieve this effect by increasing aqueous humor drainage through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways, decreasing resistance to fluid outflow. Currently, bimatoprost is also available as a once-daily ophthalmic solution (Lumigan) for managing high IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.\n\nDURYSTA is a single-use ophthalmic drug delivery system for intracameral administration, containing 10 mcg of bimatoprost. It should not be re-administered to an eye that has already received a prior implant.\n\nDrug Name DURYSTA (bimatoprost SR) Molecule type Small molecule Developer AbbVie Approvals Open-angle glaucoma or Ocular hypertension Mechanism of action Reduction in IOP/Prostaglandin analog Route of administration Intracameral implant\n\nLearn more about DURYSTA projected market size for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension @ DURYSTA Market Potential\n\nOcular hypertension (OHT) is a broad term used to describe any condition where intraocular pressure (IOP) exceeds 21 mm Hg, the generally recognized upper threshold of normal eye pressure. In OHT, the eye\u2019s drainage system does not function efficiently, leading to increased pressure. This condition is important as it may serve as a precursor to glaucoma, a severe eye disease that can cause permanent vision loss. According to Delveinsight\u2019s estimates, the total number of OHT cases in the United States was approximately 9 million in 2023, with projections indicating further growth by 2034.\n\nThe current treatment landscape for OHT is categorized into various therapeutic classes, including prostaglandin analogs, beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sympathomimetics, and miotics. Several approved treatments, such as iDoseTR, OMLONTI, and DURYSTA, are shaping the existing OHT market in the US, which is expected to expand further by 2034. This growth will be primarily driven by the introduction of new therapies that are anticipated to revolutionize the treatment landscape.\n\nDiscover more about the ocular hypertension market in detail @ Ocular Hypertension Market Report\n\nEmerging Competitors of DURYSTA\n\nSeveral companies such as TearClear (TC-002 (latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%)), Betaliq (BTQ-1902), Nicox Ophthalmics (NCX 470), Santen Inc./Ono Pharmaceutical (Sepetaprost), Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company/Visiox Pharma (PDP-716), Santen Pharmaceutical (STN-1012600), and others are developing drugs for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.\n\nThe anticipated launch of these therapies will give a boost to the open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension market but at the same time, it will also create a competitive space between the already approved DURYSTA and these emerging therapies.\n\nTo know more about the number of competing drugs in development, visit @ DURYSTA Market Positioning Compared to Other Drugs\n\nKey Developmental Activities of DURYSTA\n\nIn May 2020, AbbVie officially closed its USD 63-billion acquisition of Allergan to create a larger, stronger, and more diversified global biopharmaceutical company.\n\nofficially closed its USD 63-billion acquisition of Allergan to create a larger, stronger, and more diversified global biopharmaceutical company. In March 2020, the US FDA approved bimatoprost sustained-release in open-angle glaucoma patients.

With the approval, the drug became the first intracameral, biodegradable sustained-release implant indicated to reduce IOP in patients with OAG or OHT. In February 2020, Allergan presented new data on Bimatoprost Sustained-Release (SR) at the AGS Annual Meeting in Washington, DC. The Phase III ARTEMIS study highlighted visual field outcomes and disease progression in open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Additional findings showed its intraocular pressure-lowering effects across Phase I/II and Phase III trials. At the time, an FDA review was underway for Bimatoprost SR, a potential first-in-class biodegradable intracameral implant for sustained IOP reduction in OAG and ocular hypertension.\n\npresented new data on Bimatoprost Sustained-Release (SR) at the AGS Annual Meeting in Washington, DC.

The NDA was based on the positive results from the ARTEMIS Phase III studies and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to providing new treatments for patients with glaucoma.\n\nDURYSTA Patent Details\n\nIn May 2018, Allergan, Inc. was granted a patent with the number 2005110380, publication number WO-2005110380-A1, and application number US-2005014021-W. This patent pertains to prostamide-containing intraocular implants and their methods of use. The granted patent is anticipated to remain in effect until October 2034, providing Allergan exclusive rights to these innovations in intraocular implant technology for an extended period.\n\nDiscover how DURYSTA is shaping the open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension treatment landscape @ DURYSTA Injection\n\nDURYSTA Market Dynamics\n\nOnce implanted, DURYSTA can provide sustained intraocular pressure control for a significant period, reducing the frequency of treatments compared to eye drops. This can enhance patient adherence and convenience, particularly for individuals who struggle with daily eye drop regimens. Additionally, DURYSTA eliminates issues related to improper drop administration and potential side effects of preservatives found in topical medications.\n\nHowever, the implantation process requires a minor surgical procedure, which may pose risks such as infection, inflammation, or corneal endothelial cell loss. The irreversible nature of the implant and potential limitations on repeat dosing may also be concerns. Cost considerations and insurance coverage could impact accessibility for some patients.\n\nOngoing technological advancements might lead to improvements in the implant design, making it more efficient, safer, and easier to administer, while regulatory approvals and long-term clinical data will play a critical role in broader adoption.\n\nDive deeper to get more insight into DURYSTA\u2019s strengths & weaknesses relative to competitors @ DURYSTA Market Drug Report\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1 Report Introduction 2 DURYSTA: AbbVie 2.1 Product Overview 2.2 Other Development Activities 2.3 Clinical Development 2.4 Clinical Trials Information 2.5 Safety and Efficacy 2.6 Product Profile 2.7 Market Assessment 2.7.1 The 7MM Analysis 2.7.1.1 Cost Assumptions and Rebate 2.7.1.2 Pricing Trends 2.7.1.3 Analogue Assessment 2.7.1.4 Launch Year and Therapy Uptake 2.7.2 The United States Market Analysis 2.7.3 EU4 and the United Kingdom Market Analysis 2.7.3.1 Germany 2.7.3.2 France 2.7.3.3 Italy 2.7.3.4 Spain 2.7.3.5 UK 2.7.4 Japan Market Analysis 2.8 Market Drivers 2.9 Market Barriers 2.10 SWOT Analysis 3 Key Cross of Marketed Competitors of DURYSTA 4 Key Cross of Emerging Competitors of DURYSTA\n\nRelated Reports\n\nOcular Hypertension Market\n\nOcular Hypertension Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key ocular hypertension companies including Kubota Vision Inc., Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co.

Humira is used for the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease . Over the last four years, the product generated annual revenues of about 20 billion U.S. dollars. Before the appearance of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty , Humira was the global top drug based on revenue. In some years, the blockbuster made up around two-thirds of the company\u2019s total revenues. Given the threat of patent expiration and generic/biosimilar competition, such a dependence on one product could potentially have negative effects for a pharmaceutical company. Biosimilars of Humira have already been available in several countries since 2014. In AbbVie\u2019s major market, the U.S., Humira started facing biosimilar competition only in 2023, but already combined with heavy revenue losses. AbbVie was quite \u2018famous\u2019 and often criticized due to its aggressive patent strategy and pricing policy for Humira in the United States: dozens of patents were filed for the drug, but for various medical conditions, while between 2016 and 2021, alone Humira's net price increased by 60 percent.In the meantime, AbbVie's product portfolio seems more balanced, with the pressure of revenue-generating much better distributed among its brands. With an increasing R&D spending and as the top advertisement spender among drug manufacturers , the company is resolved to stay in the race over the global pharmaceutical throne.",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best DRIP stocks to own now.\n\nDividend investing is often regarded as a strategy that rewards patience, as it tends to generate stronger returns over the long term. Those who commit to holding their investments for extended periods are typically the ones who reap the greatest benefits. A major factor behind the success of this approach is the power of compounding. By reinvesting dividends\u2014using those payouts to purchase additional shares\u2014investors can enhance the growth of their portfolios. Rather than taking the dividends as cash, reinvesting them allows for a steady increase in share ownership, amplifying potential returns. Over time, this method has proven to be highly effective. In fact, a report from Hartford Funds highlights that since 1960, reinvested dividends and compounding have accounted for 69% of the broader market\u2019s total return.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Dividend Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOver the years, analysts have closely monitored the impact of dividend reinvestment and have expressed favorable opinions about its benefits. Steven Greiner, Managing Director of Schwab Equity Ratings at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, supports this approach. He shares the following insight:\n\n\u201cReinvesting dividends is nearly effortless. Once you set it up\u2014which generally involves simply ticking a box\u2014there\u2019s nothing more to do but sit back and let compounding work its magic. Be aware, however, that companies can reduce or stop paying dividends.\u201d\n\nSteven Greiner\u2019s final point touches on a key concern for dividend investors\u2014the risk of a company suddenly cutting or suspending its dividend payments. No investor wants to be caught in that situation. While many tend to measure success primarily by stock price appreciation, a deeper analysis offers a broader perspective. A study of major global indexes over a 25-year period, ending in March 2018, found that reinvested dividends contributed nearly 3% in additional growth, as reported by Forbes. This underscores the vital role that dividends play in enhancing investment returns beyond just price gains. It serves as a strong reminder that evaluating an investment solely based on stock price movements may offer an incomplete picture. By incorporating dividend reinvestment into the assessment, investors gain a more comprehensive and accurate view of overall performance.\n\nA separate analysis from T. Rowe Price found that over the three decades leading up to 2022, reinvested dividends played a crucial role in market returns, contributing a notable 42.5% to overall gains. The report also emphasized that dividend reinvestment had an even greater impact on a select group of high-performing companies\u2014those that consistently increase their dividends at a rate exceeding the broader market. This effect becomes more powerful over time, as reinvesting a steadily growing dividend further accelerates long-term investment returns.",

            "content": "AbbVie Inc.'s ( ) price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 6.4x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the Biotechs industry in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/S ratios above 10.5x and even P/S above 54x are quite common. However, the P/S might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nWhat Does AbbVie's Recent Performance Look Like?\n\nAbbVie could be doing better as it's been growing revenue less than most other companies lately. The P/S ratio is probably low because investors think this lacklustre revenue performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think AbbVie's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like AbbVie's to be considered reasonable.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.7% gain to the company's revenues. Although, the latest three year period in total hasn't been as good as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. Therefore, it's fair to say that revenue growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.\n\nLooking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 6.6% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 138% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.\n\nWith this information, we can see why AbbVie is trading at a P/S lower than the industry. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nIt's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that AbbVie maintains its low P/S on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider industry, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nThere are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered that you should be aware of.\n\nIf strong companies turning a profit tickle your fancy, then you'll want to check out this free\n\nIf you're looking to trade AbbVie , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

            "content": "From an investor\u2019s perspective, the healthcare sector remains resilient during economic downturns, as demand for critical treatments, pharmaceuticals and procedures stays stable. This ensures consistent revenues and a defensive market position, offering cash flow stability.\n\nSimultaneously, innovations in medical technology and home care services bolster the sector's attractiveness and offer strong potential for high returns on investments. Digital health solutions, artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics and home-based monitoring systems are transforming elder care, creating new revenue opportunities for healthcare firms. Noteworthy is Medtronic 's FDA-cleared smart insulin pen that integrates glucose sensor data, utilizing AI to personalize insulin dosing.\n\nWith rising life expectancy, the prevalence of age-related diseases \u2014 such as cardiovascular conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, osteoporosis and diabetes \u2014 is on the rise. Pharmaceutical companies are ramping up efforts to develop treatments for chronic conditions prevalent in older adults. Those leading the innovation in immunology, oncology and neurodegenerative disease treatments are well-positioned for sustained growth.\n\nThis demographic shift is significantly altering healthcare consumption patterns, creating long-term investment opportunities across pharmaceuticals, medical devices, home care services and digital health solutions. The global geriatric care market, valued at approximately $1 trillion in 2022, is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.3% through 2030. Healthcare giants such as AbbVie , Amgen , Stryker and Dexcom are all capitalizing on this evolving landscape. By enhancing operational efficiency, they are increasingly expanding their presence in the Seniors & Aging Demographics domain.\n\nThe world\u2019s population is aging at an unprecedented pace. According to WHO\u2019s October 2024 report, the number of people aged 60 and older surpassed children under five for the first time in 2020. By 2050, 80% of older adults will reside in low- and middle-income countries, and the proportion of the global population over 60 will nearly double from 12% in 2015 to 22%.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 24, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.\n\n4 Seniors & Aging Demographics Stocks in the Spotlight\n\nAbbvie, as a pharma giant, is actively expanding its focus on the senior and aging demographic through strategic partnerships and investments. The company\u2019s 2024 acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics includes the latter\u2019s lead investigational asset ALIA-1758, an anti-pyroglutamate amyloid beta (3pE-A\u03b2) antibody, which is in development for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and is currently in Phase 1 clinical trial. In oncology, in February 2025, AbbVie entered into a collaboration with Xilio Therapeutics to develop novel tumor-activated immunotherapies focusing on enhancing cancer treatment efficacy.\n\nIn January 2025, AbbVie secured an option to license SIM0500, a blood cancer drug candidate from Simcere Pharmaceuticals, for markets outside China. This deal expands ABBV\u2019s hematologic oncology pipeline. The company also announced an expansion of its Singapore manufacturing facility in 2024. This investment aims to increase biologics production capacity, which will help the company meet the healthcare needs of an aging global population.\n\nAbbVie has several R&D programs with the potential to drive long-term growth. These include next-generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs as well as innovative therapies for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nRecognizing the global demographic shift toward an older population, Amgen, a biotech stalwart, is emphasizing the importance of biopharmaceutical innovation to meet the health needs of aging societies. Management earlier highlighted this commitment at the Financial Times U.S. Pharmaceutical and Biotech Summit, advocating for the development of new medicines tailored to the elderly.\n\nOsteoporosis, a condition prevalent among postmenopausal women, has been a significant focus area for Amgen of late, for which the company introduced EVENITY (romosozumab-aqqg), an advanced bone-building therapy. Amgen's Prolia (denosumab) has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing osteoporotic fracture risk compared to traditional treatments like alendronate.\n\nAmgen is also exploring treatments for conditions like obesity, which significantly impact the aging population. This #3 Ranked company's experimental obesity drug, MariTide, is currently undergoing Phase 2 trials, with results anticipated later this year.\n\nGlobal orthopedic giant Stryker is also making strategic investments to penetrate the growing field of healthcare for seniors and the aging population. Through its Sage brand, Stryker offers products designed to improve patient outcomes and caregiver efficiency across various care settings. These solutions are particularly beneficial for elderly patients requiring home-based care.\n\nIn 2024, the company acquired NICO Corporation, thus enhancing its capabilities in minimally invasive neurosurgery. NICO's technologies offer treatment options for intracerebral hemorrhage, a condition prevalent among the elderly. Further, the acquisition of Vertos Medical expanded Zacks #3 Ranked Stryker's presence in the lumbar spinal stenosis space, a common source of chronic lower back pain in older adults.\n\nStryker is also investing in enhancing medical data platforms and interoperability. These efforts are crucial for improving patient care and operational efficiency, which will benefit the aging population.\n\nDexcom, a leading provider of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, has been actively expanding its offerings to better serve seniors and the aging population. This Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s G7 CGM system is popular among older adults who find its sensor insertion and app setup process simple. Dexcom has also ensured that its CGM systems, including Dexcom G6, are covered by Medicare, increasing its accessibility to seniors.\n\nIn 2024, Dexcom launched Stelo, an over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor designed for adults aged 18 and older who do not use insulin. This device provides real-time glucose readings and insights into how diet and exercise affect glucose levels.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nHannah Rickert is a senior at the University of Rochester who experiences chronic migraines. She is also a winner of the first-ever AbbVie Migraine Career Catalyst Award contest, which awarded 20 individuals up to $2,500 to help support their career aspirations.\n\nTo Rickert, the award represents an acknowledgement of her identity, one that can be hard to see.\n\n\u201cThis really feels like, \u2018Hey, we see you. You\u2019re not invisible even if your disability is,\u2019\u201d says Rickert.\n\nThe award winners were selected based on short essay, video, and audio clip submissions highlighting their experiences living with migraine, their career aspirations, and how the award could help support their future success.\n\nHannah Rickert\n\nApproximately 12 percent of the U.S. population, or 40 million people, reports having migraines. Chronic migraines, where an individual has more than 15 headache days per month, affects about 3 to 5 percent of the population.\n\nOften, migraines have common triggers, but no single cause, making them difficult to diagnose. Triggers include hormonal shifts, allergies, family history, anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, head or neck injuries, or other environmental causes. Rickert says her Apple watch sometimes alerts her to a spike in blood pressure, which is typically linked to an oncoming attack.\n\nMigraines come with many different strains, risk factors, symptoms and alleviations. With each case being so unique, Rickert was only formally diagnosed in her sophomore year of college, a benefit of being close to the UR Medical Center.\n\nShe does remember noticing her headaches were different as early as first grade.\n\n\u201cWe were doing an alliteration project and my name starts with H, so I came up with: \u2018Hannah has horrible headaches,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cEveryone else in my class had these very silly type descriptions, but mine was much more serious. And it just kind of escalated from there.\u201d\n\nSevere headaches, which are often associated with migraines, are simply one of the symptoms caused by the condition and limit the full understanding of the disease. For example, Rickert does not have visual auras in her migraine attacks, a common effect for some, and instead experiences numbness in her left side, sometimes resulting in partial paralysis.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk for a few minutes because my whole leg would stop working essentially,\u201d she says.\n\nThe frequency of migraine attacks for Rickert has fluctuated over the years, but it has generally increased as she has gotten older. Recently, she says, they have occurred as frequently as every other day.\n\nHowever, the biomedical engineering student still has time for academic and extracurricular excellence. Rickert was certified in Solidworks, a 3D modeling program, as a high school freshman.\n\nAt UR, she serves in leadership positions in the UR Society of Women Engineers chapter and as a coach for Transition Opportunities at UR, an inclusive college experience for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Those accomplishments made Rickert a top choice for the AbbVie award.\n\nHer future plans include continuing research in the neurodevelopment field, using electroencephalogram or other imaging technologies to study people with schizophrenia, for example. Independently, Rickert has also researched different strains of migraines, with the intent of better understanding the condition.\n\n\u201cMy most recent was actually on hemiplegic migraine and different types of treatment that you could maybe pair together, looking more on the neural level and the genetic level,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty interesting to be able to look at something I have on that level and do a research-style paper to get funding from the NIH.\u201d\n\nJacob Schermerhorn is a Rochester Beacon contributing writer and data journalist.\n\nThe Beacon welcomes comments and letters from readers who adhere to our comment policy including use of their full, real name.

            "content": "We recently published a list of S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Sentiment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against other S&P 500 dividend aristocrats sorted by hedge fund sentiment.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. While they are an integral part of the broader market, they have been overshadowed recently by the surge in technology stocks. In 2024, the Dividend Aristocrats Index rose by about 6%, trailing the broader market\u2019s nearly 27% gain and NASDAQ\u2019s impressive 35% return. However, the long-term appeal of dividend stocks remains strong. These companies have proved their mettle, continuing to reward shareholders even during challenging market conditions.\n\nHistorical data underscores the effectiveness of dividends in keeping pace with inflation and cushioning the effects of economic downturns over the past century. This makes them a crucial element of long-term investment strategies. Dividend payouts have remained relatively stable compared to earnings per share across multiple recessions. For instance, during the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis, while the broader market dropped by 41% and earnings per share plunged by 92%, dividends per share declined by just 6%, according to a report by The Vanguard Group. This stability plays a key role in preserving income streams and enhancing total returns, which factor in both price appreciation and reinvested dividends.\n\nREAD ALSO: These Were Last Week\u2019s 10 Best Dividend Stocks\n\nThe report also emphasized the importance of diversifying investments across different sectors and regions to safeguard against industry-specific downturns and geopolitical uncertainties. A clear example of this occurred during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 when European banks, following regulatory directives, suspended dividend payments to account for potential loan losses. Although many banks were financially capable of maintaining payouts, most distributions were delayed until 2021, disrupting investors\u2019 regular income. Adopting a diversified investment strategy not only helps stabilize cash flow but also strengthens overall returns, making portfolios more resilient to economic volatility.\n\nThat said, a company\u2019s history of annual dividend increases, no matter how long, does not guarantee future payouts. The year 2020 served as a significant test of the stability of Dividend Aristocrats. When the pandemic hit in March, consumer demand plummeted across various industries, leading many companies to reduce or suspend their dividends. Some made this decision voluntarily, while others were required to do so as a condition of accepting stimulus funds. By the end of 2020, a total of 66 companies within the broader market had distributed less in dividends compared to 2019.\n\nIn recent years, dividend investing has gained popularity, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility. Investors have increasingly recognized the value of dividend stocks, steadily allocating capital to them to benefit from their long-term potential. Annual dividend payouts from the broader market have been rising, climbing from $420 billion in 2017 to $522 billion in 2021 and reaching a record $588.2 billion by 2023. This upward trend highlights the role of dividend stocks in generating both growth and income over time. In addition, dividends have been a significant driver of overall market returns, accounting for approximately 17% of the total return from 2013 to 2022, according to a Morgan Stanley report.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nDividend aristocrats are the companies that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. We scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and picked the top 10 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "In June 2024, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and AbbVie launched the Diabetic Eye Conditions (DEC) Coalition. A group of regional and global partners centered in Europe, the DEC Coalition\u2019s primary initiative is to engage European policymakers in prevention of diabetes and related eye complications. The DEC Coalition shared its five calls to action last summer in hopes of sparking actions in the lead-up to the IAPB Global Eye Health Summit 2026.1\n\nTo learn more about the DEC Coalition and its directives, Ophthalmology Times Europe spoke with Francesco Bandello, MD, FEBO, who is head of the ophthalmology unit at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. Prof Bandello was a key participant in the launch of the DEC Coalition. In this interview, he contextualised the group\u2019s five-point call to action.\n\nFive actions that can reshape DEC in Europe\n\n\u201cWith the global rise in diabetes and an ageing population, the incidence of diabetic eye conditions is expected to grow,\u201d reads a statement from the DEC Coalition at launch. \u201cDespite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, many people remain undiagnosed and untreated, missing the opportunity to prevent a disability that has a serious impact on individuals and society.\u201d1\n\nProf Bandello described those five calls to action as crucial to management of DECs, because they empower and inform patients. \u201cIt's very easy to motivate patients when the broader culture is one of education and information,\u201d he said.\n\nThe DEC Coalition calls on policymakers to:\n\nIntegrate eye health into European diabetes policies, national health strategic plans and primary care models\n\nStandardise screening protocols for DEC to ensure consistent and high-quality care across Europe\n\nExpand comprehensive patient education programmes across settings and age groups, to raise awareness and enhance self-management of DEC\n\nAdvance equitable access to innovative diagnostics, treatments and assistive technologies for people living with DEC across Europe\n\nEnhance data collection and data sharing across health systems to inform regional and national policies that aim to improve care for people living with DEC\n\n\u201cBuilding a culture of awareness from very early on is so important,\u201d said Prof Bandello. \u201cThe level of knowledge, and the accessibility of information within a country\u2019s or region\u2019s culture, make all the difference.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of IAPB/DEC Coalition.\n\nA shifting focus in DEC\n\nOpportunities for patient education become more important as the population of patients with diabetes and DECs grows. \u201cI have seen a huge increase of diabetic patients in my country,\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cThe number of patients with diabetes in Italy has increased. But if you look at the level of diabetic retinopathy, during these last few years, it has been showing some improvement.\u201d\n\nIn his practice in Italy and across Europe, Prof Bandello said, the most advanced forms of diabetic retinopathy are receding in commonality. \u201cWe do not see the most advanced form, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which was very common previously, as much as we did in the past,\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cAnd the obvious reason for that is that the quality of diabetes treatment has improved. The quality of metabolic control in these patients improved, and generally speaking, patients are now empowered to treat diabetes much more effectively.\u201d\n\nNow, he said, most clinicians are working to manage non-proliferative forms of retinopathy, or other ocular complications of diabetes. One such DEC is diabetic macular oedema (DMO), which has surged within many patient groups, Prof Bandello said. \u201cMaybe this is because we are able to have a more accurate diagnosis of DMO using optical coherence tomography (OCT),\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cIn any case, DMO has become the most pressing ocular condition among patients with diabetes.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, Prof Bandello predicted, clinicians and industry partners will make DMO a main focus in eye care. That shifting focus towards macular oedema is already underway, he noted, as exhibited by the increasing availability and accessibility of therapies for DMO. \u201cPreviously, we were not able to do as much for patients with DMO as we are today. We did not have any intravitreal therapy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, the therapies that were available for DMO, like laser treatments, were absolutely not comparable with the intravitreal therapies that we have today. As DMO becomes and remains the main topic in diabetic eye care, those therapies can only improve.\u201d\n\nGlobal leaders, clinical perspectives\n\nA primary goal of the DEC Coalition is to \u201cintegrate eye health into European diabetes policies, national health strategic plans and primary care models.\u201d According to Prof Bandello, this is a strategy that, while simple on it face, would have the biggest impact on patients throughout Europe.\n\n\u201cFollow up is one of the most important things in chronic diseases such as diabetes,\u201d Prof Bandello emphasised. \u201cFor follow up, for advanced therapies, you need good compliance, and for that, you need education. You need knowledge.\u201d Clinicians need to ensure that patients are informed about their disease, both its current status and management options, and what the future outlook is for progression and visual acuity, Prof Bandello said.\n\nHe continued, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we, as clinicians, should push [policymakers] to install, from elementary school, some kind of education about diabetes. We need to teach very young people how to have a good quality of life, how to exercise and how to have the best possible diet. And all these things must be started in the elementary school years.\u201d\n\nManagement of DECs, he said, is improving, but the outcomes are often too little, too late. \u201cWhat is happening now is that we always arrive late,\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cThe most important thing should be first-line prevention of diabetes, primary prevention. Secondary prevention, of diabetic eye conditions or other complications, is already too late for the patient with diabetes. Preventing diabetes is simply much, much better.\u201d\n\nHere, Prof Bandello said, it becomes clear that patient education is not enough: policymakers across Europe need to be educated, too. Clinician-researchers can and should inform policymakers about what is possible in diabetes management, the benefits of prevention, and the economic factors tied to treatment and prevention of DECs, Prof Bandello said.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, [many policymakers] do not consider clinicians' interest in education and screening important,\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cThey understand that the results that we see from the implementation of screening programmes may only emerge after 10 or 15 years.\u201d For many people in government, Prof Bandello said, 15 years is \u201can entire political life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these cases, the policymakers are only sensitive to what is happening in 1 year, in 18 months, when they have the next election,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, they prioritise something that delivers visible results in a very short time.\u201d This makes advocacy work vitally important, Prof Bandello said. While some people in government may not be \u201csensitive\u201d to the urgency of preventative care, \u201cWhen you explain it to them, they do understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do understand the problems. They are smart people, and they can see why preventative education is so important for reducing the impact of diabetes,\u201d Prof Bandello said. \u201cBut, at least in my experience, policymakers are not as motivated as clinicians to make that change, which is why groups like the DEC Coalition are necessary.\u201d\n\nReference\n\n1.

            "content": "AbbVie Inc.'s (NYSE:ABBV) stock was strong despite it releasing a soft earnings report last week. Our analysis suggests that investors may have noticed some promising signs beyond the statutory profit figures.\n\nView our latest analysis for AbbVie\n\nNYSE:ABBV Earnings and Revenue History February 21st 2025\n\nZooming In On AbbVie's Earnings\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. You could think of the accrual ratio from cashflow as the 'non-FCF profit ratio'.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nAbbVie has an accrual ratio of -0.22 for the year to December 2024. That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit. In fact, it had free cash flow of US$18b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of US$4.24b. AbbVie did see its free cash flow drop year on year, which is less than ideal, like a Simpson's episode without Groundskeeper Willie. However, that's not all there is to consider. We can see that unusual items have impacted its statutory profit, and therefore the accrual ratio.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nAbbVie's profit was reduced by unusual items worth US$12b in the last twelve months, and this helped it produce high cash conversion, as reflected by its unusual items. This is what you'd expect to see where a company has a non-cash charge reducing paper profits. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. In the twelve months to December 2024, AbbVie had a big unusual items expense. As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items made its statutory profit significantly weaker than it would otherwise be.\n\nStory Continues",

According to WHO\u2019s October 2024 report, the number of people aged 60 and older surpassed children under five for the first time in 2020. By 2050, 80% of older adults will reside in low- and middle-income countries, and the proportion of the global population over 60 will nearly double from 12% in 2015 to 22%.\n\nThis demographic shift is significantly altering healthcare consumption patterns, creating long-term investment opportunities across pharmaceuticals, medical devices, home care services and digital health solutions. The global geriatric care market, valued at approximately $1 trillion in 2022, is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.3% through 2030. Healthcare giants such as AbbVie ABBV, Amgen AMGN, Stryker SYK and Dexcom DXCM are all capitalizing on this evolving landscape. By enhancing operational efficiency, they are increasingly expanding their presence in the Seniors & Aging Demographics domain.\n\nWith rising life expectancy, the prevalence of age-related diseases \u2014 such as cardiovascular conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, osteoporosis and diabetes \u2014 is on the rise. Pharmaceutical companies are ramping up efforts to develop treatments for chronic conditions prevalent in older adults. Those leading the innovation in immunology, oncology and neurodegenerative disease treatments are well-positioned for sustained growth.\n\nSimultaneously, innovations in medical technology and home care services bolster the sector's attractiveness and offer strong potential for high returns on investments. Digital health solutions, artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics and home-based monitoring systems are transforming elder care, creating new revenue opportunities for healthcare firms. Noteworthy is Medtronic's MDT FDA-cleared smart insulin pen that integrates glucose sensor data, utilizing AI to personalize insulin dosing. Abbott ABT, on the other hand, has introduced Lingo, a wearable device that monitors multiple biomarkers, including glucose levels.\n\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, the healthcare sector remains resilient during economic downturns, as demand for critical treatments, pharmaceuticals and procedures stays stable. This ensures consistent revenues and a defensive market position, offering cash flow stability.\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

Feel free to contact Angela Gabriel at angela.gabriel@biospace.com.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not say how many jobs it cut.\n\nIn November 2023, Orna let go less than a quarter of its staff, Endpoints News reported at the time. Regarding this month\u2019s layoffs, spokesperson Peg Rusconi told STAT, \u201cWe believe that realigning our resources toward rapidly advancing our maturing panCAR programs will best position us to deliver our potentially breakthrough therapies to patients in need.\u201d\n\nSTAT noted the biotech, which designs circular RNA therapeutics, will also focus on the vaccine collaboration with Merck announced in 2022.\n\nAimed at treating autoimmune and oncology diseases, Orna\u2019s in vivo CAR platform panCAR combines its oRNA technology with proprietary lipid nanoparticles to make therapies that modify immune cells. The company hopes to bring its panCAR drug candidates to clinical trials by 2026, according to its website.\n\nNovember 12\n\nGenetic testing company 23andMe announced Nov. 11 that it will lay off more than 200 employees\u2014about 40% of its workforce\u2014as part of a sweeping business restructuring effort to streamline its operations and cut costs. That restructuring includes discontinuing its development of new therapies, instead focusing on its genetic testing services and products.\n\nThe employee cuts will cost the Sunnyvale, California, business up to $12 million in severance, transition and termination-related costs. In return, 23andMe expects to generate over $35 million in annualized savings.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 11\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific will lay off 160 employees across three Massachusetts locations, according to a Nov. 7 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The Wilmington-based tools and services company is letting go staff in Lexington, Plainville and Cambridge between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. Thermo Fisher will close the Lexington facility, the Boston Business Journal reported.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Thermo Fisher employed about 122,000 people globally, including 61,000 in the Americas, according to a February SEC filing. The Boston Business Journal stated the company had about 4,100 employees in Massachusetts as of September.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s 50,000-square-foot, $90 million contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) site in Lexington opened in 2019. At that time, it was expected to add more than 200 jobs, employing scientists, quality control specialists and production teams to support development, testing and manufacture of viral vectors.\n\nAccording to the Boston Business Journal, in a letter to the state explaining the cuts, Thermo Fisher wrote that it continuously evaluates its global operations for opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness in meeting customers\u2019 needs. It added that to further use its state-of the-art Plainville facility and better optimize resources across its manufacturing network, as well as due to \u201cexternal constraints regarding our Cambridge site,\u201d it would adjust staffing in Cambridge and Plainville, cease operations in Lexington and transfer programs from Lexington to Plainville.\n\nThe 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services ranging from process development to commercial manufacturing.\n\nNovember 11\n\nCharles River Laboratories has laid off more than 6% of its employees\u2014over 1,300 people\u2014since 2023, Endpoints News reported following the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company\u2019s Nov. 6 earnings call. The company also shared during the call that it\u2019s begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites to consolidate capacity that\u2019s no longer needed given lower demand for its products and services, according to Endpoints. Those locations focus on its discovery and safety assessment and regulatory management services.\n\nWhile Endpoints requested additional details about the closures, Charles River did not say which locations are shutting down or if staff cuts are involved.\n\nIn September, Charles River confirmed to BioSpace that it was laying off 3% of its employees, saying in an emailed statement that it was reducing its workforce and streamlining its cost structure to optimize its footprint, more effectively support clients and drive greater operating efficiencies. An SEC filing stated the company had about 21,800 employees as of Dec. 30, so that workforce reduction may have affected about 650 people.\n\nNovember 7\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring to grow its lupus nephritis drug Lupkynis and rapidly develop its autoimmune disease candidate AUR200, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is cutting about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 7. The Edmonton, Alberta\u2013based biopharma company, which has a U.S. commercial hub in Rockville, Maryland, did not say which locations the layoffs affect or when they\u2019ll be complete.\n\nThis is the second known workforce reduction this year for Aurinia. In February, the company announced it would cut at least 25% of its employees during the first quarter. That news came after Aurinia failed to find a buyer, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nIn its Nov. 7 announcement, Aurinia stated the restructuring will improve operational efficiency and should save the company more than $40 million in annualized cash-based operating expenses. The business also noted net product revenue of $158.6 million for the first nine months of 2024. Its full-year guidance range is $210 million to $220 million for the fiscal year.\n\nNovember 7\n\nJust months after cutting 23% of its workforce, Viracta Therapeutics let go of 42% of employees as it increased focus on lead product candidate nana-val in lymphoma patients. The Cardiff, Calif., biotech announced the latest layoffs Nov. 6. An SEC filing that same day stated the cuts were effective Oct. 31.\n\nThe company\u2019s board makeup also decreased Oct. 31 with the voluntary resignations of 4 of its 10 directors, according to the announcement.\n\nViracta had 40 full-time employees as of March 31, as stated in a May SEC filing. Based on cutting 23% of staff in August and 42% in October, the biotech now has about 18 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the story.\n\nNovember 6\n\nAs Astellas Gene Therapies continues to wind down its San Francisco biomanufacturing facility, the Astellas Pharma business is laying off 10 employees there effective Jan. 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nThe facility closure is expected to be complete by March 2025, affecting about 100 employees. How many of those employees are being let go is unknown, but cuts date back a few months. Seven people were laid off effective Oct. 21, and 10 were cut effective June 19.\n\nAstellas Gene Therapies will move the San Francisco biomanufacturing facility\u2019s programs and projects to its Sanford, North Carolina, location.\n\nFor more details about the closure, read the article.\n\nNovember 5\n\nAs a result of a pipeline shift and other changes intended to extend its cash runway, Sana Biotechnology is laying off employees, the company announced Nov. 4. The Seattle-based company did not specify the number of cuts, when they will occur or which sites are affected. The biotech has locations in Seattle, San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Sana had 328 employees, 251 of whom were involved in research and development activities, according to a February SEC filing.\n\nThe layoff news comes roughly a year after Sana downsized its staff by about 120 employees\u201429%\u2014as it focused resources on its hypoimmune platform. That October 2023 workforce reduction was preceded by layoffs of an unknown number of staff in August 2023.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 4\n\nAs part of its previously announced layoffs, Sage Therapeutics let go 69 employees in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Oct. 31, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The Cambridge-based biotech had announced on Oct. 17 that it would cut over 165 employees, or about 33% of its workforce, a move it expected to mostly compete by the end of the year.\n\nThe workforce reduction is part of a strategic reorganization of Sage\u2019s business operations, affecting about 55% of the company\u2019s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team. The biotech announced the reorganization about a week after it shared it had discontinued development of dalzanemdor in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nFor more details about the overall employee cuts, read the article.\n\nOctober 31\n\nCompass Pathways will delay pivotal Phase III readouts for its psilocybin-based therapy for treatment-resistant depression, resulting in a layoff of around 30% of its workforce, the psychedelic drug developer announced Oct. 31. The cuts will include some management positions.\n\nCompass had 32 employees at the end of December 2023, 19 of whom were primarily involved in research and development and clinical activities, according to an SEC filing.\n\nThe company, which revealed the delays in its third quarter business update, had expected data from a first Phase III trial, COMP005, this quarter, according to Fierce Biotech. Compass has now shifted that timeline to the second quarter of 2025. The company had also anticipated data from a second Phase III trial, COMP006, around the middle of 2025, Fierce reported. This readout has now been pushed back to the second half of 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nOctober 30\n\nAs part of a restructuring following the suspension of its development program for an antibiotic candidate, Spero Therapeutics will lay off about 39% of its workforce, the company announced Oct. 29. The clinical-stage biopharma expects to mostly complete the cuts by end of the year, according to an Oct. 29 SEC filing.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Spero had 46 employees, 30 of whom were mostly handling R&D activities, as noted in a March 13 SEC filing. If the Cambridge, Massachusetts, business has the same number of employees now, the cuts could affect about 18 people.\n\nRegarding its antibiotic candidate, Spero shared that an interim analysis of the Phase IIa study of SPR720, a treatment being investigated for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, did not meet the primary endpoint.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nOctober 28\n\nAfter announcing a revenue shortfall, Dublin-based contract research organization (CRO) ICON signaled during an investor call that layoffs are coming, Fierce Biotech reported. In the Oct. 24 call, the company\u2019s CEO, Steve Cutler, shared the business is \u201clooking at where we have an excess of people in certain areas\u201d and \u201ctaking fairly decisive actions.\u201d ICON has locations in 45 countries, including the U.S., where it has offices in 11 states.\n\nICON\u2019s third-quarter revenue of $2.03 million, a 1.2% year-over-year decrease, failed to meet expectations for three reasons, according to the company\u2019s earnings announcement. The CRO cited material headwinds from two large customers undergoing budget cuts and development model changes; lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity; and \u201congoing cautiousness\u201d from biotech customers, resulting in award and study delays.\n\nThe company also noted in its announcement that it expects an \u201coutlook for growth over the medium term\u201d and that its year-to-date revenue is $6.24 million, a year-over-year increase of 3.1%, or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\nOctober 25\n\nFollowing a disappointing Phase III trial of ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Marinus Pharmaceuticals is laying off employees as part of cost-cutting measures, the company announced Oct. 24. The commercial-stage pharma is also discontinuing further clinical development of the drug and exploring strategic alternatives with the goal of \u201cmaximizing value for stockholders,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nRadnor, Pennsylvania\u2013based Marinus did not specify how many people it\u2019s letting go or when the layoffs are effective. The company had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. However, that number is likely lower now, as Marinus announced in May that it would reduce its workforce by about 20% as part of cost-cutting measures at that time.\n\nIn its Oct. 24 announcement, Marinus noted that the Phase III TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. It added that while reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance.\n\nOctober 23\n\nAt Pfizer, another group of employees is paying the price for the company\u2019s recent Phase III Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failure.\n\nThe layoffs, which will affect 75 workers at Pfizer\u2019s Sanford, North Carolina, site, come four months after the company\u2019s investigational DMD therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase III trial. Pfizer said the cuts are related to that trial failure, according to Fierce Pharma.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs follows the elimination of 150 positions in Sanford immediately after the Phase III DMD readout. This is also the second round of layoffs in as many weeks at Pfizer after the company handed out 80 layoff notices at its McPherson, Kansas, facility on Oct. 16 and Oct. 17.\n\nOctober 22\n\nPfizer handed out 80 layoff noti",

            "content": "Richter transformation (RT) is an infrequent but consequential event that can occur at any time for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). RT is defined by the development of an aggressive lymphoma, most often diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) [1]. Targeted therapies such as Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2i) have improved survival for patients with CLL, but not for patients with RT [2, 3].\n\nThere have been multiple studies looking at RT that developed after patients received both chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and targeted therapies [2,3,4,5], but no study has focused on RT that has developed without prior CIT. Given the change in standard of care from the use of CIT to targeted agents, it is important to evaluate RT that develops in patients who have only received targeted therapies. Therefore, we sought to determine survival rates and variables that predict survival in patients who developed RT without prior CIT exposure for CLL.\n\nPatients with RT occurring as DLBCL who did not previously receive CIT for their CLL were included in this study. RT was categorized into 3 groups: \u201cConcurrent CLL and RT diagnosis,\u201d\u2014RT and CLL diagnosed within 3 months; \u201cRT-No prior CLL treatment,\u201d\u2014RT and CLL diagnosed >3 months apart with CLL never treated; and \u201cRT-Prior CLL treatment,\u201d\u2014patients having received prior non-CIT CLL treatment. The comparison between groups were conducted using Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and chi-squared test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. Lugano 2014 criteria were used to assign response to therapy and determine disease progression [6]. Progression free survival (PFS) was measured from date of treatment start to progression/death. Overall survival (OS) was measured from RT diagnosis for all patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and the log-rank test was used to compare curves between groups. The association between OS and patient or disease features was quantified through Cox proportional hazards models. See supplement for full description of methods.\n\n309 patients met inclusion criteria. Seventy-nine (25.6%) patients as Concurrent CLL and RT diagnosis, 99 (32.0%) as RT-No prior CLL treatment, and 131 (42.4%) as RT-Prior CLL treatment. (Table 1) Median time from CLL diagnosis to RT was 50.4 months (range: 3.4\u2013394.0) for RT-No prior CLL treatment and 54.4 months (range: 3.3\u2013218.0) for RT-prior CLL treatment. There was no significant change in incidence of TP53 disruption or trisomy 12 in the CLL compartment from CLL to RT diagnosis in any group. There was an increase in the incidence of complex karyotype (CK) in both the untreated and treated groups over time, suggesting the CLL evolved higher risk features regardless of treatment. At RT diagnosis, the median highest SUV on PET-CT was 15.5 (range: 2.1\u201365.5), median LDH was 324 (range: 103\u20138162), and 77.3% had non-Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL. Eighty-nine patients (28.8%) had clonal relationship testing performed, with 73 (82.0%) having clonally related disease. Patients in the RT-Prior CLL treatment group were more likely to have higher LDH, be non-GCB, and have clonally related disease than those who were previously untreated.(Table 1) Table 1 Patient and Disease Characteristics. Full size table\n\nPatients with RT-Prior CLL treatment had received a median of 1 (range: 1\u20135) prior therapy for CLL prior to RT diagnosis: 58.0% received BTKi only; 4.6% BCL2i only; 26.0% received both a BTKi and BCL2i.(Supplemental Table 1) One hundred and three (82.4%) patients developed RT while on treatment with targeted therapy. Patients who developed RT on therapy had higher median LDH (433 vs. 232, p = 0.0018), but had similar median highest SUV on PET-CT (14.8 vs. 16.9, p = 0.40) with no difference in Ki-67.\n\nFor the entire cohort, median follow-up time was 39.4 months, median PFS was 25.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI):18.5\u201343.4), and the median OS was 25.8 months (95% CI: 19.6\u201346.3). Patients with RT-Prior CLL treatment had a shorter median OS (12.3 months) compared to patients with Concurrent CLL and RT diagnosis (46.3 months) and RT-No prior CLL treatment (59.6 months; p = 0.0002).(Fig. 1) The median OS for patients with clonally unrelated disease was not reached, and for patients with clonally related disease it was 23.7 months (95% CI: 12.1\u201340.1). This difference was not statistically significant.(Supplemental Fig. 1) Fig. 1 Overall Survival from RT diagnosis. Full size image\n\nMost patients (n = 294) received treatment for RT. The majority (n = 219, 74.5%) received CIT +/- radiation, 41 (13.9%) received CIT plus targeted therapy, 20 (6.8%) received targeted therapies combined or as single agent, and 14 (4.8%) received treatments termed \u201cother\u201d for first line treatment of their RT. Patients in the RT-Prior CLL treatment group were less likely to achieve a response to first line therapy for RT (overall response rate (ORR) = 57.8%) compared to patients with Concurrent CLL and RT Diagnosis (ORR = 84.0%) and RT-No prior CLL treatment (ORR = 70.8%; p = 0.0006). There was no difference in OS from first line of treatment based on treatment received (Supplemental Fig. 2A); however, responses were highest in patients who received either CIT +/- radiation or CIT plus a targeted therapy.(Supplemental Table 2) Similar results were observed when we analyzed the RT-Prior CLL treatment group separately.(Supplemental Fig. 2B) Forty-six patients received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, response was captured for 42 (91.3%) patients and ORR was 78.6% (complete response (CR) n = 31, partial response (PR) n = 2, progressive disease (PD)/Death n = 9), and after a median follow-up of 32.9 months the median OS was 54.5 months (95% CI: 17.4-not reached) from transplantation. Fifty-five patients had CAR T-cell therapy for RT, response was captured for 51 (92.7%) patients and ORR was 62.7% (CR n = 23, PR n = 9, PD/Death n = 19), and after a median follow-up of 15.3 months the median OS was 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.6\u201320.7) from CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nOn multivariable analysis, RT-Prior CLL treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 2.08, 95% CI 1.41\u20133.07, p = 0.0002), older age (HR for 5 year increase 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30, p < 0.0001), CK in CLL compartment (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.13-3.10, p = 0.01), and higher LDH (HR for 2-fold increase 1.35, 95% CI 1.19-1.53, p < 0.0001) all at RT diagnosis were found to be independently associated with shorter OS. Trisomy 12 in CLL at RT diagnosis was found to be associated with a longer OS (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.73, p = 0.0014) (Supplemental Table 3). These results aligned with the complete case univariable and bivariable sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Table 4).\n\nPrevious studies of outcomes in patients with RT primarily included patients who received CIT for their CLL at some point prior to RT, and the median OS ranged from 9\u201312 months [2, 4, 5]. To our knowledge, this is the largest analyzed cohort of patients with RT who were treated without CIT for CLL. Median OS for the total cohort was 25.8 months, but for those patients who had received prior non-CIT treatment, the median OS was markedly shorter at only 12.3 months.\n\nWe found differences in prognostic variables among the three groups analyzed, where RT patients who had prior CLL treatment were more likely to have higher LDH, harbor CK, TP53 disruption, have clonally related disease, and be non-GCB. These findings suggest that treatment either selects for higher risk RT, or that patients requiring treatment for their CLL are more likely to harbor a higher-risk RT clone. In this study, only 28.8% of patients had clonal relationship testing performed. This highlights the need to promote the testing of this relevant prognostic variable in RT [7]. Prior CLL treatment, CK in the CLL at RT diagnosis and higher LDH were independent risk factors for shorter OS, all of which have previously been described as prognostic of survival for patients with RT [5, 8, 9]. TP53 disruption has been associated with worse outcomes in RT [5, 10, 11], but in this study it was only found to be significant on univariable analysis. Interestingly, trisomy 12 was associated with improved survival in our analysis. Trisomy 12 has been linked to the development of RT [12], and in one study was associated with shorter survival [13].\n\nThe optimal treatment for RT has not been established. We did not find any specific front-line regimen to appear to be associated with an improvement in OS. However, we did observe that patients treated with CIT had higher response rates than patients treated with targeted agents without CIT. This could be clinically important, as those who achieve CR could be considered candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which has been associated with prolonged survival in our analysis and others [14, 15]. Patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a prolonged median OS of 54.5 months. This is contrast to those patients who received CAR T-cell therapy who experienced a median OS of 9.0 months. Given this data it is important to consider an allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with RT whenever feasible.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The wealth of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity heart surgeon nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has swelled in part from for-profit health care companies over which he'd wield significant power if confirmed, according to a newly filed government ethics report.\n\nIn the filing, the 64-year-old former talk show host pledged to divest from those companies within three months of confirmation and said that until then, he wouldn't participate in any matter that could affect his investments.\n\nOz's net worth is between $98 million and $332 million, according to an analysis of the disclosure, which lists asset values in ranges but does not give precise dollar figures. Oz shot to fame and made millions off his daytime talk show. His most recent disclosure shows he also holds millions of dollars worth of shares in health insurance, fertility, pharmaceutical and vitamin companies.\n\nOz said in the filing that he will sell off parts of his significant and diverse investment portfolio, which ranges from retail giants such as Walmart to tech companies such as Apple.\n\nHis roster of investments includes up to $5 million in Inception Fertility, a company with a network of fertility clinics; a maximum of $100,000 with pharmaceutical giant AbbVie; and as much as $600,000 with the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group. He also holds up to $5 million with Nvidia, an artificial intelligence company that outfits hospitals.\n\nAnd his work as an adviser for iHerb, a website that sells health and beauty supplements, has earned Oz as much as $25 million in company stock, which he pledged to forfeit \u201cas soon as practicable but not later than 90 days after confirmation.\" He indicated he would also resign from his position with the company if confirmed.\n\nHis investments touch nearly every aspect of the health care system, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cHe has his fingerprints and his financing all over the health care system, from services to artificial intelligence to medical products,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cIt seems to me that those conflicts are so intertwined in his and his families finances, I don\u2019t know how he disentangles himself from it all.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Oz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Oz would be responsible for the programs that more than half the country relies on for health insurance: Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMedicaid provides nearly-free health care coverage to millions of the poorest children and adults in the U.S. while Medicare gives older Americans and the disabled access to health insurance. The Affordable Care Act is the Obama-era program that offers health insurance plans to millions of Americans who do not qualify for government-assisted health insurance, but do not get insurance through their employer.\n\nAs the administrator for CMS, Oz would make decisions on how the government covers procedures, hospital stays and medications in these programs and the reimbursement rates doctors and other providers get for their services.\n\nOz ran a failed 2022 bid to represent Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate as a Republican. During the campaign, he called to expand Medicare Advantage, the increasingly popular version of Medicare that's run by private insurers who have been accused of defrauding the government by billions of dollars through the program.\n\nBefore his turn to politics, Oz was a renowned heart surgeon at Columbia University. He rose to fame on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d with appearances where he discussed weight-loss diets, Botox and anti-aging techniques. Eventually, he landed his own show, which was popular but attracted deep criticism from the scientific community. Some colleagues at Columbia University called for his removal over claims he made about products on TV. Senators, too, scolded him during a 2014 hearing over the weight-loss drugs he promoted\n\nHe has formed a kinship, though, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was sworn in as the nation's top health official last week. Kennedy and Oz have shared concerns over pesticides and unhealthy foods.\n\nOz's confirmation hearing to become CMS administrator has not been scheduled.\n\n___\n\nhttp://accesswdun.com/article/2025/2/1287426",

The monoclonal antibody component of the ADC is engineered to recognize and bind to specific antigens found on the surface of cancer cells. Once bound, the ADC is internalized into the cancer cell, where the cytotoxic drug is released, delivering a highly targeted dose of chemotherapy directly to the tumor. This approach helps to minimize the systemic toxicity commonly associated with traditional chemotherapy, as the drug is delivered specifically to cancer cells rather than affecting healthy tissues.\n\nThe development of ADCs has led to significant advancements in cancer treatment, particularly for tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies. ADCs are designed to overcome some of the challenges in cancer therapy, such as off-target toxicity and drug resistance, by ensuring that the cytotoxic payload is only active inside cancer cells. However, the design and optimization of ADCs remain complex, involving careful selection of the monoclonal antibody, the cytotoxic drug, and the linker that connects them. Ongoing research is focused on improving the stability, potency, and selectivity of ADCs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects.\n\nAntibody-drug Conjugates Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nAs per DelveInsight analysis, the total incident cases of TNBC in the United States comprised nearly 45K cases in 2023.

            "content": "Dividend stocks have been the backbone of market returns for over a century, contributing roughly two-thirds of total returns since 1900, according to a report by the Hartford Funds. Companies that consistently raise their dividends have been particularly strong performers, thanks to their ability to generate steady revenue growth and strong free cash flows across different market cycles.\n\nThese dividend growers share several important characteristics that make them compelling long-term investments. They typically maintain conservative payout ratios, possess durable competitive advantages in their respective industries, and generate reliable cash flows that can support continued dividend increases.\n\nThis financial strength means they can often maintain and grow their dividends even during economic downturns, providing investors with steady income growth regardless of market conditions.\n\nHere's a closer look at two standout dividend growers with proven track records of delivering exceptional shareholder returns.\n\nOne of pharma's fastest dividend growers\n\nAbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) is an immunology powerhouse. While its blockbuster Humira faces biosimilar competition, the company's newer drugs Rinvoq and Skyrizi are delivering impressive results. Management's combined sales forecast for these medications has recently been raised to $31 billion by 2027, up from the previous target of $27 billion.\n\nFor income investors, AbbVie's dividend growth stands out. The company has increased its payout at a 13.6% annual rate over the past 10 years, making it one of the fastest dividend growers among major pharmaceutical companies. The drugmaker's current 3.3% yield, more than double the yield of the S&P 500, offers an attractive income stream for shareholders.\n\nWhile the 259% payout ratio might raise eyebrows, this elevated level isn't uncommon for pharmaceutical companies given the cyclical nature of drug development. With Skyrizi and Rinvoq achieving 51% and 50% growth respectively in 2024, and their combined sales expected to grow at more than a 20% compound annual rate through 2027, AbbVie's dividend looks well-supported by its blistering growth trajectory.\n\nSpeaking to this point, the drugmaker's broader outlook remains solid, with 2024 revenue growing 4.6% on a constant-currency basis and 2025 guidance pointing to 5.7% growth. While AbbVie faces some headwinds, including pressure on its oncology drug Imbruvica and a recent setback in its neuroscience program, the company's strong transition in immunology and early stage pipeline, including potential treatments for ulcerative colitis, demonstrate the strength of its all-important innovation engine.\n\nOne of the financial sector's wide-moat dividend growers\n\nS&P Global (SPGI -0.38%) is a powerhouse in financial markets, providing essential credit ratings, benchmarks, and data analytics. The company's wide economic moat stems from the high switching costs and network effects built into its business model -- once a benchmark is established in the financial markets, it's extremely difficult to displace.\n\nFor dividend growth investors, S&P Global offers an impressive track record. The company has grown its dividend at an 11.7% annual rate over the prior 10 years while maintaining a conservative 29% payout ratio. While the current 0.7% yield might seem modest, the company's growth trajectory suggests room for continued dividend expansion.\n\nThe company's outlook remains robust, with fourth-quarter revenue growing 14% to $3.59 billion, driven by a 54% surge in ratings transaction revenue. Management expects continued growth in 2025, with the ratings business projected to grow 3% to 5% despite some shifts in the issuance mix. The company's market intelligence segment is also showing strength, particularly in enterprise solutions, which grew 16% in the most recent quarter.\n\nS&P Global's recent performance is particularly impressive for a company of its size. Its combination of strong growth, wide moat, and consistent dividend increases makes S&P Global an attractive option for investors seeking reliable dividend growth backed by a durable business model.\n\nGood for investors\n\nCompanies that consistently raise their dividends often share essential traits: durable competitive advantages, strong cash flows, and the ability to grow through various market conditions. Both AbbVie and S&P Global exemplify these characteristics, offering investors different paths to dividend growth -- AbbVie through pharmaceutical innovation and higher current yield, and S&P Global through its entrenched market position and lower but well-covered payout.",

            "content": "Biopharma is being battered by patent headwinds that are the strongest they\u2019ve been in nearly 15 years.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a report last month from analyst firm William Blair, which estimates that from 2023 through the end of 2025, nearly 50 products will have lost patent protections\u2014in turn eroding the aggregate sales of these drugs from $162.8 billion in 2025 to just $67 billion in 2029.\n\n\u201cWe believe the biggest headwind to large pharma revenue growth over the next five years is loss of exclusivity,\u201d William Blair analysts wrote in the report.\n\nThe patent cliff is exactly that: a cliff. Take AbbVie\u2019s Humira, for instance. The immunology juggernaut is one of the most high-profile drugs to go off patent in recent years after topping the list of pharma\u2019s highest selling drugs for much of its blissful patent-protected period. AbbVie recorded sales of $21.24 billion in 2022. The year after, sales were $14.04 billion and last year just $8.99 billion. To patch the hole, AbbVie has leaned on its new immunology stars, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which brought in $11.72 billion and $5.97 billion globally in 2024, respectively.\n\nFive industry powerhouses will see the same challenge in the coming years, as potential biosimilar and generic competition threaten sales. According to William Blair, the loss will affect assets that accounted for more than 30% of the collective revenues from Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Regeneron in 2024. In this article, BioSpace looks at five pharma players\u2014and one honorable mention\u2014facing the greatest loss of sales in the coming years and how they\u2019re planning to replace the revenue.\n\nMerck Set to Lose Exclusivity for Keytruda, Seminal PD-1 Inhibitor\n\nAssets at risk: Lenvima (2025), Januvia and Janumet (2026), Lynparza (2027), Gardasil/Gardasil 9 (2028) and Keytruda (2028)\n\nPerhaps the most talked about patent cliff belongs to Merck\u2019s blockbuster cancer therapy Keytruda, one of the industry\u2019s highest-earning assets with more than $29 billion in sales last year. Keytruda faces a key patent expiry in 2028.\n\nTo help shore up the drug\u2019s sales, Merck is gearing up for regulatory discussions about its subcutaneous formulation of the PD-1 blocker. If successful, the product\u2019s launch could lessen the grade of the patent cliff the company inevitably faces.\n\nAside from subcutaneous Keytruda, Merck is leaning on its pulmonary hypertension therapy Winrevair, which according to William Blair will be the pharma\u2019s \u201cmain driver of growth,\u201d expecting $4.9 billion in sales in 2029.\n\nOther Merck assets set to encounter patent headwinds in the coming years include the cancer drug Lenvima later this year, Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in 2028, the diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet in 2026 and the cancer therapy Lynparza in 2027.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb Cuts Costs and Jobs in Face of Three Impending Cliffs\n\nAssets at risk: Yervoy (2025), Eliquis (2026) and Opdivo (2028)\n\nAs in the case of Regeneron, BMS is set to lose key protections for one its most valuable assets. Eliquis, an anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke, made over $13 billion in 2024.\n\nAhead of the loss of exclusivity in 2026, several generics have already secured the FDA\u2019s approval. These include copycats from Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Micro Labs Limited, which the FDA greenlit in December 2019. BMS and its partner Pfizer have put up a strong legal effort to stall these generics, securing a critical court win in August 2020 that would let them keep the market to themselves until 2026.\n\nStill, the pressure is on for BMS to find alternative sources of revenue, especially because its cancer therapy Yervoy faces loss of exclusivity even sooner\u2014this year. Yervoy brought in $2.5 billion for the pharma in 2024.\n\nAccording to William Blair, BMS is unprepared for the cliffs its facing, \u201cdespite several recent notable acquisitions, there is not much to get excited about in Bristol Myers\u2019 late-stage pipeline,\u201d the firm wrote. BMS\u2019s most standout asset is the PD-1 blocker Opdivo, which likewise faces key expiries in 2028, though a recently approved subcutaneous formulation could help buoy growth through this point and beyond.\n\nInstead of beefing up its pipeline, BMS has chosen to weather the storm with cost-cuts. In April 2024, the pharma kicked off a sweeping realignment program\u2014which includes around 2,200 layoffs\u2014with an eye toward saving up to $1.5 billion through 2025. In its full-year 2024 business report earlier this month, the company tacked another $2 billion to the cost-cutting goal, which it hopes to realize through 2027.\n\nEliquis Tops Pfizer\u2019s List of Patent Problems\n\nAsset at risk: Prevnar (2026), Ibrance (2027), Xtandi (2027) and Eliquis (2028)\n\nEliquis\u2019 loss of exclusivity could be even more painful for Pfizer, the prospects of which William Blair called \u201cbleak\u201d in its report.\n\nIn 2024, Eliquis emerged as Pfizer\u2019s top-performing asset, growing 10% year-on-year operationally to bring in $7.4 billion. But the product faces loss of exclusivity in April 2028, with several generics waiting to eat into its sales. Compounding the company\u2019s revenue problem is the fact that Eliquis was named among the first 10 drugs subject to price negotiations with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) prescribed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with the discounted negotiated price to go into effect in 2026.\n\nPfizer has several other assets that are set to lose key patent protections in the coming years, too, including the pneumonia shot Prevnar in 2026 and the cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, both in 2027.\n\nErosion in sales is just one of Pfizer\u2019s problems, which also include an activist investor jockeying for control and an unreliable COVID-19 market dynamics. There\u2019s also what William Blair called an \u201cunderwhelming legacy pipeline.\u201d\n\nSeemingly aware of its precarious position, Pfizer sought to shore up its bottom line with an aggressive and sweeping cost-cutting measure. The savings program announced in October 2023 was designed to help the company lower its spend by $3.5 billion last year, while a more recent round in May 2024 set a $1.7 billion savings target by the end of 2027.\n\nAside from cost-cuts, the pharma is also banking on several 2025 catalysts\u2014including up to four regulatory decisions\u2014that could position the pharma for better growth in coming years, according to its fourth-quarter business report. Commercially, Pfizer is leaning heavily on its antibody-drug conjugate Padcev, which CEO Albert Bourla told investors was \u201can important growth driver.\u201d\n\nThe company is expecting additional data for Padcev later this year that could open a path for approval in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. If approved, that indication \u201cwould nearly triple the total addressable patients in the U.S.,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Plan for Reaching $80B in Revenue Despite Expiries\n\nAsset at risk: Farxiga (2025), Soliris (2025)\n\nIn May 2024, AstraZeneca unveiled an ambitious plan to deliver $80 billion in total annual revenue by 2030\u2014a goal that could be crippled when Farxiga loses key patent protections later this year. In 2024, the drug brought in $7.7 billion, corresponding to 31% year-on-year growth at constant currencies.\n\nSoliris, a key rare disease asset that brought in nearly $2.6 billion in 2024, is also facing loss of exclusivity and is expected to face biosimilar challenge this year.\n\nStill, the pharma appears well-positioned to hit its 2030 target. As per William Blair, AstraZeneca has done a \u201ccommendable job\u201d of building out its product portfolio, particularly in the oncology space. Enhertu, a Daiichi Sankyo-partnered antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), recently won broad approval in breast cancer. Enhertu will retain crucial patent protections past 2030, according to William Blair.\n\nOther cancer standouts include Tagrisso and Imfinzi, which respectively made $6.58 billion and $4.72 billion in 2024.\n\nAstraZeneca also boasts its clinical pipeline, which could bear fruit in the near-future. In a media call ahead for the pharma\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report, Chief Finance Officer Aradhana Sarin called 2025 an \u201cunprecedented catalyst-rich period\u201d for AstraZeneca.\n\nIn particular, the company is awaiting key readouts for several of its products, including not only Enhertu and Imfinzi but also the recently approved Datroway and asthma treatment Fasenra. AstraZeneca is also expecting crucial data for new assets such as camizestrant for different cancers and baxdrostat for hypertension.\n\n\u201cThe value of our pipeline has been increasing, and now we have more than 90 late-stage studies underway, with an average peak-year revenue potential of over $1 billion,\u201d Sarin said.\n\nNovartis Struggles to Maintain Entresto\u2019s Exclusivity\n\nAssets at risk: Entresto (2025), Xolair (2025), Jakafi (2026), Cosentyx (2029) and Tafinlar (2030)\n\nNovartis\u2019 patent problems escalated in 2024. The heart failure drug Entresto, which made $7.8 billion last year, is set to lose market exclusivity in July 2025. The pharma started efforts to guard its place in the market as early as September 2022, when it filed a citizen Pptition to the FDA asking the regulator not to approve drug applications referencing Entresto and specific patents related to it. But last July, the FDA denied the petition, noting that it is possible for generic drugs to sidestep Entresto\u2019s patents with labeling tweaks.\n\nThe same month, the FDA signed off on MSN Pharmaceuticals\u2019 generic version of Entresto. Those decisions have since opened a legal saga for Novartis, which most recently secured a last-minute stay against MSN\u2019s copycat, preventing its market entry while the pharma\u2019s patent complaint remains open.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call last month, company executives expressed confidence that Novartis would be able to smoothly weather Entresto\u2019s loss of exclusivity in mid-2025. The company expects to \u201csecure pediatric exclusivity\u201d for Entresto, which could potentially help soften the blow of generics this year, CEO Vas Narasimhan said during the call.\n\nAside from the heart failure drug, Novartis is also facing down patent expirations for Xolair in 2025, Jakafi in 2026, Cosentyx in 2029 and Tafinlar in 2030. Ilaris, indicated for auto-inflammatory diseases, lost key protections last year, while chronic myeloid leukemia drug Tasigna became open to generic erosion in 2023.\n\nMuch of Novartis\u2019 resilience through the patent expiries will come from fiscal discipline, Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch explained during the call.\n\nHonorable Mention: Regeneron\u2019s High-Dose Eylea Not Making Up for LOE\n\nAsset at risk: Eylea (2024)\n\nRegeneron is already in the throes of a major patent expiry for its blockbuster eye disease drug Eylea, which in 2024 was the pharma\u2019s top-performing asset with $5.97 billion in sales in the U.S. But last May, the company lost key protections for the drug, thereby opening it up to considerable copycat competition.\n\nAnd of these, there are several. The same month Eylea went off patent, the FDA signed off on two interchangeable biosimilars, Biocon Biologics\u2019 Yesafili and Samsung Bioepis and Biogen\u2019s Opuviz. A few months later, Novartis spinoff Sandoz also won the regulator\u2019s go-ahead for its own biosimilar called Enzeevu.\n\nTo help protect Eylea\u2019s place in the market, Regeneron has taken many of its competitors to court. In December 2023, the pharma sued Samsung Bio for alleged patent infringement. Regeneron also has a case against Sandoz, seeking to block the generics developer from marketing its biosimilar.\n\nThe pharma has also developed a high-dose (HD) version of Eylea to keep the product\u2019s competitive edge. The product earned the FDA greenlight in August 2023, but uptake has been slow. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Eylea HD\u2019s sales came in at $305 million, below analyst expectations of $336 million.\n\nIn the pharma\u2019s earnings call, CEO Leonard Schleifer urged investors to \u201clook beyond\u201d its Eylea franchise, noting that \u201cour strategy is not to be solely dependent on any one thing.\u201d In 2025, Regeneron is looking forward to the launch of its anti-IL-4/IL-13 antibody Dupixent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as several key data readouts.",

The study has been published in the SCIE-indexed international journal Advances in Therapy.\n\nCelltrion\u2019s phase 3 interchangeability study of Yuflyma, a high-concentration Humira biosimilar, has been published in Advances in Therapy, reinforcing its clinical equivalence and market competitiveness.\n\nThe study assessed the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Yuflyma in comparison with Humira among 367 Estonian patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nThe results demonstrated that patients who underwent multiple switches between Yuflyma and Humira showed pharmacokinetic equivalence to those who remained on Humira. Also, the study confirmed comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles between the two treatment groups.\n\nWith this publication, Celltrion believes it has further validated Yuflyma\u2019s clinical equivalence to the reference product, reinforcing its competitive edge in the global market.\n\nPreviously, the company had presented the study findings at various dermatology conferences, including the 2024 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress and the 2024 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference (FCDC) in the U.S., garnering significant interest from healthcare professionals worldwide.\n\nCelltrion submitted a supplemental application to the U.S. FDA in January 2024 to secure interchangeability status for Yuflyma. If granted, this designation is expected to enhance prescriber confidence in switching patients between Humira and Yuflyma without additional approval.\n\nGiven the U.S. prescription system\u2019s reliance on active ingredient-based prescribing rather than brand names, the company anticipates that securing interchangeability status will positively impact its market penetration in the country.\n\n\u201cWith the publication of Yuflyma\u2019s interchangeability study in a globally recognized journal, we expect it to serve as a strong reference for prescriptions in key markets, including the U.S.,\u201d a Celltrion official said.\n\nYuflyma, developed by Celltrion, is the world\u2019s first high-concentration biosimilar of Humira. It offers advantages over the low-concentration version by reducing the injection volume by half and eliminating citrate, which can cause pain during administration.\n\nThe biosimilar is available in three dosage forms\u201420mg/0.2ml, 40mg/0.4ml, and 80mg/0.8ml\u2014across nations.\n\nHumira, the original reference biologic by AbbVie, generated approximately $14.4 billion in global sales in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for over 84 percent of its total revenue, amounting to $12.16 billion.",

This progressive condition leads to symptoms such as abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. The exact cause of Crohn\u2019s Disease remains unclear, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors.\n\nThe disease presents in different forms, including ileocolitis (affecting the ileum and colon), ileitis (limited to the ileum), gastroduodenal Crohn\u2019s Disease (impacting the stomach and duodenum), jejunoileitis (small intestine inflammation), and Crohn\u2019s colitis (restricted to the colon). Complications such as strictures, fistulas, abscesses, and bowel obstructions can occur, requiring advanced medical intervention.\n\nTreatment options for Crohn\u2019s Disease aim to manage inflammation, alleviate symptoms, and prevent flare-ups. Common therapies include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics (such as TNF inhibitors and integrin inhibitors), and JAK inhibitors. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged portions of the intestine. Ongoing research focuses on new targeted therapies, gut microbiome modulation, and personalized treatment approaches to improve long-term outcomes for Crohn\u2019s Disease patients.\n\nLearn more about Crohn\u2019s Disease treatment algorithms in different geographies, and patient journeys.

Unlike solid tumors, these cancers can circulate throughout the body via the bloodstream, making early detection challenging. Recent research highlights the role of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a pre-cancerous condition where mutated blood stem cells expand, increasing the risk of hematological malignancies and cardiovascular diseases. Advanced therapies like CAR-T cell treatment, which reprograms the patient's immune cells to target cancer, have revolutionized treatment, particularly for relapsed or refractory cases. Interestingly, hematological cancers are also influenced by the gut microbiome, with studies suggesting that specific bacterial compositions can impact treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.Here, we've just put out a new study report on the Hematological Cancers Market Demand 2024-2032 that gives a thorough and organised look at the size of the market.

            "content": "AbbVie's ABBV short percent of float has risen 3.88% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 18.93 million shares sold short, which is 1.07% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.73 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nAbbVie Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for AbbVie has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing AbbVie's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, AbbVie's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.31%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.",

            "content": "Investing in the stock market is one of the most effective ways to build long-term wealth, but navigating the vast sea of investment strategies can feel overwhelming. One of the most reliable methods to generate passive income from your investments is dividend investing.\n\nUnlike chasing high yields alone, dividend-growth stocks offer a powerful combination of steady income, capital appreciation, and resilience through market cycles. With that in mind, here are three dividend-growth stocks to consider adding to your portfolio: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), Energy Transfer LP (ET), and Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP).\n\nHistorically, dividend-growing companies have outperformed non-dividend payers, delivering higher returns with lower volatility. A study by Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds found that over the past 50 years (1973-2023), dividend payers generated an impressive 9.2% annual return, more than double the 4.3% return of non-dividend stocks. This steady compounding effect can significantly enhance wealth accumulation, especially when reinvesting dividends.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates steady at 4.25% \u2013 4.50% and no immediate cuts expected, dividend stocks remain attractive. A stable economy favors strong dividend growers, especially as slightly elevated inflation is expected to ease. If rate cuts materialize in late 2025, dividend-paying stocks could become even more appealing, offering steady income and capital appreciation in a shifting market.\n\nGiven these favorable trends, let\u2019s examine the fundamentals of the above-mentioned dividend growth stocks in detail:\n\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\n\nABBV is a global diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company engaged in manufacturing and selling medications and therapies. It offers a comprehensive product portfolio across Immunology, Oncology, Neuroscience, Eye Care, Aesthetics, and Other Specialties.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, ABBV announced the acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to strengthen its immunology pipeline further. The deal includes Nimble\u2019s lead asset, an investigational oral peptide IL-23R inhibitor currently in preclinical development for psoriasis, as well as a pipeline of innovative oral peptide candidates targeting various autoimmune diseases with significant unmet needs.\n\nAdditionally, ABBV will gain access to Nimble\u2019s proprietary peptide synthesis, screening, and optimization platform, designed to enable the discovery and optimization of oral peptide therapeutics.\n\nOn October 30, the company\u2019s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from $1.55 to $1.64 per share, which was paid to its shareholders on February 14, 2025. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.8%, continuing ABBV\u2019s strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend.\n\nIt pays an annual dividend of $6.56, which translates to a yield of 3.40% at the current share price. Its four-year average dividend yield is 3.86%. Moreover, the company\u2019s dividend payouts have increased at an impressive CAGR of 7.5% over the past five years.\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter (ended December 31, 2024), ABBV\u2019s net revenue increased 5.6% year-over-year to $15.10 billion, while the company\u2019s Neuroscience segment reported net revenue of $2.51 billion, indicating a 19.8% growth from the prior-year quarter.

ABBV\u2019s adjusted net earnings for the quarter came in at $3.84 billion and $2.16 per share.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $12.93 billion for the fiscal first quarter (ending March 2025) represents a 5% increase year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $2.52 for the same period indicates a 9.1% improvement year-over-year. The company has an impressive surprise history; it surpassed the consensus revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nABBV shares gained 19.4% over the past nine months and 8.5% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $192.87.\n\nABBV\u2019s strong fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of A, which translates to a Strong Buy in our proprietary rating system.

The deal, via its Oasis Pipeline, will provide up to 450,000 MMBtu per day, enough to generate 1.2 GW of power for at least 10 years, pending a final investment decision later this year.\n\nThis marks ET\u2019s first direct gas supply deal for a data center, with more agreements expected as demand for AI-driven infrastructure grows.\n\nOn January 27, ET increased its quarterly cash distribution to $0.3250 per common unit for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 3.2% year-over-year.

Also, the company reported a net income of $1.45 billion or $0.29 per common unit for the same quarter. Further, ET\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased 7.8% from the year-ago value to $3.88 billion. Also, its distributable cash flow was up 2.4% from the prior year to $1.97 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect ET\u2019s revenue for the first quarter (ending March 2025) to increase 3.4% year-over-year to $22.37 billion. Meanwhile, its EPS for the same quarter is expected to grow 18.3% from the prior year to $0.38.\n\nThe stock has soared 25.2% over the past six months and 41.7% over the past year to close the last trading session at $19.99.\n\nET\u2019s promising outlook is reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of B, which translates to a Buy in our proprietary rating system.\n\nThe stock has an A grade for Momentum and a B for Value and Stability.

            "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.\n\nStory Continues",

These aseptic conditions during fill and finish operation are important to ensure the safety of the patients and maintain product quality. However, pharmaceutical manufacturers with limited funds and capacity may find it challenging to meet the needs of consumers due to the high cost of specialized equipment and qualified professionals for these jobs. Therefore, many stakeholders outsource their needs by contracting with service providers to ensure the development of quality products.Currently, contract fill-finish services are one of the most commonly outsourced services. Increasing demand for drugs in the global market and the advantages of contract manufacturing in reducing the overall investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing are the main factors boosting business growth. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic stimulated the development of COVID-19 vaccines, antiviral drugs, and other related pharmaceutical products. Vaccines & biologics require special manufacturing and fill & finish systems and procedures to maintain product quality and safety. Thus, covid-19 outbreak positively impacted the aseptic fill finish market.Some of the prominent players in the Aseptic Fill Finish Market are:\u2022 AbbVie Contract Manufacturing\u2022 Asymchem\u2022 Aenova\u2022 APL\u2022 BioPharma Solutions\u2022 BioReliance\u2022 Boehringer Ingelheim BioXcellence\u2022 Catalent Biologics\u2022 Charles River Laboratories\u2022 CordenPharma\u2022 Delpharm\u2022 Fareva\u2022 Fresenius Kabi\u2022 Glaxo SmithKline\u2022 Hetero Drugs\u2022 Intas Pharmaceuticals\u2022 Lonza\u2022 Pierre Fabre\u2022 Pfizer CentreOne\u2022 Plastikon Healthcare\u2022 Patheon\u2022 PiSA Farmaceutica\u2022 Recipharm\u2022 Wacker Biotech\u2022 Syngene\u2022 Sharp Services\u2022 Siegfried\u2022 Takara Bio\u2022 WuXi Biologics\u2022 Wockhardt\u2022 Other Prominent PlayersExpert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Market Dynamics:Drivers:The factors contributing to driving the aseptic fill-finish market are the high demand for outsourcing aseptic fill-finish services, the growing pipeline of drug products, in-house capacity constraints, technological developments, and increased awareness related to the benefits of aseptic fill-finish services.Many pharma, biopharma, and contract manufacturing organizations have adopted single-use fill-finish systems, specifically for biologics. For example, PreVAS (Syntegon Technology GmbH) is a pre-assembled and pre-sterilized disposable filling system for vials, syringes, cartridges, and ampoules. This is mainly because single-use eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming sterilization processes.Challenges:Aseptic fill-finish operations carry more risk than non-sterile processes. They require trained personnel, careful planning, and specialized facilities and equipment to perform the procedure. Maintaining a contamination-free environment is crucial as it can cause financial losses and affect patients' lives. Sterilization of components required for aseptic fill-finishing processes is also an additional step.Regional Trends:North America's aseptic fill finish market is projected to hold the second-highest revenue share after Asia Pacific. Factors contributing to this growth are rising demand for diagnostics, increasing pharma & biopharma companies, well-established industrial infrastructure, advancement in medical technologies, increasing collaborations and agreements, and improved developmental capabilities of the contract manufacturing companies in this region.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Key developments in the market:\u2022 In May 2023, CordenPharma announced its entry into the synthetic Oligonucleotide manufacturing arena in CordenPharma Colorado.

            "content": "AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) closed out a pivotal 2024 with an excellent fourth-quarter earnings report. For the period ended Dec. 31, the biopharmaceuticals giant delivered 6% sales growth and $2.12 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS), with both metrics exceeding initial guidance. Comments by management projected optimism for continued growth momentum into the new year.\n\nWith the shares kicking off 2025 with a solid 8% gain year to date, some investors may wonder -- can the rally keep going, and is AbbVie stock a buy right now? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe Skyrizi and Rinvoq boom\n\nAbbVie is recognized as a leading drugmaker with an extensive portfolio of therapeutics in fields such as immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and eye care. Additionally, the company commercializes the high-profile aesthetics brands Botox and Juvederm as anti-aging skin treatments. This diversification, coupled with a long history of innovation, is a big part of what makes AbbVie a blue chip stock and compelling investment opportunity.\n\nIn recent years, the company has struggled to navigate the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. for its landmark drug, Humira. This monoclonal antibody played a massive role in the company's success over the past decade as the best-in-class treatment for several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.\n\nIn early 2023, the expiration of key patents opened the door for biosimilar alternatives to enter the market. Humira sales in 2024 were $9 billion, down 58% from their peak.\n\nThe good news is that AbbVie has already found a replacement for Humira with two blockbuster drugs: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. While these drugs were developed for many of the same conditions as Humira, they work differently in the body. Studies have shown that they are more effective in treating certain autoimmune diseases, positioning them as superior successors.\n\nIn 2024, combined Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales reached $17.7 billion, up 51% year over year, reflecting accelerating global demand and ongoing market traction. Excluding the Humira platform, AbbVie sales increased by 18% last year compared to 2023, also driven by the strong performance from the neuroscience and oncology product portfolio.\n\nUltimately, the trends highlight AbbVie's ability to turn the page with a more positive long-term outlook.\n\nA growth runway for AbbVie\n\nThe expectation is for record total revenue in 2025 with a growth runway through the next decade. AbbVie believes Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales will climb to $24 billion this year and exceed $31 billion by 2029. The company's president and CEO, Robert A. Michael, commented on these themes during the last earnings conference call:\n\nWe are well-positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the U.S. Humira loss of exclusivity (LOE). And given that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade, we have a clear runway to grow for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue average growth through 2029.\n\nFor 2025, the company is targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) between $12.12 and $12.32, representing a 21% increase from $10.12 in 2024. AbbVie is also guiding for a \"mid-single digit revenue growth,\" which also captures the contribution from a pipeline of new product candidates in late-stage clinical trials with expected approvals and regulatory submissions this year.\n\nIs AbbVie stock a buy?\n\nThere is a case to be made that AbbVie's outlook is as strong as ever. The stock currently presents a good balance between growth and value.\n\nShares trade at under 16 times the company's 2025 consensus EPS as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This level is particularly compelling, given its expected earnings momentum and the number of potential catalysts from the research and development (R&D) pipeline. The stock also offers a 3.3% dividend yield through a $1.55 quarterly payment. Notably, AbbVie's consecutive 53-year history of growing its dividend places it in the exclusive group of stocks known as \"Dividend Kings.\"\n\nFor investors with a long-term horizon, now could be a great time to add shares of this healthcare sector leader to a diversified portfolio.",

They have been compiled in the ascending order of the hedge fund\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024. To provide readers with a more holistic analysis of each stock, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each company using data from over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds show interest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the latest top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q3: 70\n\nLMCG\u2019s Equity Stake: $29.72 Million\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a leading pharmaceutical company based in North Chicago, Illinois, recognized as one of the largest biomedical firms by revenue. The company\u2019s flagship product, Humira, is widely used to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) was established as an independent entity following Abbott Laboratories\u2019 decision in 2011 to separate its pharmaceutical division into a standalone company. The spin-off was completed on January 1, 2013, and AbbVie began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ABBV the following day. With a workforce of over 50,000 employees in more than 70 countries, AbbVie\u2019s products address 75 medical conditions and are distributed in more than 175 countries. The company also collaborates with over 250 biotechnology firms, universities, nonprofits, and government organizations to drive medical innovation.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) demonstrated strong financial performance for the quarter ended December 2024. The reported net revenue of $15.1 billion for the quarter, demonstrating a 5.6% increase year-over-year indicates solid business growth. However, the earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $2.16 against $2.79 for the same quarter in 2023, missing analyst estimates of $2.26 by 4.3%.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s top-selling drug, Humira, generated $187 billion in revenue for over two decades, but its patent expiration in January 2023 led to a 32% decline in Humira sales and a 7% drop in total company revenue due to similar medicines emerging in the market. Despite this, CEO Rob Michael stated at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference that only 20% of patients have switched to the alternatives, with many transitioning to AbbVie\u2019s newer immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These treatments have already gained significant traction, capturing 50% of the market for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indications. With Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributing approximately $5 billion in growth, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\u2019s strategic shift towards innovative immunology treatments allows for the company\u2019s strong long-term performance despite Humira\u2019s decline.\n\nLMCG owned 167,256 shares of the company as of Q4 2024, with a total value of $29.72 million, making it the stock with the 8th largest stake in Munder\u2019s highly diversified portfolio. By the end of the third quarter, 68 funds out of the 900 funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) worth over $2.58 billion, up from 67 funds by the end of Q2.\n\nPolaris Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding AbbVie Inc.

The masking aspect is designed to allow the molecule to activate within the tumor microenvironment while minimizing systemic toxicity. While details on the targets of the collaboration are sparse, the duo will be focused on antibody-based, next-generation immunotherapies.\n\nShares of Xilio soared 175% Wednesday in pre-market trading following the announcement.\n\nSince its blockbuster biologic Humira lost patent protection in 2023, AbbVie has been rapidly expanding its oncology portfolio hand over fist with deals, and 2025 has been increasingly focused on T cell therapeutics.\n\nIn January, AbbVie expanded its collaboration with AbCellera to include the discovery of T cell engagers for tumor targets. AbCellera will lead discovery, leaving AbbVie with the right to discover and commercialize antibodies resulting from the therapeutics. Financial details were kept confidential.\n\nThe same day, the pharma giant announced a license agreement to develop Simcere Zaiming\u2019s SIM0500\u2014a T cell engager polyspecific antibody targeting GPRC5D, BCMA and CD3 currently in Phase I trials for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In addition to an undisclosed upfront payment, the Shanghhai-based biopharma is eligible to receive option fees and milestone payments of just over $1 billion plus royalties on net sales outside of the Greater China territory, if the drug is approved.",

These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity and at lower doses.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\nBOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic is contraindicated in the presence of infection at the proposed injection site(s) and in individuals with known hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the formulation.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nSeek immediate medical attention if respiratory, speech, or swallowing difficulties occur. The potency Units of BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic are not equivalent to other preparations of botulinum toxin products. Potential serious adverse reactions have been reported after BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic injections for unapproved uses. Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment. Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment of BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (eg, curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic may be potentiated.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nThere are no studies or adequate data from postmarketing surveillance on the developmental risk associated with use of BOTOX\u00ae Cosmetic in pregnant women.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nSome statements in this news release are, or may be considered, forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: XLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and developing tumor-activated immuno-oncology therapies for people living with cancer, today announced three wholly-owned preclinical programs for masked T cell engagers targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 (STEAP1). In addition, as announced earlier today, Xilio entered into a collaboration, license and option agreement with AbbVie leveraging Xilio\u2019s proprietary tumor-activation technology and platform to discover and develop novel tumor-activated immunotherapies, including masked T cell engagers. Under the collaboration, Xilio will receive $52.0 million in upfront payments and be eligible for additional option-related fees and milestones, as well as tiered royalties.\n\n\u201cToday, we are excited to announce the next phase of Xilio\u2019s tumor-activation platform with multiple internal masked T cell engager programs, as well as a multi-program collaboration with AbbVie,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Russo, Pharm.D., president and chief executive officer of Xilio. \u201cT cell engagers have demonstrated meaningful clinical activity, yet many promising targets for solid tumors remain out of reach due to toxicity limitations. Leveraging our clinically-validated masking technology, we aim to lead the next wave of innovation in cancer immunotherapy by developing masked T cell engagers designed to improve tolerability through tumor-selective activation. In addition, we are able to incorporate co-stimulatory signaling into our T cell engager designs with the goal of further enhancing T cell activation, persistence and anti-tumor activity. We look forward to collaborating with AbbVie as we advance our pipeline of novel tumor-activated immunotherapies.\u201d\n\nMasked T Cell Engager Programs\n\nT cell engagers are designed to redirect immune effector cells against cancer cells by simultaneously binding to a specific tumor-associated antigen expressed on the cancer cells and the T cell receptor complex on T cells, resulting in T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. To date, T cell engagers have demonstrated significant promise as cancer immunotherapies in a variety of advanced solid tumors, but their potential has been limited by toxicity.\n\nXilio is leveraging its proprietary, clinically-validated tumor-activation platform to advance a pipeline of wholly-owned, novel masked T cell engager molecules with conditional half-life modulation designed to enable potent, localized T cell activation and tumor cell destruction together with an improved therapeutic index. These programs include bispecific molecules designed using Xilio\u2019s advanced tumor-activated cell engager (ATACR) format, which consists of a T cell engager with a masked CD3 targeting domain, and tri-specific molecules designed using Xilio\u2019s selective effector-enhanced cell engager (SEECR) format. The SEECR format builds upon the ATACR format by adding co-stimulatory signaling designed to further enhance potency and T cell activation.\n\nXilio is currently advancing three wholly-owned preclinical programs for masked T cell engager molecules targeting the following tumor-associated antigens: PSMA, CLDN18.2 and STEAP1.\n\nPSMA has demonstrated potential as a T cell engager target for prostate cancer. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its PSMA program in the ATACR format in the third quarter of 2025 and submitting an investigational new drug application (IND) in the first quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLDN18.2 has broad potential as a T cell engager target for gastric, pancreatic, esophageal and lung cancers. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its CLDN18.2 program in the ATACR format in the fourth quarter of 2025 and submitting an IND in the second quarter of 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEAP1 has broad potential as a T cell engager target for prostate, colorectal and lung cancers. Xilio anticipates nominating a development candidate for its STEAP1 program in the SEECR format in the first half of 2026 and submitting an IND in the second half of 2027.\n\n\n\nAnticipated milestones beyond the first quarter of 2026 are subject to obtaining sufficient additional capital.\n\nCollaboration, License and Option Agreement with AbbVie\n\nUnder the terms of the collaboration, license and option agreement announced earlier today with AbbVie:\n\nXilio will receive $52.0 million in upfront payments, consisting of a cash payment of $42.0 million and an equity investment by AbbVie of $10.0 million in Xilio common stock at a premium.\n\n\n\n\n\nXilio granted AbbVie (i) an exclusive option for an initial program to discover and develop masked cell engager molecules (and subject to the terms of the agreement, the right to initiate up to two additional masked cell engager programs) and (ii) an exclusive license for a program to discover and develop a masked antibody-based immunotherapy.\n\n\n\n\n\nXilio will be eligible to receive up to approximately $2.1 billion in additional contingent payments, consisting of option-related fees and development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Xilio is also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging in the mid to high single digits on annual global net product sales for licensed products.\n\n\n\nFinancial Guidance\n\nBased on its current operating plans, Xilio anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the upfront payments under the agreement with AbbVie, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2026.\n\nInvestor Conference Call Information\n\n\n\nXilio will host a conference call and webcast today (Wednesday, February 12, 2025) at 8:30 am ET.

As a result, infections become harder to treat and the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death increases.\n\nMultidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern due to the high rates of morbidity and mortality they cause.\n\nEmblaveo, which is expected to be available in the US in the third quarter of 2025, is a fixed-dose combination of two components: aztreonam and avibactam. Aztreonam attaches to proteins on the surface of bacteria to prevent them from building their cell walls, which kills them. Meanwhile, avibactam blocks the action of enzymes that enable bacteria to break down and become resistant to aztreonam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\nAmong the data supporting the FDA\u2019s decision was clinical trial results from the phase 3 REVISIT study, which evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Emblaveo in serious infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, including Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing multidrug-resistant pathogens, for which there are limited or no treatment options.\n\nRoopal Thakkar, executive vice president, research and development, chief scientific officer, AbbVie, said: \u201cAs bacteria evolve, industry, government and clinical experts must work together to ensure that the infectious disease community has the tools to advance public health. We\u2019re proud to offer this important novel treatment option to urgently address the significant threat of AMR.\u201d\n\nAbbVie holds the rights to commercialise Emblaveo in the US and Canada, while Pfizer is responsible for the drug\u2019s commercialisation in all other areas.",

This appointment marks an advancement in the company's mission to dramatically improve women's contraceptive experiences and expand their options, particularly with intrauterine devices (IUDs).\n\nWith a career spanning over 40 years, including 38 years at Abbott/AbbVie, Poulos brings decades of success from a major player in the life sciences industry. He is a prominent member of the pharmaceutical community and played an instrumental role in negotiating numerous transformative acquisitions to build AbbVie's pharmaceutical portfolio.\n\n\"3Daughters is incredibly fortunate to bring John's wealth of experience to our Board of Directors. He is a skilled leader with a proven track record in identifying and licensing/acquiring innovation that has delivered groundbreaking therapies for patients which aligns with our mission and vision for women,\u201d said Mary Beth Cicero, CEO and Co-Founder of 3Daughters. \"His invaluable perspective will help 3Daughters expand into our next phase of growth for our game-changing IUD and Slider\u2122 system designed to address insertion pain. Our goal is to provide the best IUD experience for women and John's expertise will help us get closer to bringing innovative therapies into the market.\u201d\n\n\"I am honored to serve on the board of this revolutionary women's health company and help 3Daughters drive therapeutic innovation for patients, starting with an advanced IUD integrated system. I look forward to helping this experienced leadership team continue their success and execute on their strategic vision of developing groundbreaking healthcare solutions for women,\u201d said Poulos.\n\n3Daughters' mission is to advance women's health innovation with their targeted uterine delivery platform, starting with an advanced contraceptive option to provide women with the best IUD experience. With our first product, a frameless IUD and Slider\u2122 (inserter/retriever), 3Daughters is taking everything that's hated about the 50-year-old IUDs, revolutionizing it, and giving women hope and what they have long wanted - an improved option.\n\nAbout 3Daughters\u2122\n\n3Daughters is a clinical development company focused on revolutionary healthcare for women where cutting-edge research and innovation is desperately needed. The Company's technology platform is based on physics and geometry to deliver targeted drug therapy to the uterus. The first product, (3D-001), is a frameless, magnetic, nonhormonal intrauterine device (IUD) for long-acting contraception that conforms to a woman's body and is combined with our unique, patented Slider\u2122 system (inserter/ retriever) designed to eliminate steps and pain points as well as the nuisance factor of strings (needed for removal). 3Daughters' vision is to solve health issues for women, particularly significant (neglected) problems, like outdated painful IUDs. 3Daughters plans to radically disrupt the IUD market by addressing the major adoption barrier - insertion (and retrieval) pain. This pain is associated with all current rigid, plastic T-shaped framed IUDs on the market and prevents women from selecting one of the most effective forms of birth control.\n\nVisit 3daughtershealth.com for more information.\n\nPR Contact:\n\nEric Bloom\n\nebloom@mercuryllc.com\n\nIR Contact:\n\nSharon Choe\n\nschoe@3daughtershealth.com",

            "content": "Emblaveo, a new combination antibiotic developed in a partnership between AbbVie and Pfizer, received FDA approval to address difficult-to-treat intra-abdominal bacterial infections, AbbVie announced on Friday.\n\nEmbalveo\u2019s development partnership was originally between Pfizer and Allergan Inc., the latter of which was acquired by AbbVie in June 2019 for a whopping $63 billion. Under the terms of the partnership, AbbVie holds Emblaveo\u2019s rights in the U.S. and Canada, while Pfizer has the rights for the drug in the rest of the world.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a leading global public health threat, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with nearly 5 million associated deaths per year\u2014and that number is set to double by 2050 if more treatment options are not able to address the problem. Despite this, investment in the development of new antimicrobials has been falling, with some smaller antibiotic-focused companies filing for bankruptcy while many larger companies have exited the space due to issues in achieving profitability with these treatments.\n\nThis is a \u201cclassic example of a market failure, with little to no incentive to invest in AMR versus other promising therapeutics,\u201d John Stanford, executive director of Incubate, a coalition of life science venture capital firms, previously told BioSpace .\n\nEmblaveo is a combination of aztreonam, a traditional \u03b2-lactam similar to penicillin, and avibactam, an inhibitor of bacterial anti-microbial resistance proteins. It\u2019s approved for use in combination with another antibiotic and antiprotozoal called metronidazole. Emblaveo is indicated for patients who have limited or no other options, with multi-drug resistant intra-abdominal infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter.\n\n\u201cThe approval of EMBLAVEO provides physicians a much-needed therapeutic option to help address some of the most difficult antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and provides doctors an opportunity to treat patients with these challenging infections,\u201d infectious disease specialist James A. McKinnell said in a statement from AbbVie.\n\nAbbVie is expecting Emblaveo to hit the U.S. market sometime in the third quarter of 2025. The European Commission approved Emblaveo in April 2024.\n\nIn data from the Phase III REVISIT trial, run by Pfizer and announced in October 2024 , Emblaveo achieved a cure rate of 76.4%, beating the 74.0% cure rate of meropenem, a current standard antibiotic treatment intra-abdominal Gram-negative infections.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new combination antibiotic developed by AbbVie and Pfizer for tough-to-treat bacterial infections.\n\nThe drug, named Emblaveo, is cleared for use alongside the antibiotic metronidazole in adults who have either limited or no other available options to treat their complicated intra-abdominal infections. The drug is indicated for use even if those infections are caused by so-called gram-negative bacteria, like E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\nGram-negative bacterial infections are difficult to control and seen as a public health threat because of their ability to thwart available treatment. The World Health Organization notes antimicrobial resistance is making infections harder to treat and medical procedures riskier. One estimate holds that antibiotic resistance could lead to more than 39 million deaths globally by 2050.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe FDA has long prioritized and incentivized research into new antibiotics. And though drugmakers still struggle to sell them due to well-established financial challenges, there have been a series of drug approvals in recent years.\n\nEmblaveo has two components. One is the antibiotic aztreonam and the other is avibactam, which helps aztreonam fight bacteria that can resist treatment. Its approval was supported by data from a Phase 3 study testing the combination against the antibiotic meropenem in complicated intra-abdominal infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Study results published in The Lancet in February showed Emblaveo led to similar cure rates. Mortality rates were also similar between study groups.\n\nAccording to AbbVie, Emblaveo is the first combination therapy of its kind approved for use against these types of tough-to-treat infections. The drug was cleared last year in Europe for people with multidrug-resistant infections and limited treatment options.\n\nAbbvie holds drug rights in the U.S. and Canada, while Pfizer owns commercialization rights elsewhere.\n\nThe drug is expected to be available in the U.S. by the third quarter.",

            "content": "February is the shortest month, but that doesn't mean income investors don't have much time to find great stocks. Three Motley Fool contributors believe they have identified fabulous dividend stocks to buy this month. Here's why they like AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD).\n\nResurging dividend royalty\n\nKeith Speights (AbbVie): AbbVie has been a longtime favorite for income investors. The big drugmaker's 52 consecutive years of dividend increases (including when it was part of Abbott) qualify it as a Dividend King. Its forward dividend yield is a juicy 3.4%.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nFor a while, though, AbbVie might not have been viewed as a fabulous pick by many investors. Humira, the company's top-selling drug for years, lost U.S. patent exclusivity in early 2023. As a result, revenue and profits began to sink.\n\nHowever, it's a much different story today. Business is booming for Humira's two successors, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The two drugs generated combined sales in 2024 that eclipsed Humira's peak annual sales. AbbVie projects they'll generate sales of over $31 billion in 2027.\n\nThe drugmaker has other important growth drivers, too. Qulipta and Ubrelvy especially stand out, with sales for the two migraine therapies skyrocketing 76% and 30% year over year, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAbbVie's pipeline also looks promising. The company has over 50 programs in mid- or late-stage clinical development. Tavapadon is one candidate to watch in the near term. It recently reported positive late-stage results for the drug in treating early Parkinson's disease.\n\nLook past the recent clinical setback\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Amgen): What to do when a biotech's shares fall off a cliff following disappointing phase 2 clinical trial results? If the drugmaker's prospects are largely unaffected, it's a good opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nThat brings us to Amgen. In November, it reported mid-stage clinical trial results for MariTide, an investigational weight loss treatment, and the market responded by sending the stock down more than 12%.\n\nThough Amgen has recouped much of that loss, the stock is still down over the trailing-12-month period. Long-term income seekers should take the opportunity to buy its shares since its prospects and dividend program remain robust.\n\nThe company's lineup features 13 products that generate over $1 billion in sales. Many of them are still growth drivers, including Repatha, to treat high cholesterol; postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment Evenity; and Tepezza, for thyroid eye disease.\n\nAmgen has several other drugs that don't bring in $1 billion in annual sales yet but should soon, especially Tezspire, which treats asthma.\n\nThe drugmaker's pipeline is still pretty deep and features several dozen programs. Despite MariTide not quite living up to expectations in mid-stage clinical trials, it could still go on to become successful in the weight loss and obesity markets.\n\nLastly, Amgen has increased its payouts by 201% in the past decade and offers a forward yield of 3.3%, compared to the S&P 500's average of about 1.3%. It may have lagged the market over the past year, but the stock is still an excellent option for dividend seekers.\n\nGilead is a steady dividend stock with a high, growing payout\n\nDavid Jagielski (Gilead Sciences): Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences can make for a terrific dividend stock to buy and hold right now. It yields 3.2%, which is more than twice the S&P 500 average.\n\nThe company has also been growing its dividend. In five years, Gilead's quarterly payout has risen from $0.63 to $0.77 per share -- that's an increase of 22%. For investors, it can be crucial to find a company that is likely to increase its payouts because that can help offset the effects of inflation.\n\nGilead's business also generates plenty of free cash flow, which not only can support the current dividend but also pave the way for more increases to the payout in the future. In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated free cash flow totaling $9.4 billion -- far more than the $3.9 billion in dividends it paid out during that time frame.\n\nAnother reason dividend investors will love Gilead is for the stability the stock offers. It has a low beta value of around 0.20, which means that the stock generally doesn't move along with the market. But despite this, it has still made for an excellent investment, rising by more than 50% in the past five years.\n\nGilead has a robust business that centers around HIV drugs. But the company has also been pursuing growth opportunities in treating liver disease and cancer, which make this a much more diversified investment overall. It may not be a fast-growing pharma stock, but with solid fundamentals and a great dividend, it can be an ideal investment for income seekers to load up on today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "What's better than a good thing? More of a good thing.\n\nIncome investors can find plenty of \"good things\" in the market these days. There are many stocks with exceptional dividends to check out. And some are especially worthy of investors' attention.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nHere are three dividend stocks to double up on right now.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) topped Wall Street's revenue and adjusted earnings estimates with its 2024 fourth-quarter results. The big drugmaker also announced full-year 2025 guidance that was better than expected.\n\nAny concerns about the loss of U.S. exclusivity for AbbVie's former top-selling drug Humira should be fully alleviated by now. Humira's two successors, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, combined to generate sales of $5.6 billion in Q4. AbbVie expects the drugs to rake in nearly $24 billion in 2025. That's more than Humira generated at its peak.\n\nEven better, AbbVie now projects that Skyrizi and Rinvoq will make more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027. That's $4 billion higher than the company's guidance from last year. Why such a big jump in forecasted sales? The drugs are overperforming in inflammatory bowel disease indications.\n\nAbbVie's forward dividend yield remains attractive at 3.43%. The company is a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of dividend increases. I think that streak will continue with AbbVie's growing free cash flow.\n\n2. Enbridge\n\nSome might have worried that President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports to the U.S. could hurt Enbridge(NYSE: ENB). Nope. Even if the president hadn't paused the tariffs for 30 days, Enbridge would have been in good shape.\n\nFor one thing, Enbridge wouldn't have been impacted by the proposed 10% tariff on Canadian energy products. The prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that flow through the company's pipelines don't impact its revenue.\n\nMuch of Enbridge's business is centered in the U.S. rather than Canada, anyway. That's especially the case now that the company is North America's largest natural gas utility, with major operations in North Carolina, Ohio, and Utah.\n\nI view Enbridge as one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Its forward dividend yield tops 6%. The company has increased its dividend for an impressive 30 consecutive years. Enbridge's growth prospects look great, too, with data centers driving electric power demand and the conversion of coal power plants to natural gas.\n\n3. Pfizer\n\nSome investors could be worried about Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. potentially heading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Not me. I think Pfizer will be fine regardless of who's at the helm of HHS.\n\nPfizer recently announced better-than-expected Q4 results. Products picked up with the acquisition of Seagen were big contributors to growth, including Adcetris and Padcev. So were other acquired drugs, especially Nurtec ODT. Pfizer's cost-cutting efforts also paid off, with adjusted diluted earnings per share soaring more than 6x.\n\nSure, Pfizer still faces patent expirations for several key products over the next few years. However, the company fully expects to deliver solid growth in the second half of this decade despite this patent cliff. Pfizer thinks its current growth drivers and pipeline programs will more than offset the sales declines for products that will lose exclusivity.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer's dividend looks as attractive as ever. The forward dividend yield stands at 6.5%. CFO David Denton again confirmed in the Q4 earnings call that Pfizer remains committed to \"maintaining and growing\" the dividend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "North Chicago: AbbVie has announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EMBLAVEO (aztreonam and avibactam), as a fixed-dose, intravenous, monobactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic. It is approved in combination with metronidazole, for patients 18 years and older who have limited or no alternative options for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), including those caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Serratia marcescens.\n\nApproval of this indication is based on limited clinical safety and efficacy data for EMBLAVEO. Gram-negative bacterial infections are among the most challenging for healthcare professionals to control due to high antimicrobial resistance (AMR). When AMR develops, medicines intended to treat these infections become ineffective, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n\"The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacteria has left some patients with little to no treatment options, resulting in extended hospital stays, additional morbidity and death,\" said James A. McKinnell, M.D., infectious disease specialist, Milefchik-Rand Medical Group, Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California. \"The approval of EMBLAVEO provides physicians a much-needed therapeutic option to help address some of the most difficult antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and provides doctors an opportunity to treat patients with these challenging infections.\"\n\nAMR is considered an urgent global public health threat and could lead to over 39 million deaths worldwide by 2050. An estimated 1.14 million deaths globally were attributed to bacterial AMR in 2021 alone. If AMR remains unaddressed, minor infections and routine surgical procedures could become life-threatening or fatal. The FDA has prioritized the research and development of new medicines to treat AMR and help prevent the spread of infection.\n\n\"As bacteria evolve, industry, government, and clinical experts must work together to ensure that the infectious disease community has the tools to advance public health,\" said Roopal Thakkar, M.D., executive vice president, research & development, chief scientific officer, AbbVie. \"We're proud to offer this important novel treatment option to urgently address the significant threat of antimicrobial resistance.\"\n\nEMBLAVEO is a medication that combines two components: aztreonam, a monobactam antibiotic, and avibactam, a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor that protects aztreonam from serine \u03b2-lactamase hydrolysis and restores its activity against bacteria that co-produce Metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs) and serine \u03b2-lactamases. MBLs are a type of enzyme produced by certain bacteria that can become resistant to antibiotics and are on the rise globally. The approval of EMBLAVEO was supported by prior findings regarding the efficacy and safety of aztreonam for the treatment of cIAI. It was also supported by clinical trial results from the Phase 3 REVISIT study, which evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of EMBLAVEO for the treatment of serious infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, including MBL-producing multidrug-resistant pathogens, for which there are limited or no treatment options.\n\nIn 2019, the FDA granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) Designation and Fast Track Designation for EMBLAVEO. The QIDP Designation provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and eligibility for the FDA's Fast Track Designation, and a five-year regulatory exclusivity extension. The Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development of and accelerate the review of drugs to treat serious conditions that do not have sufficient treatment options.\n\nEMBLAVEO will be available for commercial use in the U.S. in Q3 2025.",

It is approved in combination with metronidazole, for patients 18 years and older who have limited or no alternative options for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, including those caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Serratia marcescens. Approval of this indication is based on limited clinical safety and efficacy data for EMBLAVEO. Gram-negative bacterial infections are among the most challenging for healthcare professionals to control due to high antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the FDA granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product Designation and Fast Track Designation for EMBLAVEO. The QIDP Designation provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and eligibility for the FDA\u2019s Fast Track Designation, and a five-year regulatory exclusivity extension.8 The Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development of and accelerate the review of drugs to treat serious conditions that do not have sufficient treatment options. EMBLAVEO will be available for commercial use in the U.S. in Q3 2025.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.",

            "content": "AbbVie (ABBV) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which AbbVie belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, AbbVie is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of +10% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.25 points to a change of +21.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.93 indicates a change of +13.7% from what AbbVie is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, AbbVie is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor AbbVie, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.46 billion and $63.98 billion estimates indicate +5.5% and +7.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAbbVie reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.56%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAbbVie is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about AbbVie. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

The longer people have them, the greater the chances are that they will develop complications, some of which will require more surgery.\n\nBreast implants have been associated with the development of a cancer of the immune system called breast implant\u2013associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). This cancer occurs more commonly in patients with textured breast implants than smooth implants, although rates are not well defined. Some patients have died from BIA-ALCL.\n\nPatients receiving breast implants have reported a variety of systemic symptoms, such as joint pain, muscle aches, confusion, chronic fatigue, autoimmune diseases, and others. Individual patient risk for developing these symptoms has not been well established. Some patients report complete resolution of symptoms when the implants are removed without replacement.\n\nWho can get breast implants?\n\nNatrelle\u00ae Breast Implants are approved for the following:\n\nBreast augmentation for women at least 22 years old for silicone-filled implants and for women at least 18 years old for saline-filled implants. Breast augmentation includes primary breast augmentation to increase the breast size and revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast augmentation\n\nBreast augmentation includes primary breast augmentation to increase the breast size and revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast augmentation Breast reconstruction. This includes primary breast reconstruction to replace breast tissue that has been removed due to cancer or trauma or that has failed to develop properly due to a severe breast abnormality. This also includes revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast reconstruction\n\nWho should NOT get breast implants?\n\nBreast implant surgery should NOT be performed in:\n\nWomen with active infection anywhere in their body\n\nWomen with existing cancer or precancer of their breast who have not received adequate treatment for those conditions\n\nWomen who are currently pregnant or nursing\n\nWhat should I tell my doctor?\n\nTell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions, as the risks of breast implant surgery may be higher:\n\nAutoimmune diseases (eg, lupus and scleroderma)\n\nA weakened immune system (eg, taking medications to decrease the body's immune response)\n\nPlanned chemotherapy or radiation therapy following breast implant placement\n\nConditions or medications that interfere with wound healing and blood clotting\n\nReduced blood supply to breast tissue\n\nClinical diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorders, including body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders\n\nThose with a diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorders should wait for resolution or stabilization of these conditions prior to undergoing breast implantation surgery\n\nWhat else should I consider?\n\nThere is a Boxed Warning for breast implants. Please see bold text at beginning\n\nMany changes to your breasts following implantation are irreversible. If you later choose to have your implants removed and not replaced, you may experience dimpling, puckering, wrinkling, or other cosmetic changes, which may be permanent\n\nBreast implantation is likely not a one-time surgery. The longer implants are in place, the greater the potential risk for complications. You will likely need additional surgeries on your breasts due to complications or unacceptable cosmetic results. Thus, you should also consider the complication rates for later (revision) surgery since you may experience these risks in the future\n\nCancer treatments and surgery will affect the outcome and timing of breast reconstruction\n\nBreast implants may affect your ability to breastfeed, either by reducing or eliminating milk production\n\nRupture of a silicone-filled breast implant is most often silent. Even if you have no symptoms, you should have your first ultrasound or MRI at 5 to 6 years after your initial implant surgery and then every 2 to 3 years thereafter regardless of whether your implants are for augmentation or reconstruction. If you have symptoms of or uncertain ultrasound results for breast implant rupture, an MRI is recommended. Additional imaging may be required depending on your medical history and status. The health consequences of a ruptured silicone gel-filled breast implant have not been fully established\n\nRoutine screening mammography for breast cancer will be more difficult, and implants may rupture during the procedure. Perform self-examination every month for cancer screening and ask your surgeon to help you distinguish the implant from your breast tissue. Lumps, persistent pain, swelling, hardening, or changes in implant shape should be reported to your surgeon and possibly evaluated with imaging\n\nWhat are key complications with breast implants?\n\nKey complications include reoperation, implant removal with or without replacement, implant rupture with silicone-filled implants, implant deflation with saline-filled implants, and capsular contracture (severe scar tissue around the implant). Other complications include breast pain, swelling, asymmetry, wrinkling/rippling, implant malposition nipple complications, hypertrophic scarring, and implant palpability/visibility.\n\nTalk to your doctor about other complications.\n\nFor more information, see the patient brochures at www.allergan.com/products .\n\nTo report a problem with Natrelle\u00ae Breast Implants, please call Allergan\u00ae at 1-800-624-4261.\n\nThe sale and distribution of Natrelle\u00ae Breast Implants is restricted to licensed physicians who provide information to patients about the risks and benefits of breast implant surgery.\n\nAbout Allergan Aesthetics\n\nAt Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, we develop, manufacture, and market a portfolio of leading aesthetics brands and products.

(NYSE:ABBV) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$29b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 14% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about AbbVie.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for AbbVie\n\nNYSE:ABBV Ownership Breakdown February 6th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About AbbVie?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAbbVie already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of AbbVie, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Earnings and Revenue Growth February 6th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in AbbVie. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 4.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries as a major investing theme in 2025. The technology's ability to automate complex workflows and enhance productivity is seen as a game-changer for the next generation of innovation.\n\nPerhaps the most promising AI application is its potential to revolutionize medicine by accelerating the drug discovery process to deliver more effective therapies. Several biotechnology companies are embracing these cutting-edge capabilities to unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere are three fantastic biotech stocks harnessing the power of AI that could make a great addition to your portfolio.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) is a leader in biopharmaceuticals with a product portfolio spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including a strong focus on immunology diseases and an expanding oncology and neuroscience franchise.\n\nThe stock rallied sharply following a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report, propelled by strong sales of blockbuster autoimmune drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq -- seen as improved successors to the legacy Humira. Management expects continued operating and financial momentum, targeting 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $12.12 and $12.32, representing a solid 21% increase at the midpoint over the 2024 result.\n\nOptimism surrounds AbbVie's artificial intelligence strategy, which is centered on AbbVie Research and Development Convergence Hub (ARCH) and is coupled with an extensive drug candidate pipeline. This platform enables scientists to mine large-scale data, advance AI drug discovery, and optimize drug design. By integrating AI and machine learning into the R&D process, the company aims to potentially cut the traditional 10- to 15-year timeline for developing new medicines in half.\n\nUltimately, AbbVie appears to have all the pieces in place to reward shareholders over the long run.\n\n2. Gilead Sciences\n\nA winning approach to investing can sometimes be as simple as sticking with a proven winner. That's great news for shareholders of Gilead Sciences(NASDAQ: GILD), as the stock is up 26% over the past year, reaching its highest level in nearly a decade.\n\nThis biotech giant is recognized for its antiviral therapies, leading global markets for HIV and hepatitis C treatments while making impressive progress diversifying into areas like oncology. The company's third-quarter 2024 earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates amid strong demand across its product portfolio. Management projected confidence by hiking its full-year revenue and EPS target, citing positive market traction for Livdelzi, which treats primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a debilitating liver disease.\n\nGilead's outlook into 2025 is promising, with multiple late-stage clinical programs pending data readouts. In January, the company expanded its partnership with Cognizant to develop custom generative AI solutions aimed at enhancing corporate efficiency. A separate collaboration with privately held Terray Therapeutics leverages the biotech firm's AI-driven \"tNova drug discovery platform,\" with Gilead securing an exclusive option to commercialize potential products developed through the program.\n\nThese initiatives position Gilead to maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving biotechnology landscape. The company's ability to continue innovating makes Gilead a compelling stock to own in what could be a milestone year.\n\n3. Moderna\n\nIn contrast to shares of AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, which have been strong performers to kick off 2025, Moderna(NASDAQ: MRNA) stands out as a turnaround opportunity.\n\nThe company, recognized for its pioneering role in mRNA vaccine development, has struggled to manage declining demand for COVID-19 immunizations. Market concerns regarding Moderna's ability to produce a new blockbuster drug have led to its stock dropping by a disastrous 64% over the past year. Nevertheless, this volatility can present investors with a compelling buying opportunity in a beaten-down industry leader, which could be the case here.\n\nModerna is moving forward with exciting therapeutic prospects, including new vaccines for norovirus and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In January, the company received a $590 million award from the U.S. government to complete late-stage development of an H5N1 avian influenza vaccine.\n\nThe company has set an ambitious goal of securing 10 new product approvals within three years, with artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role. Moderna is building a comprehensive digital platform and cloud-native infrastructure, collaborating with tech leaders like OpenAI and IBM to integrate AI across its value chain and scale mRNA technology.\n\nInvestors confident in Moderna's ability to get back on track with stronger growth may view the current stock price as an attractive entry point for a long-term holding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The promise of precision medicine relies on the deep understanding of patient genomes and associated vulnerabilities. The CRISPR revolution and genomic profiling technologies, spearheaded by large consortium efforts such as the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap)8 and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia9,10 have enabled several novel discoveries over the past decade. The integration of these large profiling datasets provides an auspicious opportunity to identify additional synthetic lethal targets among diverse genetic contexts. Synthetic lethality, in which the concurrent loss of two individually non-essential genes results in a loss of cell viability, exemplifies this precision medicine approach in cancer therapy and has shaped much of the clinical landscape of tumour-intrinsic cancer therapies in the twenty-first century.\n\nTo explore novel synthetic lethal targets, we developed a digenic CRISPR library of putative synthetic lethal partners11. Previously, in vitro screening confirmed several well-established paralogue synthetic lethal interactions such as STAG1\u2013STAG212; we hypothesized that the context of an in vivo CRISPR screen could enable discovery of further therapeutic targets. Here, we began by carrying out an in vivo CRISPR screen in established cell line-derived MDA-MB-231 and NCI-H1299 xenografts (Fig. 1a). In general, we observed strong concordance between putative synthetic lethal pairs tested in MDA-MBA-231 and NCI-H1299 (Fig. 1b). However, IFN\u03921 and PELO sgRNAs were specifically depleted in MDA-MB-231 but not in NCI-H1299 xenograft models (Supplementary Table 1). Whereas NCI-H1299 expresses both PELO and IFN\u03921, MDA-MB-231 specifically lacks the IFN\u03921 transcript. The lack of IFN\u03921expression in MDA-MB-231 can be explained by the deletion of 9p21.3, which includes the common tumour suppressor gene CDKN2A13.\n\nFig. 1: PELO is a selective dependency in cancers with 9p21.3 loss. a, Design of in vivo CRISPR screen. s.c, subcutaneous. b, Digenic CRISPR dropout correlation.

Growth of size-matched (200 mm3) xenografted 9p21-deleted MIAPACA2 tumours with doxycycline (dox)-inducible sgRNA targeting PELO (sgPELO) or non-targeting sgRNA (NTC).

Source Data Full size image\n\nBecause of the unique, non-paralogue depletion of PELO and IFN\u03921 in the tumour model with 9p21.3 loss, we hypothesized that PELO alone drives the selective anti-proliferative phenotype observed in MDA-MB-231 and that PELO dependence may be dictated by collateral loss of a 9p21.3 gene other than IFN\u03921. Human PELO\u2014which is evolutionarily conserved through archaea and is most well studied as dom34 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u2014is the critical effector protein of the ribosomal rescue and mRNA surveillance complex14,15,16. PELO functions largely in ribosome recycling during no-go and non-stop mRNA decay translation quality control processes, wherein ribosomes accumulate at sites of blunt 3\u2032 mRNA cleavage17 or on poly A tails after skipping of a canonical stop codon due to error or absence18,19. The ribosome rescue complex is comprised of PELO, an associated GTPase, HBS1L and the ATPase ABCE1, which function in concert to split the 80S ribosome and replenish free ribosomal subunit pools for further productive translation20,21,22.\n\nIn support, we confirmed monogenic PELO dependency in MDA-MB-231, but not in NCI-H1299, using four independent guide RNAs (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c). Across DepMap23 models, PELO dependency exhibited a strongly selective profile regardless of lineage (Extended Data Fig. 1d). We found that low RNA expression of several genes located on the 9p21.3 locus (KLHL9, R = 0.25; FOCAD, R = 0.24; MTAP, R = 0.17; and DMRTA1, R = 0.16) strongly correlated with dependency on PELO (Fig. 1c). Two-group analysis of the large 9p21.3 deep deletion encompassing all genes located between a boundary established by DMRTA1 and MLLT3 confirmed a significant association with PELO dependency (n = 57, P = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22126; Fig. 1d).\n\nWe next investigated the effect of PELO knockout in a panel of cancer cell lines (n = 24) selected by large 9p21.3 deletion status. Overall, PELO loss showed consistent selectivity and robust loss of viability among cell models harbouring large 9p21.3 loss (n = 15; Fig. 1e and Extended Data Figs. 1e and 2a). Highlighting the specificity of PELO dependence for 9p21.3 status, knockout in four normal cell lines from different tissues did not result in viability changes (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To solidify this genetic relationship between 9p21.3 and PELO in vivo, we selected MIAPACA2, a pancreatic cancer cell line model with a naturally occurring 9p21.3 deletion to generate a polyclonal inducible-knockout system. Induction of PELO knockout in established MIAPACA2 xenografts resulted in significant tumour growth inhibition of 74% (P = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124; Fig. 1f). Although we observed robust tumour growth inhibition, we observed only a 60% partial reduction in PELO protein levels throughout the study (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g). The regression and return of tumour growth correlates with quantifiable return of PELO protein levels. These data identify and validate PELO as a bona fide vulnerability in tumours with 9p21.3 loss.\n\nTo identify the causal synthetic lethal interactor with PELO, we generated a clonal NCI-H1299 PELO\u2212/\u2212 model with no discernable growth rate differences compared with the parent (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We generated a single guide RNA (sgRNA) library (Supplementary Table 2) containing associated ribosomal and translational ontological pathways24,25, UniProt-predicted PELO-interacting proteins26, and all genes commonly deep deleted on 9p21.3 (Fig. 2a). Parental and PELO-knockout cells were propagated with library for two weeks and then sequenced for sgRNA representation (Fig. 2b). As DepMap suggested a genetic interaction between PELO and a gene located within the boundary of the 9p21.3 chromosome deletion, we first looked at representation across genes frequently deleted within the 9p21.3 loci. Of candidate 9p21.3 genes (n = 21), only sgRNAs targeting FOCAD were significantly and specifically depleted in the PELO-knockout background (P = 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22123; Extended Data Fig. 4a), identifying FOCAD deletion on 9p21.3 as the driver synthetic lethal partner dictating PELO dependency.\n\nFig. 2: FOCAD deletion dictates 9p21 synthetic lethality. a, PELO SL-ID library composition.

Full size image\n\nThe function of FOCAD remains largely unknown, but germline deletions and an increased incidence of FOCAD mutations in familial colorectal and breast cancers suggest that it may have a role as a putative tumour suppressor27,28. Although we expected to find a gene within the 9p21.3 boundary, we were surprised to also observe that both SKIV2L (also known as SKIC2) and TTC37 (SKIC3) exhibited a greater significance than FOCAD in the NCI-H1299 PELO\u2212/\u2212 cell line (Fig. 2c). Functional protein networks identified SKIV2L, TTC37 and a third hit, WDR61, as core components of the SKI complex (SKIc) (Fig. 2d), which is responsible for mRNA extraction from ribosomes permitting exonuclease activity and turnover of damaged mRNAs29,30. Of note, recent reports highlight germline pathogenic FOCAD mutations in paediatric liver cirrhosis and suggest that FOCAD functions as a critical scaffold protein to maintain the stability of the core SKIc members, SKIV2L and TTC3731. Together, these data present a strong genetic link between FOCAD, SKIc, and PELO in human cancers and illuminate the synthetic lethal interaction between two independent complexes.\n\nTo test the relationship between FOCAD and SKIc in cancer, we returned to DepMap and tested whether PELO dependency correlated to the loss of SKIc proteins across the proteome. In agreement with the PELO synthetic lethal ID (SL-ID) screen, low protein expression of SKIV2L and TTC37 (R = 0.46 and 0.45 respectively) were top predictors of PELO dependency, followed by low expression of the SKIc accessory proteins FOCAD (R = 0.28) and AVEN (R = 0.24, Fig. 3a). TTC37 and SKIV2L protein levels significantly correlate across both FOCAD (9p21.3)-deleted cell lines (n = 57; Fig. 3b,c) and tumours (n = 36; SKIV2L, P = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22126; TTC37, P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22127; Fig. 3d,e), supporting the role of FOCAD in promoting SKIV2L stability. In addition, SKIV2L and TTC37 expression at the protein level exhibit remarkable correlation in both cell lines (n = 375, r = 0.94) (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and tumours (n = 1022, R2 = 0.75) (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Table 3), indicating that SKIV2L and TTC37 may act as requisite post-transcriptional stability partners.\n\nFig. 3: SKIc is lost in cancer and drives PELO dependency. a, Pearson correlation between PELO Chronos CRISPR score and whole-proteome data from cell lines (n = 375) available in the 23Q4 DepMap release.

Representative data shown as n = 3 independent biological replicates (g,i) or representative data shown from one of two independent replicates (c,f,j). Source Data Full size image\n\nWe next generated a panel of clonal isogenic models in NCI-H1299 cells with knockout of SKIV2L, TTC37, FOCAD or AVEN and probed for the remaining SKIc proteins. In all SKIc isogenic models, we observed destabilization of the non-edited members compared with basal expression, with the exception of WDR61 (Fig. 3f). We suspect that the incorporation of WDR61 in the co-transcriptional PAF complex may protect it from destabilization upon collapse of SKIc32. Notably, the core enzymatic SKIc proteins SKIV2L and TTC37 were depleted across all SKIc knockouts, whereas FOCAD and AVEN were interdependent upon each other, suggesting that the incorporation of FOCAD and AVEN into the core SKIc is necessary for stability but alone is not sufficient for functional activity (Fig. 3f).\n\nAs SKIc destabilization was observed across all derived isogenic models, we next asked whether PELO would be synthetic lethal with deletion of any SKIc member. Consistently across orthogonal methods, loss of any SKIc member (SKIV2L, P = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125; TTC37, P = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22125; FOCAD, P = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124; AVEN, P = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22125; or WDR61) conferred selective anti-proliferative phenotypes in PELO-deficient, but not wild-type, NCI-H1299 cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4g,h); this was confirmed in a HAP1 SKIV2L\u2212/\u2212 isogenic pair (P = 9.9 \u00d7 10\u22127; Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). We also noted an upregulation in the basal machinery of the ribosomal rescue complex (PELO, HBS1L and ABCE1) in the SKI deficient isogenic models, hinting at increased reliance on PELO function (Extended Data Fig. 4c). In FOCAD (9p21.3)-deleted MIAPACA2 cells, SKIc rescue via exogenous SKIV2L, TTC37 or dual SKIV2L and TTC37 co-expression (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125, 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 or 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively) was insufficient to protect cells from PELO dependency, suggesting that the SKIc function requires more than just the core helicase for rescue complex activity. Solely upon re-expression of FOCAD did we observe full complex and functional rescue of PELO dependency (Fig. 3h,i). To confirm the results from FOCAD depletion experiments regarding the loss of associated SKIc members (Fig. 3f), we generated a MIAPACA2 model with FOCAD under the inducible control of a degron tag (dTAG)33. Treatment with 500 nM of dTAG-v1 depleted FOCAD protein levels within four hours. Following FOCAD degradation, levels of SKIV2L, TTC37 and AVEN protein decreased by 8 h, reaching a maximum by 2 days (Fig. 3j). Consistent with a mechanism through which loss of protein complex subunits leads to posttranslational quality control34, we observed no meaningful downregulation in SKIc RNA levels up to 24 h (FOCAD, P = 0.99; TTC37, P = 0.14; SKIV2L, P = 0.17; AVEN, P = 0.03; Extended Data Fig. 4f).\n\nAs our data support the notion that PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality can occur regardless of which SKIc member is lost, we rationalized that in addition to 9p21.3, other chromosomal deletions may present additional translational opportunity. Although the homozygous deletion of FOCAD (9p21.3) is the most frequently deleted SKIc member (4% PanCan), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database highlights mutually exclusive homozygous deletions of SKIV2L, TTC37, AVEN or WDR61 (also known as SKIC8) in another 2% of cancers (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Furthermore, SKIc members are found to be mutated across multiple tumour types (Extended Data Fig. 6f). All identified mutations are characterized as variants of unknown significance (Supplementary Table 4); however, several cancer-associated missense and nonsense SKIV2L (R483C, R756* and R510*) and TTC37 (R570* and R1503C) mutations are causal in patients with trihepatoenteric syndrome (THES)35,36,37. To validate whether overlapping cancer and THES missense mutations may also drive a synthetic lethal interaction with PELO, we attempted to rescue PELO dependency by exogenous expression of either SKIV2L wild type or R483C in the NCI-H1299 SKIV2L\u2212/\u2212 model. Unexpectedly, and mechanistically divergent from SKIV2L knockout, stable expression of both forms of SKIV2L increased TTC37 protein levels. However, consistent with the characterized pathogenicity of R483C in THES, stable expression of this mutant phenocopied SKIV2L knockout, suggesting R483 is critical for enzymatic function but not stability of SKIV2L (Extended Data Fig. 5c\u2013e). Together, these data support a hypothesis in which nonfunctional SKIc can be attained via multiple genomic alterations, converging on a synthetic lethal relationship with PELO.\n\nOutside of FOCAD (9p21.3) and SKIc loss, PELO dependency best correlated to low protein expression of MLH1 and PMS1, two frequently mutated genes that permit a hypermutated phenotype characteristic of high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) (Fig. 3a). MSI-H tumours account for 3.8% of all cancers and up to 15% of colorectal, uterine and ovarian tumours38, and MSI-H status is mutually exclusive with FOCAD (9p21.3) deep deletion in major microsatellite instability lineages (bowel, uterine, ovarian and lymphoid), suggesting that MSI-H and FOCAD deletion may converge on a common biomarker (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Proteomics across MSI-H cancer cell lines previously identified low expression of both SKIV2L and TTC37 as compared to MSS models39, indicating that our observed correlation between PELO dependence and the MSI-H cell state may also hinge on SKIc stability.\n\nConsistent with this hypothesis, we validated a specific dependency for PELO in the MSI-H cell lines HCT-116, RKO, DLD-1 and MFE-319 (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and DepMap showed higher PELO dependence in MSI-H compared with microsatellite stable (MSS) cell model (n = 61; bowel, P = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221213; uterine, P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22123; ovary, P = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22123; and lymphoid, P = 0.03; Extended Data Fig. 6b). We next explored whether the loss of SKIV2L and TTC37 in MSI-H cells mimicked the degree of SKIc loss seen in FOCAD (9p21.3) homozygous-deleted models. As expected, both MSI-H cell models (n = 6) and primary tumours (colorectal, n = 20; and uterine, n = 27) exhibited lower abundance of SKIV2L and TTC37 than MSS, phenocopying FOCAD (9p21.3)-deleted models but presenting independent of FOCAD protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013e). Unlike the MSI-H synthetic lethal target WRN40, PELO dependency does not appear to be dictated by TP53 status (Extended Data Fig. 6g), as highlighted by the DLD-1 TP53 wild type, MSI-H colorectal cancer model (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). Together, these data identify MSI-H tumours as a second biomarker-driven population with destabilized SKIc and dependence on PELO gene function. Loss of the SKIc, either through FOCAD (9p21.3) deletion, deletion of other SKIc members, mutation or MSI-H status converge on a common proteomic biomarker that is sufficient to drive a synthetic lethal dependency on PELO and strengthens the potential translational impact.\n\nWe next sought to determine the cellular mechanisms by which PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality resulted in the observed anti-proliferative phenotype. To address this, we carried out orthogonal high-content and flow cytometric panels in two sets of isogenic cell lines, NCI-H1299 with or without SKIV2L expression and MDA-MB-231 with or without FOCAD expression for three days after PELO knockout. We observed a marked loss of EdU incorporation, indicating a collapsed S-phase specifically in conditions in which both PELO and SKIc were lost (NCI-H1299 SKIV2L\u2212/\u2212, P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221213; and MDA-MB-231 FOCAD deletion, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211; Fig. 4a,b). The collapse of S-phase was confirmed by propidium iodide and EdU staining measured by flow cytometry in the same model set (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Cell cycle arrest differed between the NCI-H1299 and MDA-MB-231 isogenic models, with pauses in G1 and G2 respectively, suggesting there may be cell-specific factors that dictate the PELO and SKIc synthetic lethal phenotype (Fig. 4c). Further staining for cell viability markers did not quantifiably identify an early apoptotic response, consistent with a primary cell arrest phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 7c). By 120 h, both NCI-H1299 SKIV2L\u2212/\u2212 and MIAPACA2 show nearly a quarter of cells undergoing late apoptosis as measured by annexin V positivity (Extended Data Fig. 7d). These data support a model in which PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality initially forgoes normal S-phase progression, eventually leading towards late apoptosis and cell death.\n\nFig. 4: PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality induces cell cycle arrest and UPR. a, Representative high-content images of Hoechst and Edu staining in isogenic SKIc models 72 h after transfection of sgRNA targeting B2M (sgB2M), PELO (sgPELO) or RAN (sgRAN).

Source Data Full size image\n\nWe next utilized the SKIc-compromised MIAPACA2 model to assess global transcriptional changes after induction of PELO knockout. Analysis of differentially regulated pathways demonstrates consistent and significant upregulation of gene expression programmes driven by NF-\u03baB, p53 and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Several reports have highlighted an intricate relationship between the role of PELO and SKIc in no-go mRNA decay and the activity of the UPR pathway41,42. PELO loss in the MIAPACA2 model induced key UPR genes at the protein level at 48 h, before cell cycle and proliferation defects, and triggered downstream activation of p38 and JNK pathways. Concomitant with CHOP upregulation, we also observed an increase in cleaved PARP and p21 (Fig. 4e). To validate the MIAPACA2 transcriptomic and proteomic validation, we returned to our NCI-H1299 isogenic system and endogenous FOCAD (9p21.3)-deleted cell lines to assess changes in UPR pathway genes and the phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) pathway. By inducing PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality we observed a consistent and robust increase in IRE1\u03b1, CHOP and pJNK protein levels across several models (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7f), strongly suggesting that the induction of UPR is a consequence of dual loss of PELO and SKIc.\n\nAs IRE1\u03b1 activity is driven by dimerization43, we tested whether increased IRE1\u03b1 protein levels were sufficient to drive mechanistic activation upon induction of synthetic lethality. We observed a tenfold induction (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22126) of stained foci in the PELO-deleted cells compared with the negative control (Fig. 4g,h). IRE1\u03b1 was also upregulated in a panel of twelve 9p21.3-homozygous-deleted (n = 5) or wild-type (n = 7) models (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Together, the robust PELO and SKIc synthetic lethality phenotype appears to activate a UPR signalling cascade through IRE1\u03b1 and is associated with dysfunctional normal cell cycle progression through S-phase.\n\nStructural insights from yeast suggest that PELO and its requisite binding partner HBS1L work in concert with ABCE1 to comprise the functional rescue complex44. We thus postulated that HBS1L may phenocopy the synthetic lethality of PELO in SKIc-deficient tumour models. Although HBS1L dependency in DepMap appears less severe across most models as compared to PELO, dependency on the two proteins significantly correlates across the dataset, and HBS1L dependency correlates with the expression of 9p21.3 genes and protein levels of SKIc (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013c). HBS1L knockout across a panel comprising 11 SKIc wild-type (n = 6) or compromised cell lines (n = 5) elicited selective HBS1L dependency in the context of SKIc loss (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8d\u2013f). Our data suggest that HBS1L is a second vulnerability in SKIc-deficient models, and that it probably acts through regulation of the ribosome rescue complex.\n\nFig. 5: HBS1L is a synthetic lethal target in cancers with SKIc loss. a, HBS1L knockout in a panel of cell lines.

Two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test (a,d,g). Source Data Full size image\n\nThe structure of the mammalian PELO\u2013HBS1L interface45 was used to map putative regions of HBS1L that are responsible for the synthetic lethal relationship with the SKIc (Fig. 5b). We generated a HBS1L\u2212/\u2212 model in NC-H1299 cells and exogenously expressed several HBS1L-mutant constructs (Fig. 5c). Consistent with previous reports46,47, loss of HBS1L protein significantly destabilized PELO protein expression (Fig. 5c). We observed a lack of PELO protein and functional rescue in GTPase-dead (T325A, P = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22124; or H348A, P = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22125) and C-terminal-deleted HBS1L (\u0394568\u2013682, P = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125) constructs. Rescue occurred only with wild-type and N-terminus deleted (\u03941\u2013140) HBS1L constructs (P = 0.21 and 0.13, respectively), consistent with a hypothesis in which HBS1L phenocopies PELO\u2013SKIc synthetic lethality by maintaining PELO protein stability (Fig. 5c,d). To confirm the requirement of the C terminus of HBS1L for PELO, we used a HiBIT-tagged HBS1L to immunoprecipitate HBS1L and test for interaction with PELO. Full-length, wild-type HBS1L maintained the interaction with PELO, whereas the C-terminal truncated mutant HBS1L(\u0394568\u2013682) ablated binding with PELO, demonstrating the critical nature of the interaction surface for HBS1L and PELO complexing and function (Fig. 5e). Together, these results highlight the requirement for both GTPase activity and the PELO-interacting surface of HBS1L for functional ribosome rescue complex activity.\n\nFinally, we explored the functional response to HBS1L knockout in an inducible MIAPACA2 cell line model. Consistent with our previous observations, we observed PELO protein loss and pJNK activation at 48 h after HBS1L knockout (Fig. 5f). Induction of HBS1L knockout in established MIAPACA2 xenografts resulted in concomitant loss of HBS1L and PELO upon doxycycline treatment and 70% tumour growth inhibition (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22124), phenocopying the total growth inhibition of the MIAPACA2 inducible PELO-knockout xenografts (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). These data demonstrate that PELO destabilization through HBS1L depletion likely functionally drives the observed anti-proliferative phenotype, and that incomplete PELO inhibition is sufficient to confer a synthetic lethal relationship with SKIc.",

            "content": "AbbVie ABBV announced strong fourth-quarter 2024 results last week, beating estimates for both earnings and sales. While earnings of $2.16 per share declined around 22% year over year, sales rose 6.1% on an operational basis, mainly driven by robust sales of its immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. While sales of Skyrizi rose 57.9% on an operational basis, Rinvoq sales were up 47.1%. AbbVie\u2019s other key drugs, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs Ubrelvy, Elahere and Qulipta, also pushed top-line growth.\n\nAbbVie issued an impressive outlook for 2025. It expects adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.12-$12.32. Total revenues are expected to be approximately $59 billion, reflecting operational growth of 5.7% despite a roughly 4% negative impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign and rapid biosimilar erosion of blockbuster drug Humira\u2019s sales.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s stock has risen 8.1% since it released fourth-quarter results.\n\nLong-term investors, however, are not focused on a single quarter\u2019s results and their focus is rather on the company\u2019s strong fundamentals.\n\nABBV\u2019s Successful New Drugs \u2014 Skyrizi and Rinvoq\n\nAbbVie lost patent protection for Humira in the United States in January 2023 and in the EU in 2018. Humira's sales are declining due to the loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well. Skyrizi and Rinvoq generated combined sales of $17.7 billion in 2024. The drugs are seeing strong performance across all their approved indications, especially in the popular inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) space, which includes two conditions \u2014 ulcerative colitis (\u201cUC\u201d) and Crohn\u2019s disease (\u201dCD\u201d). Importantly, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have demonstrated compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies in clinical studies, which have given them a competitive advantage.\n\nOn the fourth-quarter call, AbbVie raised its 2027 forecast for combined Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales. It now expects to record combined revenues of more than $31 billion, up from the previously issued number of $27 billion.\n\nStrong immunology market growth, market share gains and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years, are expected to drive these drugs\u2019 future growth.\n\nABBV Boasts an Attractive Pipeline\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates that have blockbuster potential. The company expects several regulatory submissions and approvals and key data readouts in the next 12 months.\n\nAbbVie also has an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies in blood cancers and solid tumors like ABBV-383, a BCMA CD3 bispecific (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) and Temab-A (metastatic colorectal cancer). Teliso-V, a promising c-Met ADC is under review in the United States for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, with an approval decision expected in first half of 2025.\n\nIn November, AbbVie gained approval for Vyalev, a transformative therapy for treating advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. Studies are also ongoing to evaluate new indications for Botox and Juvederm collection of fillers.\n\nAbbVie on an Acquisition Spree\n\nAbbVie has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline. It has signed several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also signing some early-stage deals in oncology and neuroscience areas. It has signed more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience.\n\nABBV\u2019s Slowing Aesthetics Sales & Humira Erosion\n\nSales of AbbVie\u2019s blockbuster drug Humira are declining due to biosimilar erosion. Humira volume is rapidly eroding compared to other novel mechanisms (including Skyrizi and Rinvoq) with the decline expected to be sharper in 2025 as more plans exclude branded Humira and move to exclusive biosimilar contracts.\n\nAbbVie is seeing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China due to challenging market conditions. The slowing growth of the U.S. facial injectables market and persistent economic headwinds, which are impacting consumer spending in China, are hurting Juvederm's sales due to its higher price point. Juvederm sales declined 14.6% in 2024.\n\nIn fact, AbbVie\u2019s global sales of aesthetics portfolio declined 0.6% in 2024. On the fourth-quarter conference call, AbbVie also lowered its aesthetics franchise\u2019s long-term growth guidance.It expects a high single-digit CAGR for this franchise through 2029. This guidance translates to a little more than $7 billion, much lower than the previous expectation of more than $9 billion in 2030.\n\nABBV Stock Price, Valuation and Estimate Revision\n\nAbbVie stock has gained 9.6% in the past year against a decrease of 3.2% for the industry.\n\nABBV Stock Outperforms Industry\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AbbVie is not very cheap. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 15.43 forward earnings, just slightly lower than 16.37 for the industry. The stock is cheaper than that of some other large drugmakers like Eli Lilly LLY and Novo Nordisk NVO but priced much higher than most other large drugmakers. The stock is also trading above its 5-year mean of 11.62.\n\nABBV Stock Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.14 per share to $12.20 per share while that for 2026 has increased from $13.69 to $13.72 per share over the past seven days.\n\nABBV Estimate Movement\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in ABBV Stock\n\nAbbVie faces its share of headwinds, such as Humira biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on cancer drug Imbruvica and slow market growth trends for fillers in the United States and China. It also faced some key pipeline setbacks in 2024.\n\nHowever, AbbVie has faced its biggest challenge \u2014 Humira\u2019s patent cliff \u2014 quite well and looks well-positioned for continued strong growth in the years ahead. AbbVie saw a rapid return to sales growth in 2024 after revenues declined in 2023 due to Humira loss of exclusivity (LOE), driven by its ex-Humira platform. AbbVie\u2019s ex-Humira drugs rose around 19% (on a reported basis) in 2024, exceeding the company\u2019s internal expectations.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as the company has no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s rising estimates, a solid pipeline and the prospect of growth in sales and profits in 2025 are good enough reasons for those who own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to stay invested.

Revenue for the quarter was $15.1 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $14.83 billion.\n\nRelated: Analysts reset Natera stock price target by 20%\n\nFor the full year 2025, the North Chicago company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of $12.12 to $12.32, in line with the $12.13 Wall Street analyst consensus. AbbVie estimates revenue at $59 billion, just shy of the $59.07 billion estimate.\n\n\"Twenty-twenty-four was a year of significant progress for AbbVie,\" Chief Executive Robert A. Michael said in a statement.\n\n\"Our growth platform delivered outstanding results, we advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and we strengthened our business through strategic transactions.\n\n\"We are entering 2025 with significant momentum and expect net revenues to exceed their previous peak in just the second full year following the U.S. Humira loss of exclusivity.\"\n\nAbbVie also affirmed its expectations for a high-single-digit compounded annual revenue growth rate through 2029.\n\nAbbVie stock gained 14.67% in 2024.\n\nAnalysts raise AbbVie stock price targets\n\nSeveral analysts have raised their stock price targets for AbbVie after its earnings and outlook.\n\nCiti raised its target on AbbVie to $215 from $205 and maintained a buy rating, according to thefly.com.\n\nAbbVie delivered another Q4 beat, with its 2025 projected Skyrizi and Rinvoq revenue of $24 billion exceeding consensus estimates, Citi argued.\n\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq are AbbVie\u2019s immunology drugs, which could replace Humira as the company\u2019s top revenue drivers. Their growth potential showcases AbbVie\u2019s ability to move on from Humira\u2019s loss, according to Citi.\n\nBMO Capital also raised AbbVie's price target to $215, from $208, with an outperform rating.

            "content": "AbbVie revamped a loyalty program for its aesthetics products at the end of last year, which to the company\u2019s chagrin, did not have the desired effect. Instead of boosting adherence to AbbVie\u2019s products, the company saw aesthetics product sales decline 4.4% year over year to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nCarrie Strom, president of Global Allergan Aesthetics for AbbVie, said a new version of the All\u0113 loyalty program was launched in October 2024 in an effort to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention and cross-selling. The program allows patients to receive points and rewards that can be applied to AbbVie\u2019s legacy Allergan aesthetics products such as Botox, Juv\u00e9derm, CoolScupting and more.\n\n\u201cWhile some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new construct was too complex to integrate into their practices, therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels,\u201d Strom said on AbbVie\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call Friday morning.\n\nAbbVie has now reversed course, reinstating the original All\u0113 loyalty program earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThis action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers, with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery,\u201d Strom said.\n\nAbbVie will see a one-time price adjustment for the first quarter of 2025 due to the revamped All\u0113 program\u2019s failure to launch, Strom said. The marketing misstep comes as AbbVie faces broader pressures to the aesthetics franchise, which it obtained with the $63 billion acquisition of Allergan in 2019.\n\nIn the U.S., sales declined 5% year-over-year to $839 million in the fourth quarter. Strom said consumers in the country have cut spending on these types of treatments in the wake of high inflation. Fillers like Juv\u00e9derm were particularly affected, dropping 10%, while toxins suchas Botoxwere more resilient, Strom said.\n\nDespite the Q4 erosion, AbbVie\u2019s products remain leaders in the U.S. market, according to Strom. Botox still has about 60% of the market share for toxins and Juv\u00e9derm is at 40%.\n\n\u201cAs you reflect on the aesthetics performance, we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business, but we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup,\u201d CEO Rob Michael said.\n\nStrom is confident that the return of the original All\u0113 program will bring the market share numbers back up. She noted that patients who opted out of AbbVie\u2019s programs during the fourth quarter didn\u2019t all flock to one competitor but instead spread across the available options.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s main competitors in the toxin market are Galderma\u2019s Dysport, Merz Pharma\u2019s Xeomin, Evolus\u2019 Jeuveau and Revance Therapeutics\u2019 Daxxify. The filler market, meanwhile is more fragmented but includes products like Galderma\u2019s Restylane and Sculptra, Merz\u2019s Radiesse and more.\n\nInternationally, sales of AbbVie\u2019s aesthetic products declined 3.2% to $459 million for the quarter. Strom chalked this up to lower sales of Juv\u00e9derm in those markets. A decrease in China due to global economic headwinds particularly took a chunk out of the aesthetics earnings for the quarter.\n\nAbbVie is hoping 2025 will see a turnaround. CFO Scott Reents called 2025 a \u201ctrough\u201d year but pointed to a recovery on the horizon. \u201cThe big headwind over the last two years has been the economic conditions, so we do see continual improvement.\u201d\n\nStill, the company revised expectations for the franchise downwards from a previous expectation of $9 billion by 2029. \u201cGrowth of high-single digits\u201d is expected into that year, with revenue \u201csomewhere north of $7 billion,\u201d according to Reents.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analysts said the guidance update represents about an $800 million reduction compared to revenue in 2024. Guggenheim\u2019s analyst team predicted sales of about $7 billion \u201cor so\u201d in 2029. William Blair put the sales target at $7.6 billion.\n\nIn addition to a potential economic shift that could boost AbbVie\u2019 sales, the company is also looking to expand its aesthetics portfolio, with products like the toxin BoNTE currently in Phase III trials. \u201cThis is a business we continue to be excited about,\u201d Reents said.\n\nStrom said BoNTE will be \u201can important catalyst for new patient activation into the category.\u201d The toxins market continues to be under-penetrated because of consumer concerns around the cost and fears of an unnatural look, she explained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really where BoNTE will play an important role, based on its unique profile that is suited to address these concerns,\u201d Strom said. The toxin is fast acting and has a short duration, allowing consumers to ease into the aesthetic procedures. AbbVie then hopes to flip these first-timers onto Botox.\n\nMichael said AbbVie has continued with these pipeline investments even as the economic downturn wears on, so that the company is ready \u201cwhen the market does recover.\u201d\n\nThe CEO continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve set up this business to be a global, fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development, and I\u2019m confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run.\u201d\n\n",

The Company\u2019s platform includes devices with a proprietary drug delivery technology and a clinical stage investigational immunotherapy. The Company\u2019s two FDA-cleared devices use its proprietary Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery\u2122 (PEDD\u2122) approach to deliver a range of therapeutics: the TriNav\u00ae Infusion System for hepatic arterial infusion of liver tumors as well as other solid tumors and the Pancreatic Retrograde Venous Infusion System for pancreatic tumors. PEDD is a novel delivery approach designed to address the anatomic limitations of infusion into solid tumors. The PEDD approach modulates pressure and flow in a manner that delivers more therapeutic to the tumor and is designed to limit delivery to normal tissue, creating the potential to improve patient outcomes. Nelitolimod, the Company\u2019s investigational immunotherapeutic candidate, is designed to improve patient outcomes by treating the immunosuppressive environment created by many tumors and which can make current immunotherapies ineffective in the liver and pancreas. Patient data generated during Pressure-Enabled Regional Immuno-Oncology\u2122 (PERIO) clinical trials support the hypothesis that nelitolimod delivered via PEDD may have favorable immune effects within the liver and systemically. The target for nelitolimod, TLR9, is expressed across cancer types and the mechanical barriers addressed by PEDD are commonly present as well. Nelitolimod delivered by PEDD will be studied across several indications in an effort to address immune dysfunction and overcome drug delivery barriers in the liver and pancreas.\n\nIn partnership with leading cancer centers across the country \u2013 and by leveraging deep immuno-oncology expertise and inventive technology development \u2013 TriSalus is committed to advancing innovation that improves outcomes for patients.

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for AbbVie\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for AbbVie is:\n\n71% = US$4.3b \u00f7 US$6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.71 in profit.\n\nDoes AbbVie Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, AbbVie has a better ROE than the average (18%) in the Biotechs industry.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Return on Equity February 2nd 2025\n\nThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for AbbVie visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nCombining AbbVie's Debt And Its 71% Return On Equity\n\nWe think AbbVie uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 11.75. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns.\n\nStory Continues",

Also, what is the current market share for BOTOX and JUVEDERM? A: Jeffrey Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, explained that SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are primarily volume-based businesses, with consistent low single-digit price declines expected. Robert Michael, CEO, added that the strategy is to elevate the standard of care and drive growth beyond HUMIRA, with volume being the main growth driver. Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, noted that BOTOX's market share is in the low to mid-60s, and JUVEDERM's is in the low to mid-40s, with efforts underway to recapture lost share.\n\nQ: What are the main drivers for the increased 2027 guidance for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, and how should we think about growth beyond 2027? A: Jeffrey Stewart highlighted that the primary driver is share capture across various indications, with significant growth in IBD. Scott Reents, CFO, provided a breakdown, indicating $11 billion for RINVOQ and $20 billion for SKYRIZI by 2027. Robert Michael added that growth beyond 2027 is expected to continue, with RINVOQ likely growing faster due to new indications.\n\nQ: Regarding the Cerevel impairment, what are the drivers for the remaining value, and what is the outlook for aesthetics growth? A: Robert Michael explained that the impairment reflects a more risk-adjusted view of emraclidine, but there is still optimism for tavapadon. Scott Reents noted that aesthetics growth is expected to recover, with 2025 likely being the trough, and a high single-digit CAGR projected through 2029.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the impact of the Part D redesign and the potential of your pipeline, specifically the NLRX1 agonist? A: Scott Reents stated that the Part D redesign is expected to have a roughly 4% headwind, with modest volume offsets. Roopal Thakkar, Chief Scientific Officer, mentioned that the NLRX1 agonist is in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, with potential for Phase 3 if results are positive.\n\nQ: How do you view the growth dynamics in the immunology and inflammation (I&I) space, and what are the long-term market growth expectations? A: Jeffrey Stewart noted that while some HUMIRA prescriptions are shifting to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the I&I market is expanding due to new lines of therapy. Robert Michael added that high single-digit growth is expected in psoriasis and IBD, with mid-teens growth in atopic dermatitis.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Capsida Biotherapeutics, a gene therapy startup that has quietly amassed a network of Big Pharma partnerships, announced in January that its partner AbbVie will exercise its option on their first neurodegenerative disease program, triggering a $40 million license payment. The five-year-old company, which has built its war chest primarily through pharma collaborations rather than traditional venture funding, has secured major deals with AbbVie, Eli Lilly, and CRISPR Therapeutics. \u201cWe\u2019ve raised money almost exclusively through pharma partnering\u2026 unusual for a five-year-old biotech,\u201d says Peter Anastasiou, CEO of Capsida Biotherapeutics. The AbbVie decision follows successful primate studies using Capsida\u2019s engineered AAV capsids, which demonstrated broad neuronal expression while avoiding liver and dorsal root ganglia targeting.\n\nCapsida\u2019s collaboration with AbbVie, forged in 2021 and focused on neurodegenerative diseases, laid the foundation for this new milestone. \u201cWe delivered on what they expected, and because we delivered on it, they\u2019re taking the program forward,\u201d Anastasiou explains, adding that \u201cit\u2019s great validation of the work we do.\u201d\n\nCapsida Biotherapeutics\u2019 initial partnership with AbbVie included an $80 million upfront payment and a $10 million equity investment. This deal later expanded into ophthalmology programs in 2023 with an additional $70 million. In January 2023, Capsida also secured a pact with Eli Lilly\u2019s subsidiary, Prevail Therapeutics, which provided $55 million upfront and the potential for up to $685 million in milestones. To date, Capsida has raised more than $265 million in total.\n\nDespite the broader ongoing biotech volatility, Capsida is rooted in an unconventional yet promising blueprint. The company\u2019s engineered capsids target the central nervous system with unprecedented precision. \u201cWe\u2019re not just using naturally occurring viruses like AAV9 that have a lot of challenges,\u201d Anastasiou says. \u201cWe\u2019re engineering the virus\u2014the capsids\u2014to address those challenges.\u201d\n\nAnastasiou says the company has \u201ca clear set of tasks ahead.\u201d It must \u201cdeliver on our INDs, get our clinical trials set up and executed, and meet our partners\u2019 expectations.\u201d While acknowledging continued uncertainty in biotech, he notes if the company hits its objectives, \u201cwe\u2019ll be fine regardless of the market environment.\u201d\n\nAnastasiou, who joined after leadership stints at Lundbeck, BMS, and Lilly, felt drawn to Capsida\u2019s vision of potentially disease-modifying therapies rather than incremental improvements. \u201cToward the last few years [at my previous company], the natural life cycle of drug development hits you,\u201d he recalls. Drawn to entrepreneurship, he said: \u201cI love and am driven by building and creating. At this stage, I wanted to do something transformative,\u201d and Capsida \u201cdefinitely has transformative potential.\u201d\n\nIn addition to bolstering its partnerships with AbbVie and Lilly, Capsida is advancing a pipeline of CNS programs\u2014from a gene therapy for STXBP1 developmental epileptic encephalopathy to another aiming to slow the progression of GBA-linked Parkinson\u2019s disease. With multiple INDs on the horizon, the company aims to prove that its tailored capsid technology, combined with strong pharma alliances, can reshape CNS treatment where conventional therapies have struggled to gain ground.\n\nCapsida\u2019s origins trace back to Caltech in 2019, when Nick Flytzanis, Ph.D. and Dr. Nick Goeden, Ph.D. unveiled an approach to engineer custom AAV capsids capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier with precision. Now, armed with a $50 million Series A from Versant Ventures and Westlake Village BioPartners, the fledgling company drew Peter Anastasiou\u2014formerly of Lundbeck, BMS, and Lilly\u2014who was motivated by the promise of \u201csomething transformative\u201d for CNS diseases. \u201cThe brain has been kind of like the last organ\u2026 we still haven\u2019t fully figured it out,\u201d Anastasiou explained. But there is clearly promise in unravelling its mysteries.",

Reported EPS is $2.16 EPS, expectations were $2.98.\n\nOperator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea: Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research & Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie, and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I\u2019ll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\n\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s business performance.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie, and I\u2019m very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions. Turning to our results, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth, with full-year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of U.S. Humira erosion in 2024.\n\nThis outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform, which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full-year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well-positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. And given that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade, we have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq to assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion.\n\nBased on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027, which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year. We are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD. And we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance, with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nIn oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta; our FR\u03b1 ADC for ovarian cancer, Elahere; our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, and our BCMA-CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma 383. Lastly, while the recent performance in aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the U.S. and China, the category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years, and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029.\n\nTurning now to R&D, we have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs. These advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC, Epkinly in later lines of follicular lymphoma, Elahere for FR\u03b1-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, Vyalev for advanced Parkinson\u2019s, and new indications for Botox and Juv\u00e9derm. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA, and Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson\u2019s, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for aesthetics. We have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience.\n\nWe have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s execution in 2024. And expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications. I\u2019ll share some highlights in the U.S. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors, with in-play capture rates remaining very strong.\n\nOver the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head-to-head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in-place share in atopic dermatitis, as our communication around our level-up study versus Dupixen continues to ramp. Recall that in level-up, we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction. In RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-place share in the second line plus market, consistent with the brand\u2019s label. We see that U.S. physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA.\n\nIn psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-place share in the room category, highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment. Across IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share, given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn\u2019s disease, which is roughly two-thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-place share with total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly. In ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second-half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly a third of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands.\n\nWe see similar performance internationally as well, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So, I\u2019m very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains across our existing indications, in addition to the typical market growth we see across room, derm, and gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition, we continue to see molecule compression in the U.S. with volume moving to other novel mechanisms, which has resulted in a benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that roughly half of U.S. covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full-year basis, with select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis, reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, Elahere continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the U.S. are annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines.\n\nMoving to neuroscience, where total full-year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $924 million, Botox Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and Qulipta with global revenues of $201 million. Beyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson\u2019s disease. We recently launched Vyalev, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAs a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities. Parkinson\u2019s experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night. While sales in the U.S. are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I\u2019m very encouraged by the data we are seeing for tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients.\n\nTavapadon represents a very complimentary addition to our Parkinson\u2019s disease portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa. So, overall, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the U.S. facial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years. As a higher price procedure relative to toxins, current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single-digit% growth. Although we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers, in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points.\n\nIn October, we launched an updated version of our Alle consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross-selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new contract was too complex to integrate into their practices, therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original Alle consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower Juv\u00e9derm sales as Botox cosmetic sales were roughly flat on an operational basis.\n\nOur international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China, where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we\u2019ve planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth. In the U.S., this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers. Additionally, based on our Alle loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first quarter U.S. results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment. In summary, while economic headwinds and key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions, we continue to see significant long-term growth potential, given high consumer interest and low penetration rate.\n\nAllergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals, as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs. Starting with immunology, regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in the second quarter. Data for two Phase 3 Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HS and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi, data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year. Also this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated.\n\nAdditional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025, including a Phase 2 study evaluating lutikizumab in atopic dermatitis, a Phase 2 study evaluating Skyrizi and lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody, ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn\u2019s Disease Platform Study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi. Moving to oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones as well as phase transitions for key programs are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline, where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe target for an approval decision is in the first-half of this year. This represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-Met-directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-Met asset. A Phase 3 study evaluating ABBV-400, also known as Temab-A, was recently initiated in patients with c-Met overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Temab-A, as a monotherapy, is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. This year, data from a Phase 1 CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a Phase 3 study in an all-comers population.\n\nTemab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A Phase 2 study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned, where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy. In the EGFR mutant segment, results from the ongoing Phase 1 study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first line setting. In gastroesophageal cancer, a Phase 2 trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD-1 inhibitor in frontline patients. We are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same Topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6.\n\nEncouraging data in small lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, were presented at ASCO last year. And this year, dose optimization and longer term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the frontline. Moving to FR\u03b1 ADC, Elahere is now approved for platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the U.S. and Europe and is currently in Phase 3 development for the platinum sensitive ovarian cancer segment, also, a next generation ADC targeting FR\u03b1, IMGN-151 is currently in Phase 1. This year, Elahere will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor. 151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard of care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin and a PARP inhibitor.\n\nThese mid-stage studies for Elahere and 151 will be used to inform our Phase 3 approach in various settings for ovarian cancer, including induction and maintenance in platinum sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as PIVAC targets a rare hematologic malignancy called Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm. Based on positive data from the pivotal Phase 2 study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also in the area of hematologic oncology, the Phase 3 Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year. Now moving to neuroscience, following the Emraclidine EMPOWER-1 and 2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials.\n\nOur findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites. When assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response, a clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase 1b. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals and schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit. Additionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of Emraclidine. This is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia, as higher doses may result in greater efficacy.\n\nA multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year and data will be available in the early part of 2026. Following this dosing work, Phase 2 studies in adjunctive schizophrenia and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing with Phase 2 studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson\u2019s Disease, positive top line results from the third Phase 3 trial for Tavapadon were recently announced. In the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson\u2019s Disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved.\n\nWe are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to Levo, Carbidopa. The six-month data from the Phase 3 studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest, such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer term safety data will be available this year and regulatory submissions will then follow. Moving to aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines. We are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year.\n\nTo summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline. In 2025, we anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones, including many trial starts for key programs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\n\nNet interest expense was $610 million. The adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $12.32. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7% despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas.\n\nWe expect global immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD; Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. And Humira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including U.S. sales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Venclexta sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand, partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign and Elahere revenue of $750 million.\n\nFor Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery in the U.S. This includes Botox Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for Juv\u00e9derm. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes Vraylar revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand, partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Botox Therapeutics sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion and Vraylar sales of $300 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales.\n\nWe expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $6.1 billion including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion, we expect U.S. Humira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original program, neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion and eye care sales of $550 million.\n\nWe are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception, as well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026.\n\nOur strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie\u2019s results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Abbvie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) Follow Abbvie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Our first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just to dive a little deeper on the Skyrizi, it is a great performance and guidance. Can you just comment a little more on pricing dynamics that you\u2019re seeing there as to how you\u2019ve factored in pricing both for this year and maybe over the next several years? And then, just a quick follow-up on the comments that were given around aesthetics, especially on the share side, I think you lost a few points when maybe getting it back. Can you just give a sense of where you think the share is now for Botox and Juv\u00e9derm sort of this point in time? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart: Yes, thanks, Vamil. It\u2019s Jeff. And I\u2019ll comment on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think, we\u2019ve been very consistent that over the near-term and over time, this is a volume-based business, so we\u2019re going to see price declines year-over-year. But I would say modest, right? We\u2019ve sort of highlighted that as we negotiate the formularies, we\u2019ve started to consistently see sort of these low single-digit price concessions. Now, obviously, what Scott highlighted was unique for the 25-year with the Part D redesign that he outlined. So, overall, consistent low single-digit price declines from the rebating side with a one-time Part D. And we would anticipate once we left the Part D, we would see that sort of trend going forward.\n\nRob Michael: And Vamil, this is Rob. I\u2019ll just add that if you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our strategy here was to elevate the standard of care for patients and ultimately would drive a rapid return to growth for the company beyond Humira. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been able to execute. That strategy has played out. You see the differentiation in the marketplace. We have nine head-to-head studies. We\u2019re launching a few more. We\u2019ve upgraded our guidance now by an additional $4 billion in 2027. We\u2019ve been very consistent in our language around the pricing dynamics. We said when you think about rebates, think about it as negative low single-digits going forward, but given the robust performance of these assets, it\u2019s volume that\u2019s dominating the growth, and we would expect that to continue.\n\nCarrie Strom: And hi, this is Carrie. I\u2019ll answer your question around Botox and Juv\u00e9derm share. So, in the U.S., we remain the clear market leader for both toxins and fillers. In Q4, a few points of share erosion, bringing Botox to around the low to mid-60s, Juv\u00e9derm to around the low to mid-40s. As I said, the reversion of the loyalty program back to the original one, which we announced in December. And then, put into action January 21st, was greeted with very positive response from our customers. And encouraging signs for us to recapture that share for both Botox and Juv\u00e9derm throughout the year. And just to note that the share did not go to one competitor. Rather, it was more distributed amongst the entire competitive set.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a two-parter on the Skyrizi Rinvoq dynamics, maybe just first on the 2027 guidance, can you just elaborate on what were the biggest drivers of upside to those targets, as you think about the various indications for the drugs? I guess, is it fair to think most of this coming from IBD, or is it across the board? And then, probably a longer-term question on those brands, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about the growth rate beyond 2027? So basically, how mature will these franchises be by then? And what type of growth rates can we think about over time? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Maybe \u2014 thanks, Chris. This is Jeff. I\u2019ll start on that. So, the primary driver of the change is, in fact, share capture. So, the pricing assumptions have been consistent. We can call the markets pretty well. We see the actuals and the long-term trends there. So, it\u2019s been really share capture. And I would say that we see it across the board. Certainly, we\u2019ve been super encouraged with Skyrizi in psoriasis. We continue to see very, very robust TRx share trends. And there\u2019s no question that the ramps in IBD have been very, very significant. So, that\u2019s a big piece of it. But I would say it\u2019s across the board. So, predominantly share capture. I don\u2019t know if, Scott, you have anything to add. But that\u2019s the big dynamic there on the $4 billion.\n\nScott Reents: Yes, Jeff. Maybe, Chris, if it would help, I can give you the breakdown by indication between the two on the 2027 guide, so, we talk about $31 billion combined in 2027. That\u2019s our new long-term guidance. That is $11 billion for Rinvoq and $20 billion for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is broken down. Rheum is about $4.8 billion; dermatology, $2.5 billion; IBD, $3.7. And then, on the Skyrizi side, $12.5 billion of that $20 billion guide is from psoriatic. And the remaining $7.5 billion is coming from IBD. So, that might help you kind of see those where the growth is coming from as well.\n\nRob Michael: And if we speak to it in terms of the $4 billion, just to give you a sense then, to add to what just Scott mentioned. So, Skyrizi is up $3 billion. A billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We\u2019re just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD. And then, for Rinvoq, it\u2019s up a billion from the previous guidance. And that\u2019s a mix of roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So, again, across the board, we\u2019re seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then, your question on how to think about the growth, we have obviously given guidance beyond \u201927. But as I look at the sell side consensus, clearly the growth that\u2019s in sell side consensus beyond \u201927 is below our expectations.\n\nWe would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in place share level, the share curve bends, but you still expect to see some level of share growth. And then, keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq, collectively adding about $2 billion in peak sales and so that will also contribute. So, as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond \u201927, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indications, but you\u2019ll still see a robust performance from both assets, at least through \u201932.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple, first one on Cerevel, you guys called out the partial impairment today in the press release. Just want to get your perspective as to what the drivers are for the remaining value, assuming Tavapadon is mostly it, but wasn\u2019t sure what you\u2019d assume for Emraclidine or backup compounds? And then, just on aesthetics, with the new guidance to 2029, is it fair to say that you think \u201925 could be the trough or have already seen a trough in terms of the growth rate? I\u2019m just trying to think of the longer term picture. And then, just on BoNT/E, I wanted to get your perspective about the potential success there adding new patients to the paradigm, just given the potential there. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael: Geoff, on your first question regarding \u2014 this is Rob. On your first question regarding Cerevel, so keep in mind, the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So, even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can\u2019t write that value up. So, that would be the same as what we originally ascribed. We still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neuro degenerative psychosis. And we haven\u2019t completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either, but that\u2019s a more heavily risk adjusted opportunity now. So, when you think about the value you have to take into account, the timing, so there\u2019s some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy.\n\nThat\u2019s all baked into because you\u2019re essentially valuing risk adjusted revenues. You have to take that into account. That said, we\u2019re still optimistic about the asset. We\u2019re pursuing it in these indications. And again, as I mentioned, we haven\u2019t completely given up on monotherapy that will depend on dose ranging. But that is the way we constructed the revaluation of the intangible. But overall, we still see a very nice opportunity particularly for Tavapadon and we still see potential for Emraclidine as well.\n\nJeff Stewart: Geoff, I\u2019ll take your question regarding the aesthetics trough. So, we\u2019ve not specifically guided that, but the way that we have modeled it and think about it is we do see recovery. And I think the big headwind here has been over the last two years has been the economic condition. So, we do see continued improvement. Carrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we\u2019re seeing coming back in the U.S. for both fillers and toxins. So, we would \u2014 if you model, you would anticipate \u201925 to be the trough. And then, our long-term guidance is that high-single-digit compound annual growth using \u201925 as the base year through \u201929. And if you model that, that\u2019s going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly, this is a business we continue to be excited about.\n\nWe think that there are continuing to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we\u2019ve got some innovation to continue to drive market growth. That market has grown low-double-digits historically, but I think as we model, we\u2019re thinking a high-single-digit growth in the markets. But we do see some growth accelerators with BoNT/E, and maybe I\u2019ll let the team talk about BoNT/E.\n\nRob Michael: Maybe I\u2019ll just mention here just more broadly, this is Rob, on the business. I think as we reflect on the aesthetics performance and we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business. But we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup again given low penetration rates, high consumer interest and our leading portfolio, including some exciting pipeline programs in toxins and fillers. When you think about it, as part of AbbVie, the aesthetics business has been able to continue investing despite the macroeconomic challenges and that will allow us to maximize opportunities when the market does recover. We have set up this business to be a global fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development, and I\u2019m confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run. It\u2019s just been difficult for us to call the market recovery, but we still have a lot of confidence in the long-term outlook.\n\nCarrie Strom: And this is Carrie. I\u2019ll comment on BoNT/E. So, as you said, BoNT/E will be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the category. Consideration continues to be very high for aesthetics and for toxins. And like we said, it continues to be underpenetrated. And that\u2019s because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category, but not acting around cost and concerns of an unnatural look. And that\u2019s really where BoNT/E will play an important role based on its unique profile that is suited to address these concerns. It\u2019s fast-acting. It has short duration. So, it\u2019s going to be a nice option to position for these considerers to try BoNT/E. And then, our commercial strategy will be to convert them from BoNT/E to Botox. So, this is going to be an important pipeline catalyst to help us to activate that consumer market and drive more consumers into the toxin category for Botox.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: And it\u2019s Roopal. Maybe one comment to add to Carrie\u2019s. On the R&D side, even thinking past that, this year we\u2019ll initiate a study with BoNT/E plus Botox to cover people immediately and get that long-term benefit. So, that, those studies will start this year.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the net impact of the Part D redesign. Can you tell us what the volume impacts you guys are assuming, if any, in that calculation? And then the second question I had is, on the pipeline slide, you noted you could have some Phase 2 UC data for 113, which I believe is your oral NLRX1 agonist. Just maybe speak to conviction level there and how you think about that on the forward and if that would be something that you could move into Phase 3. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents: Terence and Scott, I\u2019ll take your question on the volume. So, we have guided a 4% of a net impact across the business for headwind to growth for Part D redesign. Now, when we think about that volume offset, we\u2019ve not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. It\u2019s a, I would say, in the grand scheme, it\u2019s a fairly modest offset overall. And I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume, recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there\u2019s roughly three patient segments and they each take about a third of the business. But this is really something that will impact the standard eligible, and we\u2019re working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth. And so, we really see that volume offset coming from that one-third of the patient segment to drive that. So, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a little bit more of a modest offset, but we\u2019ve not quantified it.\n\nRob Michael: And it\u2019s logical when you think about it, because the other two-thirds, I mean, you have the LIS population, which is one-third, so they don\u2019t have an out-of-pocket burden like the standard eligible do, and the other third are covered by employer plans, where, again, they don\u2019t have the same out-of-pocket burden. So, when we analyzed it, we looked at the market and saw that about a third, as Scott mentioned, of the population would benefit from the lower out-of-pocket. But keep in mind, the cost share applies to the entire book of Medicare business. That\u2019s why the volume doesn\u2019t offset the price impact.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: And this is Roopal. I\u2019ll cover the NLRX question. This is our asset from Landos. We had observed very early data, I would say Phase 1b, in ulcerative colitis, and that looked good, but it was a very small sample size, I would say. So, this will be a robust Phase 2 with a placebo comparator, and we\u2019ll get objective data from centralized review of endoscopic data. So, it will be a good data set to look at, and if it looks good, definitely would be a Phase 3 asset for us. And the other consideration we would have, similar to what I highlighted about other biologics that we\u2019d be combining with Skyrizi, if this looks good, this could be a combination agent with Rinvoq as well.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress, I have a question regarding IMI. So, I know you talked in the past about Skyrizi and Rinvoq benefiting from some of the Humira prescriptions going to these agents as well. So, taking that aside, it still seems like the volume or IRA space is growing rapidly. Can you talk a little bit about the underlying dynamics as well here, why this market continues to grow, and how should we think about longer term for the overall market growth itself? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart: Yes. So, thanks, Mohit. It\u2019s Jeff. And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event, in this case, this was the CDF exclusion in April, we could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira was going to the biosimilar. We saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we\u2019ve continued to see the molecule compress. And it\u2019s just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it\u2019s becoming harder to measure because you\u2019re also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head-to-head trials, new indications, new other approaches. So, I would say overall, it\u2019s there, but it\u2019s relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication.\n\nSo, it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market, you\u2019ll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress. Now albeit modest, your other point\u2019s very important. These markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. And one of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we\u2019ll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. So, it used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you\u2019re seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third line markets, which are growing quite substantially. You\u2019re going to see that significantly emerge in IBD, whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along.\n\nSo, they did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there\u2019s drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and other agents, you\u2019re seeing those market lines of therapy expand. And so, that should continue. And we\u2019ve contemplated that in our long-term projections. But that gives you some sense of why you\u2019re observing what you\u2019re seeing.\n\nRob Michael: Now, as we look across, it\u2019s Rob, as we look across the specialty areas, in psoriasis and IBD we\u2019re projecting high single-digit market growth. Atopic dermatitis in the mid-teens, it\u2019s growing very \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re seeing still fairly low penetration rates for atopic dermatitis. So, there\u2019s tremendous room for growth. So, we would anticipate mid-teens market growth there. And then, in rheumatoid arthritis, that\u2019s probably more like low to mid-single digits. But you can see across the board, very nice market growth, which then will be complemented by the market share gains.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Yes. The next question comes from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have two questions, please. First, regarding ABBV-400 or Temab-A, could you please frame your long-term commercial vision for this candidate, including what some may underappreciate about how broadly it could potentially be adopted in the early 2030s? And then, second, on external transactions, emraclidine was a setback, but AbbVie\u2019s overall M&A track record has been very successful. Could you please discuss your agenda for M&A, including the potential to leverage your franchise strength in related product categories? Thanks so much.\n\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. So, I will give some thoughts on that. It\u2019s a very, very attractive asset. I think it\u2019s underappreciated. And part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. I mean, if you look at the response rate that we\u2019ve seen, let\u2019s say, in a smaller or mid-size cancer type, which is ovarian cancer with Elahere, it\u2019s quite striking. I mean, Elahere has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire U.S. oncology market. And it\u2019s because it entered this market that was basically almost all chemo-based with unmet need where there had been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with 400 or Temab-A into colorectal cancer, it\u2019s a substantially larger tumor type, as it\u2019s quite evident.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve already seen very, very nice monotherapy results in later lines, much, much better than we\u2019ve seen with the old chemo standard of care. And really, it\u2019s whether or not they have c-Met or not. Now, the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it\u2019s the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, okay? And that\u2019s really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. Now, the studies will have to bear that out. And as well, we\u2019re seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So, it is, I think it\u2019s an underappreciated asset. We\u2019ll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-Met, the modern c-Met area.\n\nBut it\u2019s quite striking. So, first, we establish in later lines, very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy. And then, we move combination as we move forward. So, thanks for the question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: Hey, it\u2019s Roopal, maybe just a comment there on our strategy around ADCs. And I think 400 is a good highlight of that. So, we think about what\u2019s a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, low expression in healthy tissue. And then, we are continuing to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, utilizing robust biomarkers, as Jeff mentioned, c-Met. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit-risk and particularly tolerability. With our Topo Warhead platform, we\u2019ve seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others, I think, continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical. So, we\u2019re also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right, so we\u2019re able to combine in earlier lines. And that\u2019s the same approach that we have with the other one I mentioned, 706 in small cell lung cancer and others in the pipeline.\n\nRob Michael: And then, David, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on M&A. And thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we\u2019ve had as a company. I would agree with that when you think about the transaction with BI that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics that brought us Imbruvica, really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers, and then the transaction with Allergan, which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company in neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care. And then, more recently, the transaction with Immunogen, which really bolstered our ADC pipeline, as Roopal has highlighted. In terms of our go-forward strategy on BD, we continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade.\n\nAnd we have a clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. And so, my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade. And since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve signed more than 20 early-stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology, we\u2019ve added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we\u2019ve added new platforms, including multispecifics, trispecifics, T-cell engagers, and in situ CAR-T approaches. And then within neuroscience, it\u2019s not always appreciated the work we\u2019ve been doing in neuroscience above and beyond cerebral.\n\nWe expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. And we recently acquired a next-generation A-beta antibody for Alzheimer\u2019s from Aliada. Again that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth. I mentioned neuroscientist aesthetics and eye care, and of course, immunology and oncology. I mean, these are all large markets with high unmet need. And so, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need we would consider pursuing it, especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade.\n\nAnd the company has the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities as well.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Dave. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. And your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much. I have an observation and two questions. The observation is splitting hairs, but on Part D redesign, the guidance had been a three percentage point headwind. It was just set on the call four percentage points. A year ago, it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please, can you identify that? Related to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree, or is there absolutely none? And then, my second question, the company has provided a lot of helpful perspective on the aesthetics market, but can you distill it to a number? The guidance for aesthetics was previously greater than $9 billion in 2030. What is that number now? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I\u2019ll go ahead and start with your Part D observation and question. With Part D, we really \u2014 we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn\u2019t fully understood the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it. So, we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it\u2019s evolved a little bit over time. I would say it\u2019s evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D, but because really the mix of the business. So, when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign.\n\nWe\u2019ve distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today. And really, when you think about when I came out with that 3%, we\u2019ve seen momentum in the business, and we\u2019ve seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology and oncology in particular, where we reached some guidance, where we saw have high Part D channel mix. And so, that\u2019s really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change, and that\u2019s really kind of what it\u2019s amounted to.\n\nRob Michael: And Steve, I\u2019ll just add, I mean, when you think about the setup for the company, in \u201925, we said we would return to robust growth, and we\u2019re delivering in absolute terms in our guidance a little bit more than $2.5 billion of growth, and that\u2019s with headwinds from U.S. Humira erosion around $3 billion, the Part D benefit redesign of approximately $2 billion when you do the math on the roughly 4%, and then a $500 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. So, the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as neuroscience. So, the change you\u2019re seeing from, as Scott mentioned, is really more of a function of mix, but we\u2019re very pleased with the underlying growth that the business has allowed us to absorb these impacts and still deliver robust growth in 2025.\n\nJeff Stewart: Steve, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll take your second question. So, as we\u2019ve negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in \u201924 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents. So, for Imbruvica and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so, that\u2019s encouraging, because if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly $33,000, $34,000, it\u2019ll sequentially move down more to $2,000 with the smoothing next year, which is a good policy, because it\u2019s encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer. Again, the volume will be more modest than the price hit, as Rob and Scott described it. But that\u2019s the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the channels.\n\nScott Reents: And to answer your question regarding the aesthetics guidance, I\u2019ll reinforce maybe what I said earlier and Rob as well. So, when we look at that guidance, that long-term guidance is calling for high single-digit CAGR \u201925 through \u201929, so using \u201925 as the base here. If you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single-digit range. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve specifically given the range on the high single-digit. The market growth that we\u2019ve seen historically has been low double-digits, but we\u2019re seeing that market we\u2019re modeling for now, high single-digit growth during the time period that we\u2019ve given this long-term guidance. And so, I think that answers your specific questions.\n\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions, please. On aesthetics, a question I\u2019ve asked before, what are your expectations for how obesity drugs are going to impact this business? You could argue that the surge in use of products, the GRIP ones, could be either a tailwind or a headwind to the use of products like toxins and fillers. It could be a headwind if patients are having to pick and choose between which products to put their out-of-pocket dollars towards. And then, a second question unrelated to the first. PBM reform still being debated in Washington. If AbbVie had its way, what would change about the current relationship between PBMs and drug companies, and what would you argue should be left alone?\n\nCarrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie. I\u2019ll answer your first question around the obesity market and the aesthetics opportunity. And you\u2019re exactly right. It continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind, a headwind in terms of share of wallet as these consumers are making decisions on what they\u2019re going to spend for. We see that more for the higher-priced products like fillers. And then, also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in aesthetics, and many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so, they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category. So, we do see it as both a tailwind, a headwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term.\n\nAnd the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients. It\u2019s really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with our customers now in helping them position Botox and Juvederm in our product line for these new patients that are entering their practice.\n\nRob Michael: And Tim, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on PBM reform. Look, if there are changes to the rebate system, we don\u2019t have a strong preference between rebates or discounts. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve always competed on the attributes of our products, both the clinical benefit they provide and the value they return to health systems. So, we\u2019re confident in our ability to compete in either world. I would just point to our share performance in international markets that do not have a rebate-based system. And we see similar market shares in those countries as well. So, we can compete effectively in either system. We don\u2019t have a preference.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nChris Raymond: Yes, thanks. Just a question on atopic derm as a target indication, just from some of our work, it looks like the upside we\u2019re seeing in Rinvoq is largely in room and gastro. And I know you guys have sort of mentioned this, and it\u2019s fairly well known. But in atopic derm, at least from our data, it looks like things are starting to flatten out a little bit. And I heard your comments on the derm share of Rinvoq revenue in 2027. But that would seem to infer maybe some kind of inflection. So, maybe a two-part question here; first, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic, and is there an inflection sort of anticipated? And then the second part of that is, should we be paying more attention maybe to lutikizumab as a contributor here?\n\nI know, Jeff, you\u2019ve talked about atopic derm as a very important indication that you guys are targeting. Or is there some other sort of area, like external innovation, that you think will augment maybe your position in this indication? Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart: Yes, it\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s an important segment. And to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection. So, we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture. And this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So, we\u2019ve ramped to the highest in-place shares that we\u2019ve had. And it was largely flat in the teens for mid-teens for many, many quarters. And it\u2019s ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we\u2019ve been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints. Basically, like really minimal disease activity where you\u2019re taking itch down to a very, very low level. And you\u2019re almost completely clearing the skin. And those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform DUPI.\n\nNow, having said that, DUPI\u2019s still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing, we will see that in-place shares start to build into the TRXs over time, because our TRX share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I\u2019d note is that in many, or if not most, of the outside the U.S. markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster. So, in several large markets, we actually are ahead of Dupixent. And some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, et cetera. But we\u2019re quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq as this is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now, having said that, we would and we will continue to look for more assets. Some are in our pipeline as described.\n\nBut this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in. I don\u2019t know, Roopal, if you\u2019ve got any comments on ludi or some of the other concepts.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: That\u2019s right. I mean, with the 5% penetration rate, there\u2019s still many patients that are untreated. So, lutikizumab will be our next one. And Jeff mentioned, there\u2019s other pipeline assets that we\u2019re working on. And key being skin clearance along with that itch. And if you can get them both and have a safe and tolerable profile, I think that\u2019ll continue to be competitive.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris.\n\nChris Raymond: Thank you.\n\nLiz Shea: Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me, so, firstly, your sales in 4Q, did you see any notable difference in trends in stocking or gross-to-net patterns across the portfolio ahead of the changes in Part D versus previous years? Specifically, I\u2019m interested if you had any meaningful one-offs for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for the quarter. And then, circling back on aesthetics, thanks for that updated long-term guide, can you give us a bit more color geographically how we should think about the split between ex-U.S.? China versus the U.S. as you return to growth? Is there an expectation on one coming back quicker than the other? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents: This is Scott. I\u2019ll talk about the stocking. So, we did not see \u2014 in the past, we\u2019ve talked about it a couple years ago in particular. But the stocking was relatively minimal from in terms of the impact. So, we did not see anything with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq on the stocking in the fourth quarter that\u2019ll be impacted in the first quarter.\n\nTrung Huynh: And no real dynamics around gross to net either?\n\nScott Reents: No, that\u2019s right. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I\u2019m sorry, no dynamics around gross to net for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And with respect to aesthetics, I don\u2019t know Carrie if you want?\n\nCarrie Strom: Sure. For aesthetics, if we think about the long-term, we see, like we said, we\u2019re planning prudently for the economic recovery around key markets like U.S. and China, where it\u2019s been challenging for the past few years. Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as will the rest of the world. We see Japan as posting nice growth as being an underdeveloped market that we\u2019re able to invest in. And then, the pipeline catalysts will be important in both U.S. and the rest of the world. Notably, in China, in the past year, we\u2019ve had multiple new pipeline catalysts, which are going to \u2014 which continue to help drive share for both toxins and fillers last year and this year. And we expect the international business to continue to increase as a percent of the revenue for overall global Allergan aesthetics.\n\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.\n\nOperator: Sure. And our last question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani: Great. Thank you very much. When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending? Will there be co-formulation based approaches, just trying to understand the potential revenue implications, noting that clearly there could be some clinical benefit that could certainly make sense. And then, just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is eye care, how and why does this fit going forward? I understand there\u2019s a legacy with the Allergan deal. But just trying to think about the overall portfolio in areas where you clearly have strengths, but this seems to be one which is less than 5% of revenues. But what is the role for that on the board? How are you thinking about it? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar: Hey, Chris, it\u2019s Roopal. Maybe I\u2019ll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into \u201923 \u2014 sorry in the 2030. So, the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in particularly IBD with Skyrizi. And you\u2019ve heard me mention other combo studies in the psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now, that we would combine with the multiple assets that we\u2019ve mentioned over time; TL1A, TREM-1, alpha 4 beta 7, IL-1 alpha beta, lutikizumab that we already have, that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves. For all of these assets, we\u2019re also looking at biomarker approaches. Particularly with lutikizumab, but we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets.\n\nAnd as combinations, the goal would be co-formulations. So, as we enter into the clinical study, we\u2019re also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination, co-formulation approaches. So, that would also be a convenience factor. And we would want to match with longer acting agents. So, for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM-1 we\u2019re seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then, the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies, is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation, but we are very competent in making bi-specifics. Lutikizumab is one of those. So, then in parallel we\u2019re making bi-specifics that could then also stand alone as single assets.\n\nAnd then, as you\u2019ve heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL-23, but we\u2019re also working on a TL1A. And what\u2019s unique and what we like about that platform is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that\u2019s required and these assets having long half-lives. So, if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So, multiple steps as we think about immunology.\n\nRob Michael: This is Rob. Your question on eye care, I mean our focus on eye care is in glaucoma, retinal disease, and prescription dry eye. We like that business. It precipitates in a large market with high unmet need, meets that criteria. It has very much a scientific focus. It\u2019s a data-driven business. It\u2019s a very efficient business as well. And obviously, we\u2019re excited about the REGENXBIO Gene Therapy Program focused on wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. Depending on how that plays out, I think you could see that as becoming a stronger growth driver. We obviously have four of the five, as you think about, you get a lot of questions there. But we don\u2019t get as many questions on eye care, but we do believe as you start to get more visibility to this REGENXBIO Program, you\u2019ll likely spend more time focusing on it. We think of it as a potential to be a long-term growth driver for the company. And we like the fit it has for AbbVie.\n\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Chris. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference.

And to get there, investing in stocks is an excellent strategy. Buying shares of the right companies -- those that can generate generous returns for decades -- will help significantly increase anyone's wealth. Which specific companies should one invest in?\n\nLet's consider two excellent options: AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie was once a division of the leading medical device company, Abbott Laboratories. The drugmaker started trading on the market in 2013, and since then, it has delivered market-beating returns.\n\nTrue, AbbVie's most important drug through most of those years, rheumatoid arthritis medicine Humira, is now out of patent exclusivity. However, the company is handling that loss just fine. Other therapies have managed to fill the massive hole Humira left behind, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq, two immunology medicines that significantly overlap with Humira's indications. According to management, these two superstars will continue to grow their sales into the next decade.\n\nThere are many other products AbbVie can count on, from migraine medicine Qulipta to its Botox franchise. And, of course, investors can expect the company to earn brand-new approvals, be it thanks to internally developed medicines or through acquisitions (which is how it got its Botox products). AbbVie's pipeline features several dozen ongoing clinical trials across many therapeutic areas.\n\nSo, the drugmaker's revenue and earnings will generally move in the right direction. They are doing so now, even after Humira's patent cliff. AbbVie can also significantly increase investors' wealth through its dividend program. Including the time it spent as a division of Abbott Laboratories, the company is a Dividend King and has raised its payouts for 52 consecutive years.\n\nSince it became a stand-alone company, AbbVie's dividend has increased by 310%. The company's forward yield is about 4%, while its cash payout ratio is conservative enough at just under 48% and leaves plenty of room for more increases. Those who opt to reinvest the dividend here will see significant improvements over what should already be strong returns. That's how AbbVie can help investors become millionaires in the next few decades.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nNovo Nordisk has been a pharmaceutical leader for decades. The company has made significant breakthroughs, particularly in diabetes, where it is a leader. Novo Nordisk is currently riding rapidly growing market for weight loss drugs. The drugmaker's famous medicine, Wegovy, is one of this space's best sellers. Novo Nordisk's work in this area has allowed it to generate strong revenue and earnings in recent years.\n\nIt is developing several more that could earn approval within the next few years. Further, semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic (a diabetes medicine), is still undergoing clinical trials for potential billion-dollar indications. They include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and Alzheimer's disease. Both of these areas have high unmet needs.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved just the first MASH treatment last year, although some 22 million patients in the U.S. live with the disease (including 9 million with clinically significant liver disease), according to some estimates.\n\nAnd while Alzheimer's affects about 7 million people in the U.S., very few medicines for the condition have earned the green light in the past two decades. Novo Nordisk's work here could lead to key label expansions. The company's pipeline also features investigational therapies across many other areas, from its core expertise of diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Novo Nordisk has succeeded in delivering superior returns for a long time thanks to its innovative qualities.\n\nThere is more where that came from: The pharmaceutical leader can still post above-average returns and help investors reach the coveted $1 million mark.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

Elahere is the first novel therapy approved in the European Union (EU) specifically for patients with FR\u03b1 positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\n\n\nAt the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, AbbVie announced updated clinical trial results that showed Epkinly (epcoritamab) combination therapy demonstrated high response rates in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma (FL). The company also announced new results from two ongoing clinical trials which showed Epkinly induced durable complete responses as monotherapy and combination treatment in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Epkinly is being co-developed by AbbVie and Genmab.\n\n\n\nAbbVie and EvolveImmune Therapeutics, an immuno-oncology company developing next-generation biotherapeutics to overcome the therapeutic challenges of cancer cell resistance to current immunotherapies, announced a collaboration and option-to-license agreement to develop multispecific biologics for multiple targets in oncology. The discovery partnership will leverage AbbVie's oncology expertise and EvolveImmune's T-cell engager platform to develop novel antibody-based therapies for solid and hematologic malignancies.\n\n\n\nAbbVie and Simcere Zaiming announced a partnership to develop a novel trispecific antibody candidate in multiple myeloma (MM). This option-to-license agreement will develop SIM0500, an investigational new drug candidate that is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with r/r MM.\n\n\n\nAbbVie and Neomorph announced a collaboration and license agreement that will leverage AbbVie's drug development expertise and Neomorph's leading molecular glue discovery platform to develop novel molecular glue degraders for multiple targets across oncology and immunology.\n\n\n\nAbbVie announced that it completed its acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics, strengthening AbbVie's pipeline and R&D capabilities. The transaction includes Nimble's lead asset, an investigational oral peptide IL23R inhibitor in preclinical development for the treatment of psoriasis (PsO) as well as Nimble's peptide synthesis, screening, and optimization platform used to help drive rapid discovery and optimization of peptide candidates for a range of targets.\n\n\n\nAbbVie announced positive topline results from its pivotal Phase 3 TEMPO-2 trial evaluating tavapadon as a flexible-dose monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease (PD). In the study, tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts II and III combined score at week 26. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant improvement from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS Part II score. Tavapadon has demonstrated positive results across all three Phase 3 TEMPO trials and AbbVie remains on track to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year.\n\n\n\nAbbVie announced that its two Phase 2 EMPOWER trials investigating emraclidine as a once-daily, oral monotherapy treatment for adults with schizophrenia who are experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, did not meet their primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant reduction (improvement) in the change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score compared to the placebo group at week 6. Following the results of these trials, AbbVie began an evaluation of the emraclidine intangible asset for impairment which resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a non-cash after-tax intangible asset impairment charge of $3.5 billion . AbbVie continues to evaluate information with respect to the Cerevel-related clinical development programs and will monitor the remaining intangible assets of $3.6 billion .\n\nAbbVie announced that it completed its acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics. The transaction strengthens AbbVie's neuroscience pipeline and R&D capabilities with the addition of a potential best-in-class disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), ALIA-1758, and novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing technology.\n\nFull-Year 2025 Outlook\n\nAbbVie is issuing its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2025 of $12.12 to $12.32. The company's 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact from acquired IPR&D and milestones that may be incurred during 2025, as both cannot be reliably forecasted.\n\nLong-Term Outlook\n\nAbbVie is reaffirming its expectations for a high single-digit compound annual revenue growth rate through 2029. This guidance assumes 2024 as the base year in the compound annual growth rate calculation.\n\nAbbVie is raising its long-term outlook for Skyrizi and Rinvoq revenues. The company now expects combined Skyrizi and Rinvoq 2027 revenues of more than $31 billion, an increase of approximately $4 billion compared to previous guidance for combined revenues of more than $27 billion in 2027. This guidance assumes Skyrizi revenues of more than $20 billion and Rinvoq revenues of more than $11 billion in 2027.\n\nAbbVie is also updating its outlook for aesthetics revenues. The company now expects a high single-digit compound annual revenue growth rate for aesthetics through 2029. This guidance assumes 2025 as the base year in the compound annual growth rate calculation.\n\nAbout AbbVie\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and deliver innovative medicines that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow.

            "content": "AbbVie is shrinking expectations for schizophrenia asset emraclidine for the time being after it failed a pair of Phase II trials late last year. The drug will now be advanced as an adjunct treatment in combination with existing therapies for the neuropsychiatric disorder.\n\n\u201cWe still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neurodegenerative psychosis, and we haven\u2019t completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either, but that\u2019s a more heavily risk adjusted opportunity now,\u201d CEO Robert Michael said on a fourth quarter earnings call on Friday morning.\n\nEmraclidine failed on the primary endpoint of improvement in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as compared to placebo at week six in the mid-stage EMPOWER trials. AbbVie promised to analyze the results further and figure out a path forward.\n\nAbbVie was forced to take a $3.5 billion impairment charge over the asset, which came from the $8.7 billion acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics in December 2023. Speaking to this charge, Michael highlighted Parkinson\u2019s disease therapy tavapadon, another Cerevel asset that hit the primary endpoint of a Phase III trial a few weeks after the emraclidine failure. AbbVie is bullish on this asset but unfortunately could not include it as value to absorb some of the blow from the impairment charge due to accounting rules, Michael explained on Friday\u2019s call.\n\nAt the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month, AbbVie hinted at the next steps for emracldine. Roopal Thakkar, AbbVie\u2019s executive vice president of research and development and chief scientific officer, said then that a review of the data showed the placebo response was site-specific, meaning different sites administering the trials saw varying placebo responses that brought the efficacy signal into question.\n\nOn the earnings call, Thakkar laid out the path ahead. \u201cWhen assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response, a clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase Ib, therefore we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals in schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn those two disorders, Thakkar said there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable options, even if they provide just a \u201cmodest benefit.\u201d\n\nThe company will explore higher doses of emraclidine, given it showed a clean safety and tolerability profile in the Phase II schizophrenia trial. AbbVie will conduct a multiple ascending dose study this year with data available in the early part of 2026, the R&D chief explained. If these high doses show a better response, Thakkar said they could pursue emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia again, but will at least likely pursue a Phase II study in adjunctive schizophrenia.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s programs are moving forward, with dose ranging occurring now. AbbVie plans to conduct Phase II trials in these indications in 2026\n\nAbbVie Beats Consensus\n\nAs for AbbVie\u2019s earnings, the company reported that sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to push the pharma\u2019s revenue over analyst consensus, with an assist from the neuroscience and eye care franchises. At the same time, Humira sales continued its decline in the face of biosimilar competition, and sales in the aesthetics portfolio were notably lower than expected.\n\n\u201cDespite the setback with emraclidine in late 2024, AbbVie continues to have one of the cleanest revenue growth stories in the biopharma space over the next five years, driven by the dominance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq,\u201d William Blair\u2019s analysts said in a note ahead of the earnings call on Friday morning.\n\nAbbVie booked $15.1 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, which was above the expectation of Guggenheim analysts who had predicted $14.85 billion. Full-year revenue was $56.334 billion, which is up 3.7% compared to the year prior. Skyrizi and Rinvoq brought in $11.718 billion and $5.971 billion globally for the full year, respectively, while Humira earned the company just under $9 billion for the full year.\n\nThe neuroscience portfolio also collected about $9 billion, which was an increase of 16.6% over the prior year. The aesthetics portfolio declined 2.2% to $5.176 billion.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) hit $2.16, compared to an estimate of $2.06. AbbVie is expecting EPS of $12.12 to $12.32, compared to Guggenheim\u2019s prediction of $11.93.",

Welcome to the AbbVie fourth-quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\n\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, senior vice president of investor relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, chief executive officer; Jeff Stewart, executive vice president, chief commercial officer; Roopal Thakkar, executive vice president, research and development, chief scientific officer; Scott Reents, executive vice president, chief financial officer; and Carrie Strom, senior vice president, AbbVie, and president, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.\n\nAbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie, and I'm very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions.\n\nTurning to our results, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth, with full-year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of U.S. Humira erosion in 2024.\n\nThis outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform, which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full-year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well-positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE.\n\nAnd given that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade, we have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq to assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion. Based on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027, which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year. We are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD.\n\nAnd we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance, with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson's. In oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta; our FRa ADC for ovarian cancer, Elahere; our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, and our BCMA-CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma 383.\n\nLastly, while the recent performance in aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the U.S. and China, the category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years, and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029.\n\nTurning now to R&D, we have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs. These advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC, Epkinly in later lines of follicular lymphoma, Elahere for FRa-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, Vyalev for advanced Parkinson's, and new indications for Botox and Juvederm. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA, and Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson's, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for aesthetics. We have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience.\n\nWe have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie's execution in 2024. And expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1%.\n\nOn a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year over year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications. I'll share some highlights in the U.S. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors, with in-play capture rates remaining very strong.\n\nOver the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head-to-head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in-place share in atopic dermatitis, as our communication around our level-up study versus Dupixen continues to ramp. Recall that in level-up, we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction.\n\nIn RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-place share in the second-line plus market, consistent with the brand's label. We see that U.S. physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA. In psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-place share in the room category, highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment.\n\nAcross IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share, given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two-thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-place share with total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly. In ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly a third of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands.\n\nWe see similar performance internationally as well, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So I'm very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains across our existing indications, in addition to the typical market growth we see across room, derm, and gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition, we continue to see molecule compression in the U.S. with volume moving to other novel mechanisms, which has resulted in a benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nWe anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts. It's reasonable to assume that roughly half of U.S. covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full-year basis, with select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion.\n\nImbruvica global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis, reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, Elahere continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the U.S.\n\nare annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines. Moving to neuroscience, where total full-year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $924 million, Botox Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and Qulipta with global revenues of $201 million.\n\nBeyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson's disease. We recently launched Vyalev, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities. Parkinson's experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night.\n\nWhile sales in the U.S. are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I'm very encouraged by the data we are seeing for tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease, as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. Tavapadon represents a very complimentary addition to our Parkinson's disease portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa.\n\nSo overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie Strom -- Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics\n\nThank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the U.S.\n\nfacial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years. As a higher price procedure relative to toxins, current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single-digit % growth. Although we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers, in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points.\n\nIn October, we launched an updated version of our Alle consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross-selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new contract was too complex to integrate into their practices, therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original Alle consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery.\n\nInternationally, aesthetic sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower Juvederm sales as Botox cosmetic sales were roughly flat on an operational basis. Our international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China, where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we've planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth.\n\nIn the U.S., this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers. Additionally, based on our Alle loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first-quarter U.S. results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment.\n\nIn summary, while economic headwinds and key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions, we continue to see significant long-term growth potential, given high consumer interest and low penetration rate. Allergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nThank you, Carrie. We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals, as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs. Starting with immunology, regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in the second quarter.\n\nData for two phase 3 Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HS and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi, data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year. Also, this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated. Additional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025, including a phase 2 study evaluating lutikizumab in atopic dermatitis, a phase 2 study evaluating Skyrizi and lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody, ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn's Disease Platform Study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi.\n\nMoving to oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones as well as phase transitions for key programs are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline, where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The target for an approval decision is in the first half of this year.\n\nThis represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-Met-directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-Met asset. A phase 3 study evaluating ABBV-400, also known as Temab-A, was recently initiated in patients with c-Met overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nTemab-A, as a monotherapy, is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. This year, data from a phase 1 CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a phase 3 study in an all-comers population. Temab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A phase 2 study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned, where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy.\n\nIn the EGFR mutant segment, results from the ongoing phase 1 study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies as a monotherapy in the second-line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first-line setting. In gastroesophageal cancer, a phase 2 trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD-1 inhibitor in frontline patients. We are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same Topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. Encouraging data in small lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, were presented at ASCO last year.\n\nAnd this year, dose optimization and longer-term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the frontline. Moving to FRa ADC, Elahere is now approved for platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the U.S. and Europe and is currently in phase 3 development for the platinum sensitive ovarian cancer segment, also, a next-generation ADC targeting FRa, IMGN-151 is currently in phase 1.\n\nThis year, Elahere will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor. 151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard of care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin, and a PARP inhibitor. These mid-stage studies for Elahere and 151 will be used to inform our phase 3 approach in various settings for ovarian cancer, including induction and maintenance in platinum sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as PIVAC targets a rare hematologic malignancy called Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm.\n\nBased on positive data from the pivotal phase 2 study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also in the area of hematologic oncology, the phase 3 Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year. Now moving to neuroscience, following the Emraclidine EMPOWER-1 and 2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials.\n\nOur findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites. When assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response, a clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in phase 1b. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals and schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit.\n\nAdditionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of Emraclidine. This is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia, as higher doses may result in greater efficacy. A multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year and data will be available in the early part of 2026.\n\nFollowing this dosing work, phase 2 studies in adjunctive schizophrenia and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing with phase 2 studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson's Disease, positive top-line results from the third phase 3 trial for Tavapadon were recently announced. In the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26.\n\nKey secondary endpoints were also achieved. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to Levo, Carbidopa. The six-month data from the phase 3 studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest, such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer term safety data will be available this year and regulatory submissions will then follow.\n\nMoving to aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines. We are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year. To summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline.\n\nIn 2025, we anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones, including many trial starts for key programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\n\nOur ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $610 million.\n\nThe adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $12.32. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7% despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign.\n\nAt current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD; Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. And Humira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including U.S.\n\nsales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Venclexta sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand, partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign and Elahere revenue of $750 million. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery in the U.S.\n\nThis includes Botox Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes Vraylar revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand, partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Botox Therapeutics sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion and Vraylar sales of $300 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion.\n\nMoving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024.\n\nTurning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $6.1 billion including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion, we expect U.S.\n\nHumira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original program, neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion, and eye care sales of $550 million. We are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51.\n\nThis guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception, as well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of two times by the end of 2026.\n\nOur strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie's results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. [Operator instructions] Operator, first question, please.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVamil Divan -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to dive a little deeper on the Skyrizi, it is a great performance and guidance. Can you just comment a little more on pricing dynamics that you're seeing there as to how you've factored in pricing both for this year and maybe over the next several years? And then, just a quick follow-up on the comments that were given around aesthetics, especially on the share side, I think you lost a few points when maybe getting it back.\n\nCan you just give a sense of where you think the share is now for Botox and Juvederm sort of this point in time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYes, thanks, Vamil. It's Jeff. And I'll comment on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think, we've been very consistent that over the near term and over time, this is a volume-based business, so we're going to see price declines year over year.\n\nBut I would say modest, right? We've sort of highlighted that as we negotiate the formularies, we've started to consistently see sort of these low single-digit price concessions. Now, obviously, what Scott highlighted was unique for the 25-year with the Part D redesign that he outlined. So overall, consistent low single-digit price declines from the rebating side with a one-time Part D. And we would anticipate once we left the Part D, we would see that sort of trend going forward.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd Vamil, this is Rob. I'll just add that if you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our strategy here was to elevate the standard of care for patients and ultimately would drive a rapid return to growth for the company beyond Humira. And that's exactly what we've been able to execute. That strategy has played out.\n\nYou see the differentiation in the marketplace. We have nine head-to-head studies. We're launching a few more. We've upgraded our guidance now by an additional $4 billion in 2027.\n\nWe've been very consistent in our language around the pricing dynamics. We said when you think about rebates, think about it as negative low single-digits going forward, but given the robust performance of these assets, it's volume that's dominating the growth, and we would expect that to continue.\n\nCarrie Strom -- Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics\n\nAnd hi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your question around Botox and Juvederm share. So in the U.S., we remain the clear market leader for both toxins and fillers. In Q4, a few points of share erosion, bringing Botox to around the low to mid-60s, Juvederm to around the low to mid-40s.\n\nAs I said, the reversion of the loyalty program back to the original one, which we announced in December. And then, put into action January 21st, was greeted with very positive response from our customers. And encouraging signs for us to recapture that share for both Botox and Juvederm throughout the year. And just to note that the share did not go to one competitor.\n\nRather, it was more distributed among the entire competitive set.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just a two-parter on the Skyrizi Rinvoq dynamics, maybe just first on the 2027 guidance, can you just elaborate on what were the biggest drivers of upside to those targets, as you think about the various indications for the drugs? I guess, is it fair to think most of this coming from IBD, or is it across the board? And then, probably a longer-term question on those brands, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about the growth rate beyond 2027? So basically, how mature will these franchises be by then? And what type of growth rates can we think about over time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYes. Maybe -- thanks, Chris. This is Jeff. I'll start on that.\n\nSo the primary driver of the change is, in fact, share capture. So the pricing assumptions have been consistent. We can call the markets pretty well. We see the actuals and the long-term trends there.\n\nSo it's been really share capture. And I would say that we see it across the board. Certainly, we've been super encouraged with Skyrizi in psoriasis. We continue to see very, very robust TRx share trends.\n\nAnd there's no question that the ramps in IBD have been very, very significant. So that's a big piece of it. But I would say it's across the board. So predominantly share capture.\n\nI don't know if, Scott, you have anything to add. But that's the big dynamic there on the $4 billion.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes, Jeff. Maybe, Chris, if it would help, I can give you the breakdown by indication between the two on the 2027 guide, so, we talk about $31 billion combined in 2027. That's our new long-term guidance. That is $11 billion for Rinvoq and $20 billion for Skyrizi.\n\nRinvoq is broken down. Rheum is about $4.8 billion; dermatology, $2.5 billion; IBD, $3.7. And then, on the Skyrizi side, $12.5 billion of that $20 billion guide is from psoriatic. And the remaining $7.5 billion is coming from IBD.\n\nSo that might help you kind of see those where the growth is coming from as well.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd if we speak to it in terms of the $4 billion, just to give you a sense then, to add to what just Scott mentioned. So Skyrizi is up $3 billion. A billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We're just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD.\n\nAnd then, for Rinvoq, it's up a billion from the previous guidance. And that's a mix of roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So again, across the board, we're seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then, your question on how to think about the growth, we have obviously given guidance beyond '27.\n\nBut as I look at the sell side consensus, clearly the growth that's in sell side consensus beyond '27 is below our expectations. We would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in place share level, the share curve bends, but you still expect to see some level of share growth. And then, keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq, collectively adding about $2 billion in peak sales and so that will also contribute.\n\nSo as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond '27, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indications, but you'll still see a robust performance from both assets, at least through '32.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple, first one on Cerevel, you guys called out the partial impairment today in the press release.\n\nJust want to get your perspective as to what the drivers are for the remaining value, assuming Tavapadon is mostly it, but wasn't sure what you'd assume for Emraclidine or backup compounds? And then, just on aesthetics, with the new guidance to 2029, is it fair to say that you think '25 could be the trough or have already seen a trough in terms of the growth rate? I'm just trying to think of the longer term picture. And then, just on BoNT/E, I wanted to get your perspective about the potential success there adding new patients to the paradigm, just given the potential there. Thank you.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nGeoff, on your first question regarding -- this is Rob. On your first question regarding Cerevel, so keep in mind, the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can't write that value up. So that would be the same as what we originally ascribed.\n\nWe still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neuro degenerative psychosis. And we haven't completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either, but that's a more heavily risk adjusted opportunity now. So when you think about the value you have to take into account, the timing, so there's some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy. That's all baked into because you're essentially valuing risk adjusted revenues.\n\nYou have to take that into account. That said, we're still optimistic about the asset. We're pursuing it in these indications. And again, as I mentioned, we haven't completely given up on monotherapy that will depend on dose ranging.\n\nBut that is the way we constructed the revaluation of the intangible. But overall, we still see a very nice opportunity particularly for Tavapadon and we still see potential for Emraclidine as well.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nGeoff, I'll take your question regarding the aesthetics trough. So we've not specifically guided that, but the way that we have modeled it and think about it is we do see recovery. And I think the big headwind here has been over the last two years has been the economic condition. So we do see continued improvement.\n\nCarrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we're seeing coming back in the U.S. for both fillers and toxins. So we would -- if you model, you would anticipate '25 to be the trough. And then, our long-term guidance is that high-single-digit compound annual growth using '25 as the base year through '29.\n\nAnd if you model that, that's going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly, this is a business we continue to be excited about. We think that there are continuing to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we've got some innovation to continue to drive market growth. That market has grown low-double-digits historically, but I think as we model, we're thinking a high-single-digit growth in the markets.\n\nBut we do see some growth accelerators with BoNT/E, and maybe I'll let the team talk about BoNT/E.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nMaybe I'll just mention here just more broadly, this is Rob, on the business. I think as we reflect on the aesthetics performance and we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business. But we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup again given low penetration rates, high consumer interest and our leading portfolio, including some exciting pipeline programs in toxins and fillers. When you think about it, as part of AbbVie, the aesthetics business has been able to continue investing despite the macroeconomic challenges and that will allow us to maximize opportunities when the market does recover.\n\nWe have set up this business to be a global fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development, and I'm confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run. It's just been difficult for us to call the market recovery, but we still have a lot of confidence in the long-term outlook.\n\nCarrie Strom -- Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics\n\nAnd this is Carrie. I'll comment on BoNT/E. So as you said, BoNT/E will be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the category. Consideration continues to be very high for aesthetics and for toxins.\n\nAnd like we said, it continues to be underpenetrated. And that's because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category, but not acting around cost and concerns of an unnatural look. And that's really where BoNT/E will play an important role based on its unique profile that is suited to address these concerns. It's fast-acting.\n\nIt has short duration. So it's going to be a nice option to position for these considerers to try BoNT/E. And then, our commercial strategy will be to convert them from BoNT/E to Botox. So this is going to be an important pipeline catalyst to help us to activate that consumer market and drive more consumers into the toxin category for Botox.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nAnd it's Roopal. Maybe one comment to add to Carrie's. On the R&D side, even thinking past that, this year we'll initiate a study with BoNT/E plus Botox to cover people immediately and get that long-term benefit. So that, those studies will start this year.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the net impact of the Part D redesign. Can you tell us what the volume impacts you guys are assuming, if any, in that calculation? And then the second question I had is, on the pipeline slide, you noted you could have some phase 2 UC data for 113, which I believe is your oral NLRX1 agonist.\n\nJust maybe speak to conviction level there and how you think about that on the forward and if that would be something that you could move into phase 3. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nTerence and Scott, I'll take your question on the volume. So we have guided a 4% of a net impact across the business for headwind to growth for Part D redesign. Now, when we think about that volume offset, we've not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. It's a, I would say, in the grand scheme, it's a fairly modest offset overall.\n\nAnd I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume, recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there's roughly three patient segments and they each take about a third of the business. But this is really something that will impact the standard eligible, and we're working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth. And so, we really see that volume offset coming from that one-third of the patient segment to drive that. So that's why I think it's a little bit more of a modest offset, but we've not quantified it.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd it's logical when you think about it, because the other two-thirds, I mean, you have the LIS population, which is one-third, so they don't have an out-of-pocket burden like the standard eligible do, and the other third are covered by employer plans, where, again, they don't have the same out-of-pocket burden. So when we analyzed it, we looked at the market and saw that about a third, as Scott mentioned, of the population would benefit from the lower out-of-pocket. But keep in mind, the cost share applies to the entire book of Medicare business. That's why the volume doesn't offset the price impact.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nAnd this is Roopal. I'll cover the NLRX question. This is our asset from Landos. We had observed very early data, I would say phase 1b, in ulcerative colitis, and that looked good, but it was a very small sample size, I would say.\n\nSo this will be a robust phase 2 with a placebo comparator, and we'll get objective data from centralized review of endoscopic data. So it will be a good data set to look at, and if it looks good, definitely would be a phase 3 asset for us. And the other consideration we would have, similar to what I highlighted about other biologics that we'd be combining with Skyrizi, if this looks good, this could be a combination agent with Rinvoq as well.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress, I have a question regarding IMI. So I know you talked in the past about Skyrizi and Rinvoq benefiting from some of the Humira prescriptions going to these agents as well. So taking that aside, it still seems like the volume or IRA space is growing rapidly.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the underlying dynamics as well here, why this market continues to grow, and how should we think about longer term for the overall market growth itself? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYes. So thanks, Mohit. It's Jeff. And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event, in this case, this was the CDF exclusion in April, we could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira was going to the biosimilar.\n\nWe saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we've continued to see the molecule compress. And it's just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it's becoming harder to measure because you're also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head-to-head trials, new indications, new other approaches.\n\nSo I would say overall, it's there, but it's relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication. So it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market, you'll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress. Now albeit modest, your other point's very important.\n\nThese markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. And one of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we'll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. So it used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you're seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third-line markets, which are growing quite substantially.\n\nYou're going to see that significantly emerge in IBD, whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along. So they did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there's drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and other agents, you're seeing those market lines of therapy expand. And so, that should continue.\n\nAnd we've contemplated that in our long-term projections. But that gives you some sense of why you're observing what you're seeing.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nNow, as we look across, it's Rob, as we look across the specialty areas, in psoriasis and IBD we're projecting high single-digit market growth. Atopic dermatitis in the mid-teens, it's growing very -- I mean, you're seeing still fairly low penetration rates for atopic dermatitis. So there's tremendous room for growth. So we would anticipate mid-teens market growth there.\n\nAnd then, in rheumatoid arthritis, that's probably more like low to mid-single digits. But you can see across the board, very nice market growth, which then will be complemented by the market share gains.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. The next question comes from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions, please. First, regarding ABBV-400 or Temab-A, could you please frame your long-term commercial vision for this candidate, including what some may underappreciate about how broadly it could potentially be adopted in the early 2030s? And then, second, on external transactions, emraclidine was a setback, but AbbVie's overall M&A track record has been very successful.\n\nCould you please discuss your agenda for M&A, including the potential to leverage your franchise strength in related product categories? Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYes. Hi. It's Jeff. So I will give some thoughts on that.\n\nIt's a very, very attractive asset. I think it's underappreciated. And part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. I mean, if you look at the response rate that we've seen, let's say, in a smaller or mid-size cancer type, which is ovarian cancer with Elahere, it's quite striking.\n\nI mean, Elahere has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire U.S. oncology market. And it's because it entered this market that was basically almost all chemo-based with unmet need where there had been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with 400 or Temab-A into colorectal cancer, it's a substantially larger tumor type, as it's quite evident.\n\nAnd we've already seen very, very nice monotherapy results in later lines, much, much better than we've seen with the old chemo standard of care. And really, it's whether or not they have c-Met or not. Now, the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it's the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, OK? And that's really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. Now, the studies will have to bear that out.\n\nAnd as well, we're seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So it is, I think it's an underappreciated asset. We'll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-Met, the modern c-Met area. But it's quite striking.\n\nSo first, we establish in later lines, very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy. And then, we move combination as we move forward. So thanks for the question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nHey. It's Roopal, maybe just a comment there on our strategy around ADCs. And I think 400 is a good highlight of that. So we think about what's a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, low expression in healthy tissue.\n\nAnd then, we are continuing to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, utilizing robust biomarkers, as Jeff mentioned, c-Met. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit-risk and particularly tolerability. With our Topo Warhead platform, we've seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others, I think, continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical.\n\nSo we're also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right, so we're able to combine in earlier lines. And that's the same approach that we have with the other one I mentioned, 706 in small cell lung cancer and others in the pipeline.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd then, David, this is Rob. I'll take your question on M&A. And thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we've had as a company. I would agree with that when you think about the transaction with BI that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics that brought us Imbruvica, really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers, and then the transaction with Allergan, which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company in neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care.\n\nAnd then, more recently, the transaction with Immunogen, which really bolstered our ADC pipeline, as Roopal has highlighted. In terms of our go-forward strategy on BD, we continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade. And we have a clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. And so, my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade.\n\nAnd since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've signed more than 20 early stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology, we've added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we've added new platforms, including multispecifics, trispecifics, T-cell engagers, and in situ CAR-T approaches.\n\nAnd then within neuroscience, it's not always appreciated the work we've been doing in neuroscience above and beyond cerebral. We expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. And we recently acquired a next-generation A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's from Aliada.\n\nAgain that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth. I mentioned neuroscientist aesthetics and eye care, and of course, immunology and oncology. I mean, these are all large markets with high unmet need.\n\nAnd so, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need we would consider pursuing it, especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade. And the company has the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities as well.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Dave. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. And your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. I have an observation and two questions. The observation is splitting hairs, but on Part D redesign, the guidance had been a three percentage point headwind. It was just set on the call four percentage points.\n\nA year ago, it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please, can you identify that? Related to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree, or is there absolutely none? And then, my second question, the company has provided a lot of helpful perspective on the aesthetics market, but can you distill it to a number? The guidance for aesthetics was previously greater than $9 billion in 2030. What is that number now? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nSteve, this is Scott. I'll go ahead and start with your Part D observation and question. With Part D, we really -- we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn't fully understood the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it.\n\nSo we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it's evolved a little bit over time. I would say it's evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D, but because really the mix of the business. So when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign. We've distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today.\n\nAnd really, when you think about when I came out with that 3%, we've seen momentum in the business, and we've seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology and oncology in particular, where we reached some guidance, where we saw have high Part D channel mix. And so, that's really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change, and that's really kind of what it's amounted to.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd Steve, I'll just add, I mean, when you think about the setup for the company, in '25, we said we would return to robust growth, and we're delivering in absolute terms in our guidance a little bit more than $2.5 billion of growth, and that's with headwinds from U.S. Humira erosion around $3 billion, the Part D benefit redesign of approximately $2 billion when you do the math on the roughly 4%, and then a $500 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. So the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as neuroscience.\n\nSo the change you're seeing from, as Scott mentioned, is really more of a function of mix, but we're very pleased with the underlying growth that the business has allowed us to absorb these impacts and still deliver robust growth in 2025.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nSteve, it's Jeff. I'll take your second question. So as we've negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in '24 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents.\n\nSo for Imbruvica and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so, that's encouraging, because if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly $33,000, $34,000, it'll sequentially move down more to $2,000 with the smoothing next year, which is a good policy, because it's encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer. Again, the volume will be more modest than the price hit, as Rob and Scott described it. But that's the dynamics that we're seeing in the channels.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd to answer your question regarding the aesthetics guidance, I'll reinforce maybe what I said earlier and Rob as well. So when we look at that guidance, that long-term guidance is calling for high single-digit CAGR '25 through '29, so using '25 as the base here. If you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single-digit range. So that's why we've specifically given the range on the high single-digit.\n\nThe market growth that we've seen historically has been low double-digits, but we're seeing that market we're modeling for now, high single-digit growth during the time period that we've given this long-term guidance. And so, I think that answers your specific questions.\n\nSteve Scala -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nThank you. A couple of questions, please. On aesthetics, a question I've asked before, what are your expectations for how obesity drugs are going to impact this business? You could argue that the surge in use of products, the GRIP ones, could be either a tailwind or a headwind to the use of products like toxins and fillers. It could be a headwind if patients are having to pick and choose between which products to put their out-of-pocket dollars toward.\n\nAnd then, a second question unrelated to the first. PBM reform still being debated in Washington. If AbbVie had its way, what would change about the current relationship between PBMs and drug companies, and what would you argue should be left alone?\n\nCarrie Strom -- Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics\n\nHi. This is Carrie. I'll answer your first question around the obesity market and the aesthetics opportunity. And you're exactly right.\n\nIt continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind, a headwind in terms of share of wallet as these consumers are making decisions on what they're going to spend for. We see that more for the higher-priced products like fillers. And then, also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in aesthetics, and many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so, they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category.\n\nSo we do see it as both a tailwind, a headwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term. And the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients. It's really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice.\n\nAnd that's what we're doing with our customers now in helping them position Botox and Juvederm in our product line for these new patients that are entering their practice.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nAnd Tim, this is Rob. I'll take your question on PBM reform. Look, if there are changes to the rebate system, we don't have a strong preference between rebates or discounts. And that's because we've always competed on the attributes of our products, both the clinical benefit they provide and the value they return to health systems.\n\nSo we're confident in our ability to compete in either world. I would just point to our share performance in international markets that do not have a rebate-based system. And we see similar market shares in those countries as well. So we can compete effectively in either system.\n\nWe don't have a preference.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Raymond -- Analyst\n\nYes, thanks. Just a question on atopic derm as a target indication, just from some of our work, it looks like the upside we're seeing in Rinvoq is largely in room and gastro. And I know you guys have sort of mentioned this, and it's fairly well-known. But in atopic derm, at least from our data, it looks like things are starting to flatten out a little bit.\n\nAnd I heard your comments on the derm share of Rinvoq revenue in 2027. But that would seem to infer maybe some kind of inflection. So maybe a two-part question here; first, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic, and is there an inflection sort of anticipated? And then the second part of that is, should we be paying more attention maybe to lutikizumab as a contributor here? I know, Jeff, you've talked about atopic derm as a very important indication that you guys are targeting. Or is there some other sort of area, like external innovation, that you think will augment maybe your position in this indication? Thanks.\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart -- Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYeah. It's a very good question. It's an important segment. And to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection.\n\nSo we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture. And this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So we've ramped to the highest in-place shares that we've had. And it was largely flat in the teens for mid-teens for many, many quarters.\n\nAnd it's ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we've been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints. Basically, like really minimal disease activity where you're taking itch down to a very, very low level. And you're almost completely clearing the skin.\n\nAnd those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform DUPI. Now, having said that, DUPI's still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing, we will see that in-place shares start to build into the TRXs over time, because our TRX share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I'd note is that in many, or if not most, of the outside the U.S. markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster.\n\nSo in several large markets, we actually are ahead of Dupixent. And some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, etc. But we're quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq as this is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now, having said that, we would and we will continue to look for more assets.\n\nSome are in our pipeline as described. But this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in. I don't know, Roopal, if you've got any comments on ludi or some of the other concepts.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nThat's right. I mean, with the 5% penetration rate, there's still many patients that are untreated. So lutikizumab will be our next one. And Jeff mentioned, there's other pipeline assets that we're working on.\n\nAnd key being skin clearance along with that itch. And if you can get them both and have a safe and tolerable profile, I think that'll continue to be competitive.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nChristopher Raymond -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me, so, firstly, your sales in 4Q, did you see any notable difference in trends in stocking or gross-to-net patterns across the portfolio ahead of the changes in Part D versus previous years? Specifically, I'm interested if you had any meaningful one-offs for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for the quarter. And then, circling back on aesthetics, thanks for that updated long-term guide, can you give us a bit more color geographically how we should think about the split between ex-U.S.? China versus the U.S.\n\nas you return to growth? Is there an expectation on one coming back quicker than the other? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThis is Scott. I'll talk about the stocking. So we did not see -- in the past, we've talked about it a couple years ago in particular. But the stocking was relatively minimal from in terms of the impact.\n\nSo we did not see anything with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq on the stocking in the fourth quarter that'll be impacted in the first quarter.\n\nTrung Huynh -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nAnd no real dynamics around gross to net either?\n\nScott Reents -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nNo, that's right. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I'm sorry, no dynamics around gross to net for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And with respect to aesthetics, I don't know Carrie if you want?\n\nCarrie Strom -- Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics\n\nSure. For aesthetics, if we think about the long-term, we see, like we said, we're planning prudently for the economic recovery around key markets like U.S. and China, where it's been challenging for the past few years. Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as will the rest of the world.\n\nWe see Japan as posting nice growth as being an underdeveloped market that we're able to invest in. And then, the pipeline catalysts will be important in both U.S. and the rest of the world. Notably, in China, in the past year, we've had multiple new pipeline catalysts, which are going to -- which continue to help drive share for both toxins and fillers last year and this year.\n\nAnd we expect the international business to continue to increase as a percent of the revenue for overall global Allergan aesthetics.\n\nLiz Shea -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nSure. And our last question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending? Will there be co-formulation based approaches, just trying to understand the potential revenue implications, noting that clearly there could be some clinical benefit that could certainly make sense. And then, just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is eye care, how and why does this fit going forward? I understand there's a legacy with the Allergan deal.\n\nBut just trying to think about the overall portfolio in areas where you clearly have strengths, but this seems to be one which is less than 5% of revenues. But what is the role for that on the board? How are you thinking about it? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar -- Executive Vice President, Research and Development\n\nHey, Chris. It's Roopal. Maybe I'll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into '23 -- sorry in the 2030. So the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in particularly IBD with Skyrizi.\n\nAnd you've heard me mention other combo studies in the psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now, that we would combine with the multiple assets that we've mentioned over time; TL1A, TREM-1, alpha 4 beta 7, IL-1 alpha beta, lutikizumab that we already have, that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves. For all of these assets, we're also looking at biomarker approaches.\n\nParticularly with lutikizumab, but we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets. And as combinations, the goal would be co-formulations. So as we enter into the clinical study, we're also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination, co-formulation approaches. So that would also be a convenience factor.\n\nAnd we would want to match with longer-acting agents. So for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM-1 we're seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then, the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies, is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation, but we are very competent in making bi-specifics.\n\nLutikizumab is one of those. So then in parallel we're making bi-specifics that could then also stand alone as single assets. And then, as you've heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL-23, but we're also working on a TL1A.\n\nAnd what's unique and what we like about that platform is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that's required and these assets having long half-lives. So if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So multiple steps as we think about immunology.\n\nRobert A. Michael -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nThis is Rob. Your question on eye care, I mean our focus on eye care is in glaucoma, retinal disease, and prescription dry eye. We like that business. It precipitates in a large market with high unmet need, meets that criteria.\n\nIt has very much a scientific focus. It's a data-driven business. It's a very efficient business as well. And obviously, we're excited about the REGENXBIO Gene Therapy Program focused on wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.\n\nDepending on how that plays out, I think you could see that as becoming a stronger growth driver. We obviously have four of the five, as you think about, you get a lot of questions there. But we don't get as many questions on eye care, but we do believe as you start to get more visibility to this REGENXBIO Program, you'll likely spend more time focusing on it.

            "content": "AbbVie (ABBV) stock retook its 200-day moving average Friday after the company raised its long-term outlook for immunology powerhouses Skyrizi and Rinvoq by $4 billion.\n\nThe company now projects more than $31 billion in 2027 sales for the two immunology drugs, up from its previous guidance for $27 billion. But AbbVie cut its outlook for aesthetics sales, which includes household name Botox, William Blair analyst Matt Phipps said. He remained upbeat.\n\n\"AbbVie continues to have one of the cleanest revenue growth stories in the biopharma space over the next five years, driven by the dominance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq,\" he said in a report. \"While the aesthetics business is experiencing some headwinds globally, we believe the overall growth profile and potential for pipeline readouts over the next two years could continue driving upside to longer-term numbers.\"\n\nAbbVie Stock Surges: Sales, Earnings Beat\n\nAbbVie stock jumped 4.7% to close at 183.90. Shares have spent the better part of this month trapped below their 200-day line, according to MarketSurge.\n\nAcross all products, AbbVie generated $15.1 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $2.16 per share. Sales grew 5.6% and beat forecasts for $14.83 billion, according to FactSet. Earnings sank almost 23% but topped expectations for $2.12. Earnings took an 88-cent hit due to tax charges and milestone costs.\n\nImportantly, AbbVie's immunological powerhouses, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, generated a respective $3.78 billion and $1.83 billion in sales. Skyrizi revenue rocketed nearly 58% vs. the year-earlier period, while Rinvoq sales jumped more than 46%. Both beat expectations and helped offset a sales miss for Humira.\n\nHumira is AbbVie's former immunology kingpin. But it began facing off with lower-cost biosimilars in 2023. Humira brought in $1.68 billion in sales, down more than 49% and missing forecasts for $1.95 billion, Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report.\n\nStill, he has an overweight rating on AbbVie stock, noting \"Skyrizi and Rinvoq more than made up for the (Humira) miss.\"\n\nOther Products Were Mixed\n\nOncology sales were mixed. Imbruvica beat expectations with $848 million, down roughly 6%, while Venclexta sales fell 11% and lagged forecasts. But Botox sales missed forecasts at $687 million, and fell more than 4% year over year.\n\n\"Sales of aesthetic products were weaker than the consensus view, but may rebound over time as economic conditions improve,\" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in a report.\n\nHe has a hold rating on AbbVie stock.\n\nNotably, Botox as a therapeutic to treat migraines and reduce sweating generated $873 million, slightly ahead of forecasts for $870 million, Piper Sandler's Raymond said. It's important to note, though, that he had a higher $891 million estimate.\n\nAbbVie expects to earn $12.12 to $12.32 per share this year, on an adjusted basis. The midpoint of the earnings outlook missed expectations for $12.15. But, longer term, AbbVie expects its sales to grow by a high single-digit compound annual rate through 2029.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Gaps Up And Nears A Buy Point On Strong Earnings Beat\n\nTeva Stock Dives 14%.

            "content": "AbbVie Inc. ABBV reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. The reported earnings also exceeded the company\u2019s guidance of $2.06-$2.10 issued earlier this month. Earnings declined around 23% year over year due to increased IPR&D expenses incurred during the quarter.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nABBV\u2019s revenues of $15.10 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.87 billion. Sales rose 5.6% year over year on a reported basis and 6.1% on an operational basis.\n\nRevenues in the fourth quarter were driven by robust sales of key drugs Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs, namely Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta. Sales of Humira and Imbruvica declined year over year.\n\nAll growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).\n\nImmunology Drugs Drive ABBV\u2019s Top Line\n\nIn immunology, net revenues from Rinvoq for the fourth quarter totaled $1.83 billion, up 47.1%. The upside can be attributed to label expansions of the drug to include new patient populations in recent quarters. Rinvoq\u2019s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.72 billion and $1.70 billion, respectively.\n\nNet revenues recorded from Skyrizi were $3.78 billion, up 57.9%. This surge in sales was due to label expansions of the drug to include new patient populations in recent quarters. Skyrizi sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 billion and our model estimate of $3.56 billion.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s flagship product Humira recorded a sales decline of 48.7% to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter. Sales in the United States declined 54.5% to $1.25 billion, while ex-U.S. market sales were down 20.5% on an operating basis to $436 million. Humira sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 billion and our model estimate of $1.92 billion.\n\nThis substantial decline in Humira sales was due to the drug\u2019s loss of exclusivity in the United States since January 2023. The drug lost its exclusivity in ex-U.S. territories following the launch of generics in 2018.\n\nABBV\u2019s Neuroscience Drugs\u2019 Performance\n\nSales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 19.9% to $2.51 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic, depression drug Vraylar, and migraine drugs Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Neuroscience sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $2.47 billion and $2.49 billion, respectively.\n\nWhile Botox Therapeutic sales rose 13% to $873 million, sales of Vraylar increased 17.1% to $924 million.\n\nStory Continues",

The multimodal program will provide a unique and innovative approach to treatment using Allergan\u2019s extensive product portfolio, which includes facial injectables like Botox Cosmetic and body contouring procedures such as CoolSculpting.\n\nAs more and more patients seek a holistic approach to aesthetic treatment, the AA Signature program will offer advanced training and education tools for providers on how to combine Allergan\u2019s products. This will aim to meet multiple patient needs that are frequently brought up in clinical settings, thus enhancing retention and conversion rates. These common needs include skin quality, lift, and definition in all regions of the face.\n\nThe development of this program aligns with Allergan\u2019s research, which demonstrates the benefits of holistic, multimodal treatment. More specifically, 9 in 10 people are looking for added lift, firmness, and structure in multiple areas of the face.2 Regarding the chin, jawline, and lower face, 1 in 3 patients seek enhanced angles and definition.3 Overall skin quality with more hydration is also a desired effect with 94% of patients wanting to improve the texture, tone, and smoothness.4\n\nIn a press release, SVP Head of International Commercial, Mark Wilson, said, \"The AA Signature program addresses the rising demand for a holistic treatment approach and leverages our advanced product portfolio, providing HCPs with access to expert opinions, business support, and comprehensive educational programs - including consumer-focused and AMI-led provider training - that align with individual patient aesthetic goals.\"1\n\nAccording to Allergan, focusing on more than one treatment area in each session will maximize patient loyalty and satisfaction. The company will continue to expand its portfolio and further utilize this new program to deliver natural-looking results for patients. Providers can connect with their local Allergan Aesthetics representative to discover whether or not the AA Signature Program is available in their country.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues",

Patients who received one or more treatments with HA soft-tissue fillers or neuromodulators were retrospectively divided into 1 of 3 groups according to treatment(s) received over a 12-month period: neuromodulator only, HA only, or dual treatment with neuromodulator and HA. Retention rates in each practice at 1, 3, and 5 years after the incident year were calculated as the proportion of patients in each group who received at least one paid treatment in the 12-month period leading up to each time point. At 5 years, patient retention for dual treatment was 65.6% vs. 39.0% for neuromodulator treatment only.\n\nReferences:\n\nChiu A et al. Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol. 2023;16:1521\u201332.

The company is focused on developing selective vascular KATP channel inhibitors as a potential treatment for migraines. The funding will be used to advance the program toward candidate selection, following promising results from initial animal models. This initiative builds on research into migraine mechanisms and targets specific channels in intracranial arteries. With migraine affecting a significant global population, Cephagenix\u2019s approach aims to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of this debilitating condition.\n\nCephagenix was established in 2020 by Professor Jes Olesen and Saniona to develop novel migraine treatments targeting mechanisms identified through Professor Olesen\u2019s research. The company\u2019s lead program focuses on identifying subtype-selective ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) inhibitors for migraine treatment. Cephagenix has identified highly selective inhibitors of the KATP channel subtype expressed in intracranial arteries, with first-generation compounds demonstrating efficacy in a relevant rodent migraine model.\n\nProfessor Jes Olesen, co-founder of Cephagenix, commented: \u201cI am thrilled to see Cephagenix\u2019s anti-migraine program attracting interest from leading venture investors. My decades of clinical research into migraine mechanisms have contributed to identifying validated targets such as CGRP and PACAP. This work has also demonstrated that vascular KATP channels are critical for migraine induction. Targeting this mechanism could provide a transformative approach to treating this debilitating condition.\u201d\n\nPalle Christophersen, Executive Vice President of Research at Saniona, added: \u201cSaniona\u2019s ion channel expertise, combined with our chemical library and pharmacology database, has enabled significant progress in developing selective vascular KATP channel inhibitors. We are optimistic about selecting one or more development candidates under this seed financing round.\u201d\n\nThe \u20ac9 million tranched seed financing, announced today, was led by AdBio Partners and AbbVie Ventures. The proceeds will advance the KATP program toward candidate selection.\n\nMigraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headaches of moderate to severe intensity, lasting from a few hours to several days. Current treatments primarily focus on symptom relief and attack prevention, including over-the-counter painkillers, triptans, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists.\n\nAccording to Evaluate Pharma, annual global sales of prescription migraine medicines are projected to grow from $5.8 billion in 2023 to $12.4 billion in 2030, driven primarily by CGRP antagonists, followed by botulinum toxin and triptans.\n\nMigraine affects approximately 12% of the global population, with 3% suffering from chronic migraine. It carries significant socioeconomic and personal costs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), migraine is the second most disabling disease globally. Socioeconomic costs in the European Union alone are estimated at \u20ac40-100 billion annually. These factors highlight a significant unmet medical need for new, effective, and safe treatment options.\n\nClick to read more funding news.",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into AbbVie Inc's (ABBV, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-28, AbbVie Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $295.71. It's currently trading at a price of $176.9. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 40.18%. The company is significantly undervalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. AbbVie Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $10.75 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.56%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 18.10%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 153.59 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 142.12 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 295.71\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $268.02. This valuation indicates that the AbbVie Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 34%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\n\nNavigating with GuruFocus:\n\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

            "content": "IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vizient, Inc. released its new Spend Management Outlook representing the best estimate of the change in the price of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and supplies, capital equipment and services between July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026. The report projects a 3.84% increase in pharmacy and an increase of 2.3% in non-pharmacy spend over that timeframe. The report also includes a comprehensive analysis of emerging trends and pricing dynamics affecting healthcare. View the Vizient Winter 2025 Spend Management Outlook.\n\nThe Spend Management Outlook is a comprehensive forecasting and intelligence resource that helps healthcare organizations look at total expense management for both the acute and ambulatory care environments, in an integrated way, including medical and surgical products, laboratory, indirect spend and purchased services, capital equipment solutions, pharmaceuticals and physician preference items.\n\n\u201cGiven the wide-ranging challenges across all dimensions of spend, siloed solutions are no longer sufficient for effective forecasting. Our unified approach aims to provide actionable insights into the product categories with the highest spend while highlighting shared trends across these critical areas of resource investment,\u201d said Steven Lucio, senior principal of insights and intelligence at Vizient.\n\nThe Winter 2025 Spend Management Outlook includes these key highlights:\n\nPharmaceutical growth in outpatient and ambulatory care settings\n\nThe movement of healthcare into ambulatory spaces continues to grow at an accelerated pace, and that shift is reflected in the list of the top 15 drugs by total spend for Vizient pharmacy program participants.\n\nHumira\u00ae, manufactured by AbbVie, is again at the top of the list and semaglutide (Ozempic\u00ae and Wegovy\u00ae) from Novo Nordisk retains its top 5 position. New to the list is tirzepatide (Mounjaro\u00ae and Zepbound\u00ae) from Lilly at No.10, further illustrating the impact of the GLP-1 category on health system practice. All these agents contribute significantly to the increase in pharmacy spend in ambulatory settings (3.96%) exceeding the growth rate projected for acute care (3%).\n\n\u201cThe shift to ambulatory setting sites reflects the industry\u2019s broader focus on cost efficiency and patient-centered care, which will have big impacts from financial, clinical and operational perspectives, as it reshapes the healthcare industry,\u201d said Carina Dolan, associate vice president, market intelligence, Vizient.\n\nDrug price inflation driven by specialty medications\n\nSpecialty and personalized pharmaceuticals, which typically are high-cost, high-touch medications for rare and complex disease states, account for 54% of total drug spending in the U.S., according to IQVIA. Humira\u00ae, STELARA\u00ae (Janssen Biotech) and SKYRIZI\u00ae (AbbVie) are projected to have the largest price increases for the mentioned timeframe. Biosimilars continue to gain influence. A comprehensive biosimilar chart featured in the Outlook includes 24 molecules with corresponding FDA-approved biosimilar products, future pipeline products with estimated dates and interchangeability status. Overall, specialty and complex medications are predicted to increase by 4.44%.\n\nAt the end of 2024, there were 745 medications on the Vizient specialty pharmaceutical list, with more than half used in oncology, neurology and autoimmune and inflammatory disease states, ensuring that the influence of these products will continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, with the expansion of cell and gene therapy, providers will need to invest more time and attention to the significant administrative and financial challenges of these agents as well as the staffing and technology needed to conduct benefits investigation, patient education, clinical monitoring and financial planning.\n\nThe Outlook also includes a list of high-impact drugs that are expected to enter the market in 2025 and their anticipated wholesale acquisition costs (WAC). Notable are two oncology agents, a subcutaneous version of a previously approved drug, amivantamab (Rybrevant\u00ae), for non-small cell lung cancer (estimated WAC $325,000 to $525,000) and a new first line treatment for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, camrelizumab (estimated WAC $170,000 to $250,000).\n\nMarket dynamics impacting medical and surgical product costs\n\nVizient estimates that market prices encompassing the non-pharmacy healthcare supply chain will increase an average of 2.3% between July 2025 to June 2026. Factors driving cost increases include long term elevated prices for raw materials, cost pressures for freight and shipping and tariffs impacting several medical-surgical (med-surg) products manufactured in China.\n\nThe med-surg supply category is expected to rise 2.3% and includes the previously finalized tariffs on several products manufactured in China including supplies critical to healthcare such as gloves, needles, syringes and certain face masks. While Vizient expects a limited effect for suppliers who already largely manufacture med-surg products in countries outside of China, one product category will be affected \u2014 enteral syringes. However, Vizient provided feedback on the proposed tariffs, ultimately securing a delay on the effective date of the tariffs on enteral syringes until 2026. This gives manufacturers time to diversify their production outside of China.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly aware of the potential for additional changes in tariffs with the change in administration,\u201d said Jeff King, research and intelligence director at Vizient. \u201cThese dynamics are part of the reason strategic forecasting should be a routine part of provider operations and not just an annual exercise-based budgeting cycle.\u201d\n\nOther notable areas of increase that providers should prepare for include construction (4.9%), water services (5.1%) and medical gases (4%).\n\nPharmacy projections are based on Vizient client purchases from Oct. 1, 2023, through Sept. 30, 2024. Non-pharmacy supply chain projections are based on a Vizient analysis of various public sources including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Energy Information Administration.

            "content": "When paired with dividend reinvestment, high-yield dividend stocks have demonstrated remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over holding periods of 20+ years. This outperformance stems from a fundamental truth: A sustainable high dividend yield often serves as a powerful indicator of intrinsic value.\n\nCompanies that maintain above-average dividend yields over extended periods typically share key characteristics. They generate robust free cash flows, maintain resilient business models, and employ shareholder-focused management teams. However, high yields can be a double-edged sword, sometimes signaling formerly dominant companies navigating challenging transitions that may require significant recovery time.\n\nOver the past year, I've strategically added four blue chip, high-yield stocks to my portfolio, with plans to increase these positions over time. Let me share my investment thesis for each holding.\n\nHealthcare leader\n\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV 0.60%) represents my top holding in the healthcare sector. I'm particularly impressed by how the company's immunology franchise continues driving growth despite Humira's patent expiration in the U.S. market.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.2, representing a significant discount to the S&P 500's 23.6 multiple. The drugmaker's valuation looks compelling given its robust clinical pipeline, featuring over 90 compounds, devices, or indications in development individually or through collaborations.\n\nRegarding the pharmaceutical giant's dividend metrics, AbbVie stock pays a generous 3.85% yield backed by a solid balance sheet and diverse revenue streams. The company's 213% payout ratio might raise eyebrows, but its strong free-cash-flow generation and a clear path to earnings growth from new drug launches should keep distributions safe.\n\nBanking giant\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (HSBC 0.20%) gives me prime exposure to Asian financial markets where rising affluence drives demand for banking services. The bank's extensive global network spans 60 countries and territories, with $3 trillion in assets and approximately 41 million customers across personal, wealth, and corporate segments.\n\nHSBC stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 8.2, well below the broader banking industry average of 12.9. This discount appears excessive given the bank's dominant position in high-growth Asian markets, and its strong capital position enables continued investment in digital-banking capabilities.\n\nOn the dividend front, HSBC offers a compelling 3.9% yield supported by a conservative 50% payout ratio. The bank's diversified revenue streams and fortress balance sheet give me confidence in both dividend sustainability and the potential for future distribution growth.\n\nValue opportunity\n\nPfizer Inc. (PFE 1.54%) is my favorite turnaround play in the pharmaceutical space. The company generates over $60 billion in annual revenue from key therapeutic areas including oncology, immunology, and rare diseases.\n\nPfizer stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 8.87, sitting considerably below the S&P 500's 23.6 multiple and putting its shares squarely in bargain territory. This valuation disconnect has created an opportunity to buy a world-class pharmaceutical company at a steep discount to the broader market.\n\nIn terms of the pharma giant's dividend profile, Pfizer sports an eye-catching 6.59% yield, though its troubling 222% payout ratio demands close attention. The company's diverse pharmaceutical portfolio and robust free-cash-flow generation provide some comfort for dividend sustainability.\n\nDespite these clear risks, I own this high-yielding big pharma stock because I believe its global reach and vast product portfolio will eventually drive a significant business turnaround. I've accumulated shares at these depressed levels to lock in the historically unprecedented yield.\n\nSmoke-free innovator\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM 1.87%) 's leadership in the global transition toward reduced-risk tobacco products caught my attention. I'm watching closely as the IQOS heated tobacco system drives growth, while traditional cigarette volumes decline gradually.\n\nPhilip Morris stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.3, below the S&P 500's 23.6 multiple. However, it is at a premium to tobacco industry peers, which trade at an average multiple of 12.1 times forward earnings. I believe this premium is justified by the company's significant lead in reduced-risk products.\n\nTurning to the tobacco giant's dividend metrics, it's clear that Philip Morris has a somewhat concerning 83% payout ratio, raising concerns about the sustainability of its cash distributions. Still, the stock's healthy 4.24% yield should be safe over the long term thanks to management's commitment to shareholder returns and its high-margin business, which produces stable and robust free cash flows.\n\nBuilding long-term wealth with dividends\n\nHigh-yield dividend investing requires balancing attractive current income against dividend-sustainability risks. These four companies represent my highest-conviction income investments for 2025 and beyond due to their compelling mix of yield and sustainability.",

            "content": "Investors in AbbVie Inc. ABBV need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb. 21, 2025 $115.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AbbVie shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.97 per share to $2.09 in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about AbbVie right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

            "content": "Monday was a grim day for a great many stocks, but luckily for its investors, AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) wasn't one of them. The storied pharmaceutical company saw its share price rise by almost 4%, on the back of a pair of pre-earnings price target bumps from analysts. The contrast between AbbVie's performance and that of the wider market was stark, as the bellwether S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) sank by a relatively steep 1.5%.\n\nDoubling up\n\nWell before the market open, news broke of those two AbbVie price target increases. They came at the kickoff of the week, when the company was scheduled to post its fourth-quarter earnings (on Friday, Jan. 31).\n\nThe first came from white-shoe investment bank Goldman Sachs, whose analyst Chris Shibutani bumped his fair value assessment to $208 per share from the previous $205. According to reports, Shibutani actually lowered certain profitability estimates for the company, yet remained bullish on its immunology products such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nThe second was published by Piper Sandler's Christopher Raymond. He made a slightly more drastic change, upping his AbbVie price target to $227 per share from $220. His reasoning was similar to that of Shibutani. Additionally, according to reports, he believes it is in front of a $3.5 billion noncash, after-tax impairment charge related to its investigational antipsychotic drug emraclidine that hasn't been included in management's guidance.\n\nPay for quality\n\nAbbVie is one of the better pharmaceutical stocks on the scene, buttressed by a strong product lineup and a promising pipeline of developmental programs. It also pays quite a generous dividend, especially considering that the pharmaceutical sector tends to be miserly in this respect. I think it's always worthy of buy consideration.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. These selections are derived from sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, given their historical resilience and stability even during economic downturns. A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified promising tech stocks that currently pose as appealing entry opportunities for investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on creating medicines and solutions that put impact first \u2014 for patients, communities, and the world. The following elements demonstrate why this company is an excellent investment choice. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 indicates the company\u2019s strong performance driven by its core business activities. For instance, worldwide net revenues were $14.46 billion, an increase of 3.8% on a reported basis or 4.9% on an operational basis. Moreover, global net revenues from the oncology portfolio were $1.687 billion, an increase of 11.6% on a reported basis or 13% percent on an operational basis, which reflects a solid performance in the oncology business, with significant growth driven by operational factors. The report also shows an increase in the company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend from $1.55 per share to $1.64 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2025, to shareholders of record. This shows an increase of approximately 5.8%, continuing AbbVie\u2019s strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend. Lastly, AbbVie and Gedeon Richter announced a new discovery, co-development and license agreement to advance novel targets for the potential treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions.

            "content": "Although AbbVie has lost patent exclusivity for its flagship drug, Humira, the company may soon be bigger and better.\n\nPharmaceutical powerhouse AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) has been a beast since it spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2012. Over the past decade, the stock has averaged a dividend yield of 3.5% while raising its dividend by an average of 14% annually. That sustained yield and growth have made shareholders very happy.\n\nFor most of those years, AbbVie enjoyed lucrative success with Humira. However, the company's revenue has dipped since Humira lost patent exclusivity in 2023, and the stock price has only increased by 6% over the past two years (not counting dividends).\n\nAre AbbVie's best years behind it? Or is the company retooling for another stretch of prosperity? Let's decide whether AbbVie is a buy.\n\nOne step back, two steps forward\n\nIn the pharmaceutical business, one home run can essentially build a company. AbbVie's success with Humira is a textbook example. Humira (adalimumab) is an immunosuppressant drug used to treat several autoimmune diseases, in which a patient's immune system attacks healthy cells. It was a landmark product -- the first fully human monoclonal antibody approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- and spent years among the world's top-selling drugs.\n\nAbbVie's sales of Humira topped $21.2 billion in 2022 before it lost patent protection in 2023. Once patents expire, cheaper generic versions flood the market. Global Humira sales were $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, a 36% decline year over year. That's an annualized pace of $8.8 billion -- a significant drop from 2022 -- and it's likely to continue shrinking as Humira cedes market share.\n\nA winning sports team sustains success by developing young talent to replace aging stars. That's a good analogy for AbbVie, which must continually create new products to replace treatments whose patents expire.\n\nThe great news is that AbbVie has seemingly done that with its new immunology drugs Rinvoq and Skyrizi. These drugs have seen enough success that management has raised their long-term growth projections. Together, Rinvoq and Skyrizi may surpass Humira's best year by 2027:\n\nHumira created tremendous shoes to fill, but AbbVie may have done it. Analysts are calling for approximately $63.5 billion in revenue in 2025, the first time AbbVie would surpass $60 billion in sales. It looks like the business has shifted back into growth mode.\n\nDividends could slow, but growth prospects remain promising\n\nAs great as Rinvoq and Skyrizi should be, Humira's continued shrinkage will partially offset their growth. Investors who were hoping for huge dividend increases may want to adjust their expectations. Today, AbbVie's dividend payout ratio is 61% of 2024 earnings. That leaves plenty of room for future increases, but management may want to retain some financial flexibility. AbbVie is still carrying over $71 billion in long-term debt from an acquisition spree that included a $63 billion purchase of Allergan, $10.1 billion for ImmunoGen, and $8.7 billion for Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nThe company's ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is about 3.7. This is not a perilously high amount of leverage, but it's also not a situation where you want to tie up all your profits in dividend obligations. The dividend is significant to AbbVie: The company is a Dividend King, with a decades-long history of yearly increases from when it was still part of Abbott Labs.\n\nInvestors can probably expect mid- to high-single-digit dividend growth until the balance sheet is in better shape. Still, that's not so bad when you get a 3.6% starting yield.\n\nIs AbbVie a buy?\n\nThe business seems poised for long-term growth, and the dividend is solid (even if growth slows a bit). So is the stock worth buying today?\n\nAbbVie had a recent setback in November when it announced poor phase 2 study results for emraclidine. The once-promising drug was a potential blockbuster for treating schizophrenia, and was the primary motive for the $8.7 billion Cerevel Therapeutics deal. Analysts have revised their long-term growth estimates lower since November, but still believe AbbVie is capable of annualized long-term earnings growth of 8%.\n\nThe resulting decline in the share price has made the stock's valuation look a bit more attractive in my view. I'd argue that the current level is a fair price (perhaps a bit cheap) for a dividend stock of AbbVie's yield and growth outlook.\n\nThe bottom line? AbbVie's post-Humira prospects look far better than investors are giving it credit for. The dividend is rock-solid and should continue growing along with the share price over the coming years. That makes AbbVie a solid buy today.",

            "content": "The market expects AbbVie (ABBV) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $14.92 billion, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.63% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory Continues",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other halal dividend stocks.\n\nHalal stocks are shares in companies that adhere to Shariah law. These companies operate in accordance with Islamic principles, avoiding industries such as alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. They also maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their revenue sources are consistent with Islamic values. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah index tracks the performance of Shariah-compliant companies from the Composite 1500 that have a history of consistently raising their dividends for at least 20 years. These companies follow a managed dividend strategy, ensuring steady growth in dividend payouts.\n\nWhen investing in halal stocks, it's important for investors to carefully consider a company's balance sheet. Companies with debt exceeding 33% of their market value are disqualified from halal investing, though this ratio can fluctuate for some businesses. According to a World Bank report, the Islamic finance industry has grown quickly in the last decade, with an annual growth rate of 10-12%. Currently, Sharia-compliant financial assets are valued at approximately $2 trillion, encompassing both bank and non-bank institutions, as well as capital markets, money markets, and insurance.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nHalal investing is still a relatively new concept in the US, where Muslims make up around 1% of the population, as of 2020. In the past, older generations of Muslims typically focused on real estate and physical gold as investments or chose stocks recommended by friends and community members. The complexities of Islamic finance have led many to overlook it. However, this is beginning to change as technology advances and demographic trends shift. Financial educators, along with fintech startups, halal stockpickers, and specialized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are helping fill the gap. In addition, the rise of zero-fee brokerages has made investing more accessible to Muslims who follow strict financial guidelines. These low-cost platforms have made it easier to serve clients who were previously overlooked or considered unprofitable. Omar Shaikh, director of Islamic Finance Council UK, made the following comment about this:\n\n\u201cIslamic finance as a sector is barely 30 years old, with the past 15 years seeing the most development. It takes time to educate and create awareness and as this has happened, more banks have focused on servicing the demand for halal investing. This in turn helps to create more products, which then creates more demand.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other large-cap value stocks.\n\nWhy is this Portfolio Manager Cautiously Optimistic?\n\nThe market outlook is as uncertain as it gets. On January 18, Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, appeared in an interview on Wealth at Yahoo Finance to share his market outlook, which happens to be rather optimistic or \"cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nPavlik shared that as the new administration takes over he is optimistic about how the market will play out in the near future. He added that the new government is expected to do some deregulation and cut corporate taxes, which are supposedly going to boost earnings despite inflation being a concern. He also explained why he was cautious earlier. He stated that the easing cycle was more uncertain and the new government was emphasizing tariffs earlier, however, as time has passed, Pavlik has grown to become more optimistic about the market.\n\nHe also expects the economy to grow, suggesting that the US is nowhere near a recession. In addition to that, Pavlik is confident that valuations are expected to ease, tariffs seem to be a \"bargaining chip,\" and mass deportations are \"not going to happen.\" In addition to that, he believes new energy policies to lower the price of oil and gas, resulting in lower costs incurred by firms across nearly every industry.\n\nBy the middle of 2025, Pavlik expects the Fed to be back issuing multiple rate cuts. Overall, he expects 2025 to be a solid year for equities, with expectations of the S&P 500 reaching 6,750, representing a 13-14% growth from January 18, 2025. While he agrees that in the near term, especially in the first 100 days of the new government, there are reasons to be slightly cautious, he remains confident that the new policies will work out as the market goes forward.\n\nSpeaking of inflation, Pavlik reiterated that the new energy policies will definitely push oil companies to produce more oil as a result of cost reductions. These cost reductions are expected to have a multiplier effect on grocery companies which will ultimately cater to inflationary pressures, added the portfolio manager. This coupled with his expectation of the Fed returning to its planned easing cycle will likely fuel shared investor sentiment and consumer confidence.\n\nWhile the first 100 days of the new administration may be uncertain and volatile, there are some stocks known to have been stable through rough or smooth market conditions. That said, let's take a look at the 15 best large-cap value stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won\u2019t rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar\u2019s director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that\u2019s partially because of the relative underperformance that they\u2019ve had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they\u2019re becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\u201d\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management\u2019s confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 18.03%\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an Illinois-based biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development and commercialization of advanced therapies and treatments in various areas of healthcare. The company continues to be a key player in the pharmaceutical industry, supported by a strong portfolio of existing products and promising candidates in its pipeline. One standout is Tavapadon, a treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease, which recently achieved significant milestones in a late-stage study, offering hope for ABBV\u2019s neuroscience initiatives.\n\nAlthough pharmaceutical stocks have encountered difficulties in 2024, largely due to political concerns over drug pricing, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\u2019s focus on creating new, innovative treatments has positioned it strongly. The Inflation Reduction Act, which limits price increases, has pushed companies to prioritize innovation instead of relying on price hikes. The company\u2019s successful efforts to diversify its portfolio in recent years have positioned the company for substantial growth moving forward. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 5%.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) reported revenue of $14.46 billion, which saw a 4% increase from the same period last year. Its Immunology Portfolio generated over $7 billion, also growing by 4%. Moreover, in August 2024, AbbVie completed an $8.7 billion acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, a neuroscience company.\n\nWhile AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) primarily focuses on immunology, oncology, inflammation, and eye care, its recent move into neuroscience has opened up additional growth opportunities, helping to diversify its revenue streams. For investors, the key focus should be on AbbVie\u2019s robust pipeline in these other areas, which holds potential for future growth, regardless of how its neuroscience efforts unfold.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stocks with steady dividends as the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 52 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.64 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.79%, as of January 20.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2024, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), up from 67 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at roughly $2.6 billion. With over 1.7 million shares, AQR Capital Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall ABBV ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

As global populations age, the healthcare sector is set to experience significant growth, making it an attractive choice for investors.\n\nFor those looking to start with just $1,500, there are three standout healthcare stocks worth considering for long-term investment.\n\nAbbVie has expertly handled the challenges of patent expiration, particularly with its flagship drug Humira. As biosimilars began entering the market in 2023, AbbVie had already strategically positioned itself with promising new products, Rinvoq and Skyrizi. Now trading around $173, AbbVie not only offers strong growth prospects but also boasts a lucrative forward dividend yield of 3.8%, making it a great option for dividend investors.\n\nNext, Intuitive Surgical continues to lead in the robotic surgery market with its da Vinci system. With around 84% of its 2024 revenue stemming from recurring sales, the company is on a strong growth trajectory. Although the stock has a high forward earnings multiple at 76, its consistent double-digit growth in surgical procedures suggests the valuation is justifiable.\n\nLastly, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, trading close to $430, remains a pioneer in cystic fibrosis treatment, particularly after FDA approval of its new therapy, Alyftrek. The company\u2019s robust pipeline includes several potential blockbuster drugs in development, indicating promising future growth.\n\nInvesting in these healthcare stocks could lead to substantial long-term benefits as the industry evolves.\n\nBeyond Investment: The Broad Implications of Navigating the Healthcare Sector\n\nThe burgeoning healthcare sector, propelled by an aging global population and increasing emphasis on health innovation, is changing the fabric of society and culture. As people live longer and demand for healthcare services rises, investors play a crucial role in shaping the landscape, influencing everything from patient care to medical technology advancements. Companies like AbbVie, Intuitive Surgical, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals reflect a shift toward predictive and personalized medicine, with implications that extend beyond profit margins.\n\nMoreover, the economic impact is profound. The healthcare industry is projected to reach $10 trillion globally by 2022, demonstrating its significance as a cornerstone for economic stability and growth. Jobs in healthcare are among the fastest-growing, and the sector is likely to create millions of new positions, addressing labor shortages while shaping new workforce dynamics.\n\nHowever, with this growth comes potential environmental repercussions. The healthcare industry must confront its carbon footprint, striving for sustainability amidst increasing waste generation and resource consumption. Future trends indicate that eco-friendly practices will become vital, both for compliance and as a competitive advantage.\n\nIn the long run, the significance of healthcare investments reaches far beyond finance; they could determine the trajectories of innovation, quality of life, and even environmental stewardship as we navigate this complex ecosystem. Thus, investing in healthcare is not just about securing financial gains\u2014it\u2019s about participating in a transformative force that affects every corner of our society.\n\nUnlocking Investment Potential: Top Healthcare Stocks Staring from $1,500\n\nAs healthcare continues to expand in response to an aging global population, investors are increasingly drawn to opportunities within this dynamic sector. Here, we delve into three promising healthcare stocks to consider for investors looking to start with as little as $1,500. These stocks not only offer growth potential but also attractive features that could benefit long-term portfolios.\n\n1.

            "content": "In an ambitious initiative that could redefine the future of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) management, the INTERCEPT project has launched Europe\u2019s first trial focused on the early detection and prevention of this debilitating condition.\n\nThe 5-year, multimillion Euro initiative, backed by more than \u20ac38 million (nearly $40 million US) from the Innovative Health Initiative Joint Undertaking (IHI JU), is committed to transforming the incurable chronic illness to one that can be intercepted early and potentially prevented before symptoms manifest. The announcement was made January 22 by IHI JU.1\n\n\u00a9rookielion/stock.adobe.com\n\nThe focus of the INTERCEPT trial will be to verify and clinically validate a panel of investigational biomarkers and to create a blood risk score that can identify individuals at high risk for developing Crohn\u2019s disease before symptomatic onset, specifically within 5 years after an initial evaluation, according to the IHI statement.1\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease is one of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and affects approximately 3.1 million people in the US and the same number in Europe (CDC). Incidence is steadily rising among children and young adults, according to the US CDC.2 Characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, CD also increases the risk of complications, including colon cancer, delayed growth in pediatric patients, and mental health conditions, notably depression.2 Individuals with the disease experience unpredictable and alternating waves of remission and flare-ups. Despite advances in therapeutic interventions, nearly half of CD patients require surgery within a decade of diagnosis, and only 10% achieve long-term remission, according to IHI.1\n\nBiomarkers are successfully used to detect the early stages of diseases including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Preclinical candidate biomarkers have been identified for CD but have yet to be validated across diverse populations, the IHI stated.\n\n\u201cBiomarkers are key to future research and have the potential to revolutionise the treatment landscape for IBD,\u201d Awny Farajallah, MD, chief medical officer at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the industry lead for INTERCEPT, said in the statement.1\n\n\u201cWe have been able to design this project due to our colleagues in North America laying the scientific foundation of predictive biomarkers for Crohn\u2019s Disease,\" Geert D\u2019Haens, PhD, project coordinator from Stichting Amsterdam UMC, added. \"Although our field is somewhat behind type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, we are confident that we have strong and reliable biomarkers and very safe treatments to offer.\u201d1\n\nINTERCEPT will recruit 10,000 healthy first-degree relatives of CD patients from 7 European countries to further validate the identified biomarkers and the risk score. Of these participants, 80 individuals at the highest risk will participate in a prevention trial using an established and highly effective medical treatment aimed at halting disease progression.\n\n\u201cINTERCEPT is setting its sights on a future where Crohn\u2019s Disease is highly manageable or even avoidable,\u201d the announcement stated.1\n\nThe ambitious goal is being pursued through the collaborative efforts of 21 IHI partners from Europe, North America, and South Korea. \u201cIn intercepting Crohn\u2019s Disease, we face complex scientific challenges that no one organisation can address alone,\u201d Takeda\u2019s Farahallah elaborated. \u201cOur collaboration will unite public and private sector expertise and resources to more efficiently advance Crohn\u2019s research and potentially benefit IBD patients.\u201d1\n\nGlobal Impact Potential\n\nThis cross-continental partnership also highlights the global impact and broader implications of the project. \u201cFor the first time, researchers from multiple European countries, North America, and South Korea are working together to predict and prevent Crohn\u2019s disease. Our combined success could reinforce the concept that immune-mediated diseases\u2014affecting the gut, joints, skin, and brain\u2014can be prevented,\u201d Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Colombel, MD, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, commented.\n\n\u201cI am honored to lead the unique collaboration of bright scientists,\u201d project coordinator D\u2019Haens emphasized. \u201cIt really feels like this may lead to the most significant scientific progress in the field since the initial description of the disease by Burrill Crohn in 1932.\u201d\n\nThe INTERCEPT project officially kicks off on February 19, 2025, with a consortium meeting in Berlin, Germany.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

            "content": "A strong, resilient culture serves as a stabilising force that carries organisations through periods of disruption.\n\nThe corporate workplace model has undergone a transformation in recent years.\n\nOrganisations are continuing to redefine how teams interact and collaborate. In this evolving environment, the importance of workplace culture has grown exponentially.\n\nToday\u2019s workforce expects more than just stability and a paycheque \u2013 employees seek purpose, connection, inclusion, and above all, a sense of belonging.\n\nAs organisations navigate these complexities, it becomes clear that modern workplace culture demands a new approach \u2013 one that is human-centred, adaptive, and forward-looking.\n\nThis means that leaders are now challenged to adopt innovative strategies to build resilient, engaging, and inclusive workplace environments where employees can thrive holistically.\n\nAt the heart of this trend lie three pillars: leadership, employee engagement, and diversity and inclusion. These elements form the foundation of sustainable success in any organisation.\n\nLeadership that nurtures innovation and growth\n\nThe nature of leadership continues to evolve. Traditional top-down, authoritative, and transactional management does not resonate with the young generation.\n\nThe modern workforce calls for leaders who are empathetic, transparent, and human-centric.\n\nThe role of a leader today is not merely to direct but to inspire, guide, and foster trust within teams.\n\nOne of the most significant shifts in leadership is the emphasis on creating safe spaces for employees. This means building an environment where individuals feel psychologically safe to express their ideas, voice concerns, and challenge norms without fear of judgement or reproof. A safe workplace allows true innovation, collaboration, and growth.\n\nModern leadership requires three core qualities:\n\nEmpathy: Understanding and addressing the challenges employees face, both professionally and personally.\n\nTransparency: Communicating openly to build trust and eliminate ambiguity.\n\nFocus on Wellbeing: Prioritising the holistic well-being of employees by addressing their mental, emotional, and physical health.\n\nLeadership is no longer about holding power but about earning trust and credibility.\n\nA good leader recognises that every individual contributes uniquely to the team. When leaders genuinely listen, respect, and empower their people, they lay the foundation for a strong workplace culture.\n\nBy fostering trust, leaders can transform organisational culture into one where employees feel seen, heard, and valued \u2013 a necessity to retain top talent.\n\nEmpowering employees through purpose-driven engagement\n\nEmployees today are motivated by purpose \u2013 a clear connection between their work and its impact on society, customers, and their own professional development.\n\nPurpose-driven work based on meaningful employee engagement not only leads to higher levels of engagement but also improves productivity, retention, and morale.\n\nAs a pharmaceutical company, we at AbbVie are dedicated to making a difference in people\u2019s lives and empowering our employees to contribute to this impact.\n\nThrough our patient immersion programmes, we help employees connect with the purpose behind our work by engaging directly with the patients we aim to support. These interactions provide valuable insights into the health challenges they face and reinforce why our solutions matter.\n\nThroughout the year, we also organise purpose-driven employee engagement programmes, fostering a culture that aligns with our mission to discover and deliver innovative medicines and solutions that address complex health issues and enhance people's lives.\n\nPurpose-driven initiatives create opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and collective impact. At AbbVie Asia, programmes like our Week of Possibilities exemplify how purpose can drive engagement. These initiatives allow employees to step outside their day-to-day roles and contribute to meaningful change in their communities.\n\nDuring the Week of Possibilities, colleagues come together globally to advance health equity through community service in their respective countries, addressing social determinants of health such as access to nutritious food, safe housing, quality education, and economic challenges like poverty and unemployment.\n\nThe A+ Walk is another initiative that unites employees across Asia in a month-long walking challenge over a mobile platform. It helps employee participants stay healthy and supports patients in need and women empowerment by donating to charitable organisations when the participants achieve the target walk steps as one Asia team.\n\nThis initiative enables employees to make a tangible impact, build meaningful connections, and prioritise solutions while combining purpose-driven engagement and well-being.\n\nPurpose aligns employees\u2019 personal goals with organisational values, creating a workplace culture where everyone feels connected to something bigger than themselves.\n\nAt AbbVie, we engage employees to join the efforts to foster meaningful impact, both inside and outside the organisation. Employees who see purpose in their work are not just more engaged \u2013 they are more resilient, innovative, and committed to driving the organisation forward.\n\nInclusion and diversity: Key to a sustainable future\n\nTo successfully and effectively engage employees, the work environment must first foster inclusion, as it is essential for creating safe spaces where individuals feel valued and respected. Workplace inclusivity has evolved significantly over the years.\n\nWhile diversity and inclusion have long been priorities, organisations are now expanding their efforts to achieve representation at all levels, particularly in leadership.\n\nInclusive workplaces prioritise more than just hiring talent from different backgrounds \u2013 they cultivate psychologically safe environments where every employee feels secure to voice their perspectives, and empowered to thrive.\n\nAt the heart of it, leadership, employee engagement, and inclusivity go hand in hand, building the foundation for a truly successful organisation.\n\nInclusion plays a key role in driving innovation. When teams are composed of individuals from varied backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, they are better equipped to solve complex problems and challenge conventional thinking.\n\nInclusion, however, is what transforms diversity into impact. True inclusivity requires intentional strategies, such as mentorship programmes, leadership development, and creating platforms where all voices are heard.\n\nAt AbbVie, the commitment to diversity and inclusion is foundational and seen in our principles. This commitment guides AbbVie\u2019s efforts to build a culture where every employee feels like they belong.\n\nInclusion goes beyond representation \u2013 it\u2019s about fostering an environment where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to contribute, united by a strong sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nFor instance, through AbbVie\u2019s Ladies UNited in Asia (LUNA) initiatives, we bring equity, equality, diversity and inclusion to life by fostering psychological safety and empowering women across careers and cultures.\n\nThis happens through career empowerment talks, Pride celebrations, and Mother\u2019s Day events. By investing in such inclusive workplace initiatives, organisations can unlock the full potential of their teams and pave the way for innovation, equity, and long-term success.\n\nBuilding a resilient workplace culture\n\nAs organisations look ahead, resilience will be the defining characteristic of successful workplace cultures. Resilience is not just about weathering storms \u2013 it is about creating a culture where employees thrive, innovate, and drive the organisation forward, even during change.\n\nIn today\u2019s landscape, businesses face constant disruptions \u2013 economic downturns, technological advancements, and shifting workforce expectations. Building a resilient culture means cultivating adaptability.\n\nOrganisations must empower their employees to navigate change, embrace uncertainty, and innovate in the face of challenges. A strong, resilient culture serves as a stabilising force that carries the organisation through periods of disruption.\n\nLeadership, empowerment, and inclusion serve as the pillars of resilience.\n\nLeaders who prioritise employee well-being and engagement foster trust, adaptability, and loyalty.\n\nEmpowered employees, driven by purpose, remain committed to their roles even during turbulent times. Inclusive cultures, where every voice is valued, create strong teams that collaborate effectively to overcome challenges.\n\nAs we navigate an ever-changing environment, organisations have a responsibility to reflect on their cultures. Are leaders creating safe spaces? Are employees empowered by purpose? Are diversity and inclusion more than just buzzwords? By addressing these questions, organisations can shape cultures that drive long-term success, employee satisfaction, and societal impact.\n\nThe future of work is now, and it\u2019s ours to shape.",

Meanwhile, Abbvie will receive royalties on any sales of the experimental therapy within Greater China.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to partnering with Simcere Zaiming, to advance this novel trispecific antibody, which has the potential to help address significant unmet medical needs for people living with multiple myeloma,\u201d Stirner said.\n\nMyeloma is a blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells, a type of immune cell. It\u2019s often called multiple myeloma, since the cancer typically grows in multiple areas of the bone marrow.\n\nMyeloma treatment binds to 3 targets\n\nSIM0500 is an antibody-based therapy designed to kill myeloma cells by simultaneously binding to three distinct molecular targets. The therapy targets two proteins that are expressed on the surface of myeloma cells: BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) and GPRC5D (G-Protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D). At the same time, SIM0500 binds to CD3, a protein that\u2019s expressed by T-cells, which are a type of immune cell that\u2019s able to kill cancer cells.\n\nBy simultaneously sticking to targets on cancer cells and T-cells, the experimental therapy aims to trigger T-cells to destroy the myeloma cells.\n\n\u201cSIM0500 is developed via Simcere Zaiming\u2019s proprietary T-cell engager platform,\u201d said Renhong Tang, PhD, CEO of Simcere. \u201cWe are excited to partner with AbbVie on this novel drug candidate and look forward to working together to advance the clinical development of SIM0500.\u201d\n\nA Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06375044) is testing SIM0500 in people with hard-to-treat multiple myeloma. The study is open to adults with myeloma that has failed to be adequately controlled with all established standard-of-care therapies. All participants will be treated with SIM0500 for about a month, with the main aim of evaluating the therapy\u2019s safety profile.\n\nThe Phase 1 study is expected to enroll about 130 participants. Recruitment is ongoing at sites in the U.S. and in China.",

            "content": "Many products sold by companies aren't must-have items. However, healthcare is a necessity. And the healthcare sector is poised to grow over the next decade and beyond with aging populations around the world.\n\nThese factors make healthcare stocks a great addition to investors' portfolios. You won't need a huge amount of cash to get started investing, either. If you have only $1,500 to invest, here are three healthcare stocks to buy and hold forever (listed alphabetically).\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nSooner or later, every successful drugmaker will face a \"patent cliff.\" Drugs that raked in a lot of money in the past will lose their patent exclusivity and face competition from biosimilars or generics. To remain successful, drugmakers must have newer products ready to pick up the slack from the older ones. AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) could be the poster child for how to effectively navigate a patent cliff.\n\nWhen Abbott Labs spun off AbbVie in 2013, Humira was the new company's cash cow. The autoimmune disease drug ranked as the world's top-selling medication for years. AbbVie used nearly every trick in the book to extend Humira's reign, but it knew the day would eventually come when biosimilars would enter the market. That day came in the U.S. in 2023.\n\nHowever, AbbVie was well prepared. The company had invested in research and development. It made smart acquisitions. By the time Humira lost patent protection, AbbVie had significantly reduced its dependence on the drug. It also already had two successors with fast-growing sales on the market: Rinvoq and Skyrizi.\n\nAbbVie has proven its ability to survive and thrive in the face of challenges. You can pick up a share of the big biopharmaceutical company for around $173. That investment will begin to pay off almost immediately, too. AbbVie offers a forward dividend yield of 3.8%. The drugmaker is a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of dividend increases (including its time as part of Abbott).\n\n2. Intuitive Surgical\n\nConsider taking another $600 or so of your initial $1,500 to buy a share of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -2.44%). The company launched its da Vinci robotic surgical system in 2000 and continues to dominate the robotic surgical market.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is a perfect modern example of the razor-and-blades business model. In 2024, 84% of the company's total revenue was recurring -- in large part from replacement instruments for its da Vinci systems. This percentage of recurring revenue is growing, by the way. In 2017, it was 71%.\n\nI'd be leery about buying most stocks that trade at a forward earnings multiple of 76, as Intuitive Surgical does. However, I think a premium valuation is warranted in this case. Intuitive continues to grow its installed base and procedure volumes by double-digit percentages. More importantly, its growth prospects are huge.\n\nAround 2.78 million procedures were performed using Intuitive Surgical's robotic surgical systems last year. That's less than 35% of the procedures performed each year for which the company already has products and clearances. Intuitive estimates its products and clearances under development will enable it to target roughly 22 million soft tissue procedures performed annually.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nAfter buying one share each of AbbVie and Intuitive Surgical, you'd have more than enough left to scoop up a share of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.81%). The big biotech stock currently trades at around $430.\n\nWhy buy and hold Vertex stock forever? A quick look at the company's product lineup and pipeline can easily answer the question.\n\nVertex commands a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disorder. That monopoly is now arguably stronger than ever with the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Alyftrek, the company's most powerful CF therapy yet.\n\nAnother product, gene-editing therapy Casgevy, is still in the early stages of its commercial launch. Vertex also awaits the imminent FDA approval decision for suzetrigine, a non-opioid drug for treating acute pain.\n\nSeveral other potential blockbuster drugs could be on the way. Vertex's late-stage pipeline includes four programs. The biotech company is evaluating suzetrigine in treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It has two late-stage therapies targeting kidney diseases: inaxaplin for treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease and povetacicept for treating IgA nephropathy. Vertex even has a potential cure for severe type 1 diabetes in pivotal development with zimislecel.\n\nWhat I like most about Vertex is that it has demonstrated an ability to leverage success in one area (CF) to expand into other areas. I expect the company will continue to do this in the future, making a lot of money for investors along the way.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"United States Anesthesia Drugs Market by Type by General Inhalation by General Intravenous by Local, and Company Analysis 2025 to 2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe United States anesthesia drugs market is expected to reach from US$ 2.61 billion in 2024 to US$ 3.67 billion in 2033 with a compound annual growth rate of 3.86% from 2025 to 2033. More surgeries, development in technologies of anesthesia, and enhanced safety and comfort for the patient are factors behind such a growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnesthesia drugs are also commonly used in various settings within the United States' healthcare systems. These settings include hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, dental offices, and many more. Their applications include surgery, diagnostic procedures, labor and delivery, and pain management. Drugs include propofol, sevoflurane, and lidocaine; the type of anesthesia depends upon the drugs. In the US, with advanced medical technologies, there is emphasis given to the safety, efficacy, and recovery time that go along with the drugs during anesthesia.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Surgical Procedure\n\n\n\nThe high rate of surgical procedures in the U.S. contributes significantly to the growth of the anesthesia drugs market. In the United States, every year, about 15 million people undergo surgery. These include an increase in surgeries that are elective or emergency-type surgeries, especially orthopedic, cardiovascular, or cosmetic surgeries, which occur due to a growing proportion of older-aged populations, thus raising a demand in anesthesia drugs to maintain painlessness and safety among patients receiving such procedures.\n\nAdditionally, sedation anesthesia-based minimally invasive surgeries are increasingly being performed, thus increasing the demand for specialized drugs in anesthesia. For example, in September 2023, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons reported that 26.2 million surgical procedures are available in the U.S.\n\n\n\nAnesthesia Drug Formulations Development\n\n\n\nThe growth of the market is also driven by the development of anesthesia drug formulations. Healthcare providers increasingly prefer new and improved anesthesia agents that provide faster recovery times, fewer side effects, and better patient outcomes. Drugs such as propofol and sevoflurane have gained popularity due to their efficiency and safety profiles.\n\nAdditionally, innovations in local anesthetics for targeted pain management are expanding their use in outpatient surgeries and procedures. These advancements lead to greater demand for modern anesthesia drugs for better patient experiences and clinical results. For example, on April 2024, Baxter launched Ropivacaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP, extending its pharmaceutical portfolio in the U.S. This prefilled, single-dose infusion bag is indicated for administration of local or regional anesthesia during surgery and for relief of acute pain in adults, thereby improving product line and competitive position.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Emphasis on Patient Safety and Comfort\n\n\n\nAs patient safety and comfort become more prioritized in medical care, the demand for safer and more effective anesthesia drugs is increasing. Healthcare providers focus on minimizing adverse effects such as postoperative nausea, dizziness, and prolonged recovery times. Anesthesia drugs that offer better control over anesthesia depth, faster onset, and quicker recovery are highly sought. Patient-centered care initiatives in the U.S. have been pushing for individualized anesthesia approaches, hence the development and adoption of drugs that would provide optimal safety while ensuring patient comfort during and after procedures.\n\n\n\nGovernment Policy\n\n\n\nGovernment initiatives and health reforms play a significant role in defining the U.S. market for general anesthesia drugs. A great deal of investments from the federal government has been into health infrastructure and funding surgical procedures, which increased demand for anesthesia. Various types of surgical procedures covered by Medicare and Medicaid increase surgeries that require general anesthesia and subsequently increase the demand for the general anesthesia drugs.\n\n\n\nThis area of research emphasizes improving surgery outcome and patient safety, stimulating advanced anesthesia techniques and pharmaceutical products. The current innovations relate to the creation of safe, innovative, and user-friendly anesthetic delivery devices and agents. Modern anesthesia drugs provide a better-controlled effect duration and depth to assure quick recovery time and maximal safety for the patient.\n\n\n\nHealthcare reforms, government initiatives, and technological advancements are all crucial for the growth of the general anesthesia drugs market in the United States. Ongoing concern for patient safety and surgery effectiveness promotes the adoption of the latest drugs and anesthesia practices.\n\n\n\nRegulatory bodies, especially the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly anesthetics. The FDA's rigorous approval process ensures that only safe and effective anesthetic drugs are available. These regulatory guidelines influence various aspects of drug development, including labeling, dosage recommendations, and clinical trial requirements, all essential for the responsible application of anesthetic agents.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 120 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $2.61 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $3.67 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 3.8% Regions Covered United States\n\n\n\nCompany Analysis:\n\nBaxter International Inc\n\nAbbvie\n\nMedtronic Plc\n\nDraegerwerk AG\n\nKoninklijke Philips NV\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

In addition, the regulator greenlit Calquence\u2019s use as a part of a first-line combo treatment in MCL patients who are ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe news came the day before the drug was listed among 14 others as being subject to Medicare price negotatiations this year under the Inflation Reduction Act. According to a factsheet from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Calquence cost the Medicare Part D program $1.6 billion between November 2023 and October 2024 as some 15,000 Medicare beneficiaries took the drug. AstraZeneca has until Feb. 28 to agree to participate in the negotiations.\n\nCalquence is the first BTK inhibitor approved as part of a first-line treatment for MCL, beating out a handful of other companies all pushing through similar molecules through clinical trials. BeiGene and partners Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie were all looking to push their own BTK inhibitors for MCL into the first-line setting. J&J and AbbVie\u2019s Imbruvica was rejected for first-line status in 2022, and in April 2023, the companies said they would withdraw the drug from the market for second-line settings. Meanwhile, BeiGene\u2019s Brukinsa, already approved as a second-line drug for MCL, is currently in Phase III trials for first-line status.\n\nCalquence\u2019s approval was based on a Phase III trial this past summer showing a 27% benefit over placebo on progression-free survival. Data on overall survival for Calquence have not been shown. AstraZeneca noted that when correcting for deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit increased to 36%.\n\nMantle-cell lymphoma is a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. BTK inhibitors are a relatively uncommon mechanism for cancer drugs. The only other BTK inhibitor on the market is Eli Lilly\u2019s Jaypirca, also used to treat MCL as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With the close of J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, attention turns to next week\u2019s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, and what his administration might mean for the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBy and large, pharma executives and investors here are largely saying they remain confident in the stability of regulatory processes, despite headlines around the potential for disruption. Some aren\u2019t expecting much to change if Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou might politically look at some of his views in question, but scientifically, people believe that he's quite strong when he drives and makes decisions based on rational inputs,\u201d said Andy Plump, president of R&D at Takeda Pharmaceuticals.\n\nEven if Makary or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump\u2019s named to lead HHS, were to place new scrutiny on the approval of vaccines or other drugs, there are checks in the overall system, said Chris Bardon, co-managing partner of life science investment firm MPM BioImpact.\n\n\"In most situations, political appointees don't really change much,\u201d Bardon said. \u201cThe people who are just doing their job every day, processing applications, reviewing data, working with companies? None of that's going to change.\u201d\n\nYet the FDA will be without a number of veteran leaders, including Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus and Patrizia Cavazzoni, who have stepped down or announced plans to depart since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nExpect more details on Trump\u2019s healthcare agenda in the coming weeks as the Senate vets both Kennedy and Makary. In the meantime, here are few other highlights from BioPharma Dive\u2019s time covering the JPM meeting.\n\nWhere are the generalists?\n\nBiotech\u2019s winter could last well past the changing of the seasons this year, if you ask analysts at HSBC Innovation Banking. Though some in the industry are optimistic, others, HSBC among them, see headwinds from interest rates and the potential for regulatory instability from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Uncertainty always creates volatility, and volatility is not great for the public markets,\u201d said Rebecca Stevenson, head of healthcare investment banking in the Americas for HSBC. \u201cUltimately the dust needs to settle before we see generalist [investors] back in. Is that happening in the next six months? Probably not.\"\n\nAnalysts have pointed to the retreat of generalist investors, who park their funds across sectors, from biotech public offerings as one reason for depressed IPO performance.\n\n\"The only thing you could chase during the pandemic was healthcare so they're all overindexed on healthcare,\" Stevenson said. \"They\u2019ve got to get those positions down.\u201d\n\nFor many to come back in, dealmaking needs to pick up and remain high. While HSBC views the pace of private market M&A as \u201csolid,\u201d deals for public companies were noticeably less last year. (J&J offered some respite on the latter front Monday, bidding nearly $15 billion to buy Intra-Cellular Therapies.)\n\nTwo factors have been at play, Stevenson said: Large-cap consolidation has seemed off the table under the Biden administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission, but also, there are relatively few assets with the commercial impact and revenue pharma companies look for to justify major deals.\n\nInvestors are also keeping an eye on geopolitical tensions, such as competition between the U.S. and China, and guidance on upcoming interest rate cuts. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nExplaining Lilly\u2019s missed forecast\n\nEli Lilly disappointed investors hours before CEO David Ricks\u2019 appearance at JPM, when it announced 2024 revenue that fell short of the financial guidance it gave Wall Street only months ago. Speaking to many of those investors Tuesday afternoon, Ricks outlined some of the reasons why.\n\nPrescription growth for many chronic diseases is higher in December than in most other months, so Lilly assumed that would be the case with its GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, which didn\u2019t come true, Ricks said. That might have been because of how insurers handle new prescriptions, but the company doesn\u2019t exactly know why. \u201cNonetheless, it happened, and we didn't predict it,\u201d he said.\n\nUnpredictable decisions by distributors and wholesalers on how much supply to stock also played a role, he said. \u201cThe economics in our distribution channels aren't great right now, and they're really preserving their working capital,\u201d Ricks said.\n\nThose mistakes have helped Lilly better understand GLP-1 market dynamics, particularly in the relatively new obesity indication where Zepbound is prescribed.\n\n\u201cIt's our job to give good guidance to the street, and we aim to land within that guidance normally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I think we're dealing with a business here that is pretty unprecedented in our sector in terms of size and scale and growth rate, and we've learned a few things.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAbbVie reassessing psychiatry\n\nAbbVie\u2019s $8.7 billion purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics last year was a big bet om emraclidine, an experimental drug for schizophrenia designed in similar fashion to another Bristol Myers Squibb had acquired by buying Karuna Therapeutics.\n\nWhile Karuna\u2019s drug is now approved in the U.S. as Cobenfy, Cerevel\u2019s unexpectedly fell short in two Phase 2 trials last November. The failure cost AbbVie billions of dollars in market value and left analysts stunned. Last week, AbbVie took a roughly $3.5 billion impairment charge to reflect the setback\u2019s impact on its books.\n\nThe drug hasn\u2019t been completely cast aside, AbbVie executives told investors at the JPM Wednesday. \u201cWe're still studying it,\u201d said CEO Robert Michael. \u201cWe still think emraclidine can play a role.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company appears to be rethinking the investment it commits to neuropsychiatry more broadly.\n\n\u201cCommitting that much capital on early data, we'd certainly rethink that in psych,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThat said, we weren't the only party that was bidding for Cerevel. They saw the same thing we did.\u201d\n\nBut AbbVie remains willing to take \u201ccalculated risks,\u201d Michael added, citing the company\u2019s track record in adding important assets like Skyrizi and Imbruvica through dealmaking. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nNovartis\u2019 dealmaking plans\n\nNovartis spent billions of dollars snapping up companies in 2023 and 2024, from radiopharmaceutical developer Mariana Oncology to Kate Therapeutics and its experimental gene therapies. The company will remain an active dealmaker in 2025, according to Fiona Marshall, Novartis\u2019 president of biomedical research.\n\nIn an interview with BioPharma Dive Tuesday, Marshall said the pharmaceutical company is open to bringing in a variety of early-stage assets, even if its own R&D teams are developing their own versions or working on similar technology. It picked up Mariana, which had a radiopharma drug in development for small cell lung cancer, expanding a pipeline that already contained the radiopharma therapies Pluvicto and Lutathera.\n\n\u201cSo often, it's having our own program that makes us really like the project, and then if we see somebody else is doing it better than us externally, we'll still bring that in,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite cooling interest in gene therapy due to persistent challenges, Novartis is still bullish on the field and on assets it acquired via deals for Kate as well as for DTx Pharma in 2023. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nBen Fidler contributed reporting.",

            "content": "With explosive deals out of the way, news from the third day of the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference slowed down quite a bit. Still, Conference saw even more pharma powerhouses lay out their business strategies for 2025 and beyond.\n\nAbbVie Leans on I&I in Aftermath of Schizophrenia Stumble\n\nDespite the stunning mid-stage failure of its antipsychotic drug candidate emraclidine in schizophrenia, AbbVie at an investor conference on Wednesday doubled down on its goal of hitting mid-single-digit topline and earnings-per-share growth in 2025, according to a note from Guggenheim Partners. The pharma expects its sales growth to be in the high single-digit range through 2030.\n\nTo hit this target, AbbVie will need to rely on its primary domain of expertise, inflammation and immunology. According to a note from BMO Capital Markets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will \u201ccontinue their robust growth in 2025,\u201d with the pharma being \u201cclearly confident\u201d in the therapies\u2019 market performance.\n\nIn addition, Humira erosion will likely be \u201clower on an absolute basis\u201d than 2024 levels, BMO analysts wrote. Growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq will likely \u201cgrow past the [loss of exclusivity] concerns,\u201d particularly with upcoming trials and regulatory decisions for Rinvoq in lupus, alopecia areata and hidradenitis suppurativa.\n\nNot all hope is lost in the neuropsychiatry space, however. While CEO Robert Michael said during the conference that the pharma will \u201ccommit less capital\u201d to developing psychiatric therapies, according to Reuters, the BMO note indicates that AbbVie still \u201cexpects emraclidine opportunity to remain.\u201d The company is planning to test higher doses of the drug.\n\nGilead Fends Off Criticism for Lenacapavir Access Program\n\nSpeaking to the media on Wednesday, Gilead CEO Dan O\u2019Day stood by the company\u2019s proposed accessibility program for its HIV pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) lenacapavir, according to STAT News.\n\nGilead in October 2024 announced that it had entered into a deal with generics developers to provide a low-cost version of lenacapavir in more than 100 resource-strapped countries\u2014mostly lower- and lower-to middle-income nations\u2014where the incidence of HIV is high. Critics, however, have pointed out that upper-middle-income countries also struggle to control high HIV case counts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really focused on sustainable models that fit\u201d the needs of a country\u2019s healthcare system, as well as the \u201ceconomic situation\u201d of these countries, O\u2019Day said, as per STAT\u2019s reporting. \u201cWe\u2019ve done tiered pricing before. It is a sustainable way to make sure that countries get medicines for people in the countries that need it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Gilead released data for the long-acting formulation of lenacapavir. Readouts from the Phase III PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 studies showed that at a twice-yearly dosing regimen, long-acting lenacapavir can reduce HIV infections by at least 96%, with an efficacy estimate that reaches up to 100%.\n\nDyne Plots Path for Rare Muscle Disease Candidate\n\nDyne Therapeutics also provided an encouraging program update at JPM25 on Wednesday, giving what Jefferies analysts call a \u201cbar for success\u201d that \u201cseems favorable\u201d for its myotonic dystrophy type 1 candidate DYNE-101.\n\nDyne is planning to start a registrational study for DYNE-101, testing a 6.8-mg/kg dose of the investigational antisense oligonucleotide every 8 weeks. According to the Jefferies note, DYNE-101\u2019s Phase I/II efficacy is within striking distance of the efficacy threshold that the pivotal trial will target, giving Dyne \u201ccushion to succeed\u201d by the first half of 2026. An approval is expected by early 2027.\n\nJefferies projects a peak opportunity of at least $3 billion for DYNE-101. Dyne is also running another candidate\u2014the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer DYNE-251 being tested for Duchenne muscular dystrophy\u2014which has an earnings opportunity of $300 million to $500 million. Both assets are poised to enter registrational studies under accelerated approval pathways, according to Jefferies.\n\nGSK to Stay Out of Obesity\u2014but not GLP-1s\n\nAt JPM25 on Monday, GSK Chief Scientific Officer Tony Wood said that the pharma has no interest in joining the weight-loss frenzy\u2014but GLP-1 therapies aren\u2019t off the table, according a Wednesday report from Fierce Biotech.\n\nThe obesity space is already \u201cvery crowded,\u201d Wood told Fierce in an interview, additionally pointing out that the treatments on the market and those in development are \u201cenormously exciting.\u201d Instead, GSK will focus its efforts on related conditions and the risks that remain \u201cafter you\u2019ve dealt with the problems of weight reduction.\u201d\n\nThe pharma is also looking for opportunities to leverage the clinical profile of the GLP-1 class beyond obesity. Several recent studies have elucidated the benefits of GLP-1 therapies outside of weight loss, pointing to potential areas of expansion.\n\nGSK opened JPM25 with a $1.1 billion acquisition of IDRx and its lead asset IDRX-42, a small molecule drug candidate for gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

(ABBV) focuses on creating medicines and solutions that address complex health issues and enhance people's lives through its core therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, eye care, aesthetics and more. With a market cap of $310.2 billion, AbbVie operates as one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\nThe pharma giant is gearing up to announce its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Friday, Jan. 31. Ahead of the event, analysts expect AbbVie to report a non-GAAP profit of $2.10 per share, down 24.7% from $2.79 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed Wall Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters. Its adjusted EPS for the last reported quarter grew 1.7% year-over-year to $3.00, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 2.7%.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2024, AbbVie is expected to deliver an adjusted EPS of $10.06, down 9.5% from $11.11 in fiscal 2023. While in fiscal 2025, its earnings are expected to rebound 21.6% year-over-year to $12.23 per share.\n\nABBV stock has gained 5.5% over the past 52-week period, outpacing the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLV) marginal gains but underperforming the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 24.4% surge during the same time frame.\n\nAbbVie stock price soared 6.4% after the release of its better-than-expected Q3 results on Oct. 30. Driven by notable gains in its immunology, oncology, and neuroscience portfolios, the company reported a 3.8% year-over-year growth in net revenues to $14.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Meanwhile, due to a staggering 35.1% decrease in COGS, its operating profits surged nearly 68% year-over-year to $3.8 billion. Observing its business momentum, AbbVie raised its earnings guidance, boosting investor confidence.\n\nOn Nov. 11, ABBV stock plunged 12.6% after emraclidine, an experimental schizophrenia drug it acquired last year for $8.7 billion, failed two mid-stage studies. This event wiped out nearly $40 billion of AbbVie\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nNonetheless, analysts remain bullish about the stock\u2019s long-term prospects. ABBV has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of the 27 analysts covering the stock, 17 suggest \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two advise \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and eight recommend \u201cHold\u201d rating. The mean price target of $205.41 indicates a 19.9% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to jump 8.1% in fiscal 2025. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Consumer spending growth is also drying up. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+11.7% vs. -2.2%). The company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The drugs are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. AbbVie has been on an acquisition spree lately in its core space of immunology.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is facing turbulence after its experimental schizophrenia drug, emraclidine, flopped in two mid-stage trials. The drug, picked up in AbbVie's $8.7 billion acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, failed to ease symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, leading the company to book a staggering $3.5 billion charge. Speaking at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, CEO Robert Michael admitted that psychiatry is a challenging area, adding that AbbVie plans to dial back its spending on psychiatric drugs while still taking calculated risks. Meanwhile, AbbVie is trying to catch up to Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and its newly approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, which promises fewer side effects than older treatments.\n\nOn the financial front, AbbVie has trimmed its 2024 adjusted profit forecast to $10.02$10.06 per share, down from its earlier projection of $10.90$10.94. Analysts were hoping for $10.94, so this is definitely a miss. The downgrade is partly due to $1.6 billion in acquisition-related expenses and R&D costs, as the company aggressively expands its pipeline to replace revenues lost after its arthritis superstar, Humira, lost patent protection. AbbVie spent over $20 billion last year snapping up neuroscience-focused Cerevel, cancer innovator ImmunoGen, and Alzheimer's therapy developer Aliada. Still, with fourth-quarter adjusted profit expected to dip to $2.06$2.10 per share, down from $2.79 a year ago, AbbVie's bold bets are taking a toll.\n\nSo, what's next? AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings report on January 31 will be the moment of truth. Investors will be watching closely to see how these high-stakes acquisitions pan out and whether the pipeline can start delivering results. For now, AbbVie is walking a tightropenavigating setbacks while doubling down on its vision to stay competitive in a fiercely innovative market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Investors in AbbVie Inc (Symbol: ABBV) saw new options become available today, for the April 17th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 92 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ABBV options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $163.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ABBV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $172.35/share today.\n\nBecause the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.88% return on the cash commitment, or 15.41% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for AbbVie Inc, and highlighting in green where the $170.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of ABBV stock at the current price level of $172.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $175.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.74% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ABBV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for AbbVie Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ABBV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $175.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.21% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.70% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 25%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $172.35) to be 24%.

The drug manufacturer stock is on sale for several reasons.\n\n\n\nAbbVie terminated its Alector collaboration agreement on Jan. 10. This will result in an impairment charge of $3.5 billion. In November, the company disclosed that two Phase 2 studies did not meet their primary endpoint. Emraclidine was a drug candidate for treating schizophrenia.\n\nThe letdown is good news for Bristol-Myers (BMY) Cobenfy, an oral pill for treating schizophrenia, is now even more important.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter, AbbVie issued a weaker forecast. It now expects acquired IPR&D and milestone expenses of $1.6 billion. This cuts its earnings per share by $0.88. For 2024, the company will post an EPS of $10.02 to $10.06.\n\n\n\nThe bad news added uncertainty to the company. However, ABBV stock has a good chance of returning to $200. The stock pays an attractive dividend that yields around 3.5%. Expect the firm to grow its revenue from its extensive drug pipeline. The firm is prudently managing its research and development costs.\n\n\n\nAbbVie has a good record of monetizing its R&D efforts. It will post positive results from collaborations. As it establishes licensing agreements, the firm will report more consistent earnings.\n\n",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best dividend king stocks to invest in now.\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks has been a focal point for investors for several years. The attractive income generated from these stocks motivates many to invest. Among these, dividend growth stocks stand out, as they offer the potential for increasing income over time, which is highly appealing. In the US, numerous companies have consistently raised their dividends for over five decades, earning them the prestigious title of Dividend Kings.\n\nAnalysts have long supported dividend stocks due to their historically robust performance. Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, has highlighted several reasons to consider investing in these stocks. She pointed out that the income generated by dividend stocks can assist investors in meeting their liquidity needs. In addition, dividend-focused investments have shown a tendency to reduce volatility and mitigate losses during market downturns. Cabacungan particularly emphasizes the value of dividend growth stocks in this context. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind the broader market, but their future remains promising. Analysts are optimistic about a rebound, as cash flow remains a key priority for investors. Capital Group has advised looking for opportunities in overlooked dividend-paying companies, such as pharmaceutical firms overshadowed by the focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and select banks. In addition, dividend growth stocks with substantial yields continue to attract interest. Companies offering dividends alongside strong balance sheets and appealing yields can deliver steady income, cushion against market downturns, and foster solid investment growth. A report from ProShares noted that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For example, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to more than $61,000 by March 2023.\n\nAlso read: 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nInvestor preferences have led many US companies to increase and sustain their dividends in 2024. Financial experts anticipate continued dividend growth in 2025. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, predicts an average dividend increase of around 8% for the current year. He expects another record payout in 2025, estimated at approximately $685 billion, compared to the projected $630 billion for 2024. Silverblatt attributes this growth to record earnings, anticipated future earnings, declining interest rates, strong employment, and overall economic growth.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "AbbVie (ABBV) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which AbbVie falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAbbVie is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -2.6%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.23 indicates a change of +13% from what AbbVie is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for AbbVie.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Dividend growth investing is a powerful strategy for building lasting wealth. Companies that consistently raise their dividends tend to possess durable competitive advantages, robust cash flows, and shareholder-friendly management teams.\n\nThese characteristics make dividend growth stocks compelling investments in any market environment. The strategy's success stems from the financial discipline and steady execution these companies demonstrate, making them ideal portfolio cornerstones for investors seeking both rising income and capital appreciation.\n\nHere are two exceptional dividend growers that deserve your attention.\n\nA payments processing giant\n\nVisa (V -0.56%) operates the world's largest electronic payments network, processing billions of transactions annually. The company's vast scale and global footprint create significant competitive advantages in the digital payments industry.\n\nThe payment processor's network effects create a powerful competitive moat through a self-reinforcing business model. More cardholders attract more merchants to the network, which in turn draws more cardholders. This dynamic helps explain Visa's industry-leading profit margins and consistent earnings growth.\n\nVisa's market dominance extends beyond traditional credit card payments. The company continues to invest heavily in digital payment technologies and cybersecurity infrastructure, strengthening Visa's competitive position as consumer payment preferences evolve toward digital and mobile solutions.\n\nWhile Visa's 0.77% dividend yield might appear modest, the company has increased its payout by 15.4% annually over the past five years. The payment giant maintains a conservative 21.4% payout ratio, leaving substantial room to boost dividends as earnings grow.\n\nThe stock trades at 27.4 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 23.4 multiple. This moderate premium appears justified given Visa's global payments leadership and demonstrated commitment to growing shareholder payouts.\n\nA pharmaceutical powerhouse\n\nAbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) has built a diverse portfolio of medicines anchored in immunology and oncology. The company's current growth drivers include blockbuster drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which help offset declining sales from its former top seller Humira.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant's competitive edge stems from substantial investments in research and development. AbbVie's robust product pipeline and expansion into emerging markets position the company for sustained growth. These strengths have proven particularly valuable as the company navigates Humira's loss of exclusivity.\n\nAbbVie's immunology franchise continues to expand well beyond Humira. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have captured significant market share across multiple therapeutic areas over the past two years, pointing to robust growth ahead. The company's growing presence in oncology adds another powerful revenue stream, benefiting from the strong pricing power pharmaceutical companies typically command in cancer therapies.\n\nAbbVie rewards shareholders with an attractive 3.74% dividend yield and has grown its payout by 7.69% annually over the past five years. The company's 213% payout ratio might raise eyebrows, but dividend-paying pharmaceutical companies average 141% due to their unique product development cycles.\n\nThe stock trades at 14.6 times forward earnings, a significant discount to the S&P 500's 23.4 multiple. This attractive valuation, combined with AbbVie's robust product portfolio and commitment to dividend growth, offers investors compelling value in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nBuilding wealth through rising dividends\n\nDividend growth stocks often reward investors in different ways. Visa embodies the low-yield, high-growth approach through its dominant payment network and conservative payout ratio. AbbVie offers a higher-yield strategy backed by its robust pharmaceutical pipeline, proven capital allocation strategy, and commitment to rewarding loyal shareholders via ever-increasing dividend payments.\n\nDespite their different approaches toward value creation, both companies showcase how powerful competitive advantages drive sustainable dividend growth. Visa's payment network and AbbVie's therapeutic leadership create durable economic moats, supporting rising shareholder payouts through the full complement of market cycles.\n\nTherefore, these industry leaders deserve strong consideration at their current valuations among investors prioritizing long-term wealth creation.",

(Nasdaq: RGNX) today announced updates to the ABBV-RGX-314 clinical program.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 in Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD), Subretinal Delivery\n\nData from the ATMOSPHERE\u00ae and ASCENT\u2122 pivotal trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the subretinal delivery of ABBV-RGX-314 in patients with wet AMD are expected in 2026.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Suprachoroidal Delivery\n\nAbbVie and REGENXBIO will plan a Phase 3 clinical program. The clinical program will utilize the in-office SCS Microinjector\u00ae to deliver gene therapy to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.\n\n\"Retinal diseases are progressive, with wet AMD and DR among the leading causes of blindness,\" said Michael Robinson, M.D., vice president, global head of ophthalmology clinical development, AbbVie. \"More treatment options are needed to help relieve the current treatment burden of chronic, frequent dosing. We are excited to continue moving closer to our goal of delivering an additional treatment option to patients with wet AMD and DR in hopes of addressing their significant unmet needs.\"\n\n\"ABBV-RGX-314 has the potential to help millions of people living with wet AMD and DR, globally, who are facing these debilitating diseases,\" said Curran Simpson, president and chief executive officer, REGENXBIO. \"Together with AbbVie, we are excited to continue developing ABBV-RGX-314 as the first potential one-time gene therapy for wet AMD and DR.\"\n\nAbout ABBV-RGX-314\n\nABBV-RGX-314 is being investigated as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy and potentially other chronic retinal conditions. ABBV-RGX-314 consists of the NAV\u00ae AAV8 vector, which encodes an antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ABBV-RGX-314 is believed to inhibit the VEGF pathway by which new, leaky blood vessels grow and contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the retina.1\n\nAbbVie and REGENXBIO are advancing the development of two separate routes of administration of ABBV-RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as delivery to the suprachoroidal space. REGENXBIO has licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector\u00ae from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.\n\nAbout Wet AMD\n\nWet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina.2 Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to two million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone.3 Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients.4 These therapies, however, require life-long repeated intraocular injections, to maintain efficacy.5,6 Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.7\n\nAbout Diabetic Retinopathy\n\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in adults between 24 and 75 years of age worldwide.8 DR affects nearly 10 million people in the United States alone.9 The spectrum of DR severity ranges from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).4 As DR progresses, a large proportion of patients develop vision threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascularization that can lead to blindness.10 Current treatment options for patients with NPDR typically include \"watchful waiting\" or anti-VEGF treatment. For patients with PDR, current treatment options include anti-VEGF treatment or retinal laser; surgical treatment may be required for advanced PDR.2\n\nAbout AbbVie\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and deliver innovative medicines and solutions that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow. AbbVie strives to have a remarkable impact on people's lives across several key therapeutic areas \u2013 immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and eye care \u2013 and products and services in AbbVie's Allergan Aesthetics portfolio.

The first study, dubbed EMPOWER-1, documented only a slight improvement in scores versus placebo, whereas EMPOWER-2 found that the lower emraclidine dose led to an increase in scores\u2014indicating worsening symptoms.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s stock tanked 12% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nEmraclidine is a next-generation antipsychotic drug candidate that works as a positive allosteric modulator of the muscarinic M4 receptor. Aside from the two schizophrenia studies, AbbVie is also running a Phase I trial of the compound in Alzheimer\u2019s disease psychosis.\n\nAbbVie gained ownership of emraclidine in December 2023 when it dropped $8.7 billion to acquire neuro leader Cerevel Therapeutics.

At 26 weeks, 5 mg of tavapadon improved combined scores on the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale by 9.7 points, indicating better motor performance.

This takes the dividend yield to 3.7%, which shareholders will be pleased with.\n\nView our latest analysis for AbbVie\n\nAbbVie's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 216% of what it was earning, however the dividend was quite comfortably covered by free cash flows at a cash payout ratio of only 74%. Given that the dividend is a cash outflow, we think that cash is more important than accounting measures of profit when assessing the dividend, so this is a mitigating factor.\n\nAnalysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 70%, which is in a comfortable range for us.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Historic Dividend January 13th 2025\n\nAbbVie Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.68 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.56. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThere Isn't Much Room To Grow The Dividend\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that AbbVie has been growing its earnings per share at 5.7% a year over the past five years. While EPS is growing at a decent rate, but future growth could be limited by the amount of earnings being paid out to shareholders.\n\nOur Thoughts On AbbVie's Dividend\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for AbbVie that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

(Nasdaq: RGNX) today announced updates to the ABBV-RGX-314 clinical program.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 in Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD), Subretinal Delivery\n\nData from the ATMOSPHERE\u00ae and ASCENT\u2122 pivotal trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the subretinal delivery of ABBV-RGX-314 in patients with wet AMD are expected in 2026.\n\nABBV-RGX-314 in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Suprachoroidal Delivery\n\nAbbVie and REGENXBIO will plan a Phase 3 clinical program. The clinical program will utilize the in-office SCS Microinjector\u00ae to deliver gene therapy to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.\n\n\"Retinal diseases are progressive, with wet AMD and DR among the leading causes of blindness,\" said Michael Robinson, M.D., vice president, global head of ophthalmology clinical development, AbbVie. \"More treatment options are needed to help relieve the current treatment burden of chronic, frequent dosing. We are excited to continue moving closer to our goal of delivering an additional treatment option to patients with wet AMD and DR in hopes of addressing their significant unmet needs.\"\n\n\"ABBV-RGX-314 has the potential to help millions of people living with wet AMD and DR, globally, who are facing these debilitating diseases,\" said Curran Simpson, president and chief executive officer, REGENXBIO. \"Together with AbbVie, we are excited to continue developing ABBV-RGX-314 as the first potential one-time gene therapy for wet AMD and DR.\"\n\nAbout ABBV-RGX-314\n\nABBV-RGX-314 is being investigated as a potential one-time treatment for wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy and potentially other chronic retinal conditions. ABBV-RGX-314 consists of the NAV\u00ae AAV8 vector, which encodes an antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ABBV-RGX-314 is believed to inhibit the VEGF pathway by which new, leaky blood vessels grow and contribute to the accumulation of fluid in the retina.1\n\nAbbVie and REGENXBIO are advancing the development of two separate routes of administration of ABBV-RGX-314 to the eye, through a standardized subretinal delivery procedure as well as delivery to the suprachoroidal space. REGENXBIO has licensed certain exclusive rights to the SCS Microinjector\u00ae from Clearside Biomedical, Inc. to deliver gene therapy treatments to the suprachoroidal space of the eye.\n\nAbout Wet AMD\n\nWet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina.2 Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to two million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone.3 Current anti-VEGF therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients.4 These therapies, however, require life-long repeated intraocular injections, to maintain efficacy.5,6 Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.7\n\nAbout Diabetic Retinopathy\n\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in adults between 24 and 75 years of age worldwide.8 DR affects nearly 10 million people in the United States alone.9 The spectrum of DR severity ranges from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).4 As DR progresses, a large proportion of patients develop vision threatening complications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascularization that can lead to blindness.10 Current treatment options for patients with NPDR typically include \"watchful waiting\" or anti-VEGF treatment. For patients with PDR, current treatment options include anti-VEGF treatment or retinal laser; surgical treatment may be required for advanced PDR.2\n\nAbout AbbVie\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and deliver innovative medicines and solutions that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow. AbbVie strives to have a remarkable impact on people's lives across several key therapeutic areas \u2013 immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and eye care \u2013 and products and services in AbbVie's Allergan Aesthetics portfolio.

            "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for AbbVie\n\nHow Much Debt Does AbbVie Carry?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of September 2024, AbbVie had US$71.3b of debt, up from US$61.2b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$7.29b in cash, and so its net debt is US$64.0b.\n\nNYSE:ABBV Debt to Equity History January 12th 2025\n\nHow Strong Is AbbVie's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that AbbVie had liabilities of US$43.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$94.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$7.29b in cash and US$11.5b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$118.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nAbbVie has a very large market capitalization of US$309.5b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nAbbVie's net debt of 2.5 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 9.0 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. Unfortunately, AbbVie's EBIT flopped 10% over the last four quarters. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if AbbVie can strengthen its balance sheet over time.

            "content": "These wildly successful companies are poised to keep your dividend portfolio healthy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThere might not be a better place to find winning stocks that can slowly make you wealthy over decades than the healthcare industry. It's an evergreen, multitrillion-dollar market that promotes growth and innovation because better healthcare saves lives.\n\nIf you want to know which healthcare companies to choose to invest in, the answer is easy: Look for those that keep raising dividends. It's not a sure thing, but it's an excellent litmus test because a company must continually innovate, grow, and manage itself well to afford to give more cash to its shareholders every year.\n\nThese three companies are healthcare leaders. They treat their shareholders well and offer promising growth prospects at attractive valuations. Consider buying them in 2025 to boost your dividend portfolio.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nYou won't explore the healthcare field for long before encountering Medtronic (MDT 2.27%). The company develops numerous products, devices, and treatment technologies for dozens of conditions. Its product portfolio ranges from cardiovascular pacemaker devices to glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes. It's a remarkably diverse and consistent business since people need care and treatment around the clock. Since the 1980s, Medtronic's sales haven't dipped more than 10% in a trailing-12-month period.\n\nThat has made it a stellar dividend stock. Medtronic isn't quite a Dividend King yet, but it soon will be. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years. You can't fake or borrow your way to decades of dividend increases. Medtronic's payout ratio is still just 65% of cash flow, so you can trust that the dividend is secure and will likely keep increasing.\n\nMedtronic isn't growing very fast, but it's positioned well for the future. The company has grown its organic revenue at a mid-single-digit rate for the past eight quarters, and analysts estimate the business will grow earnings by about 6% annually over the long term. Lastly, the stock is priced appropriately for its growth at a forward P/E ratio under 15. The stock's 3.5% dividend yield could push annualized total investment returns to 9% to 10%.\n\n2. UnitedHealth Group\n\nInsurance and healthcare services giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH -7.17%) is a key cog in America's healthcare system. It has grown into one of the world's largest corporations, generating over $389 billion in annual revenue. Its massive size enables it to offer more for less than its competitors, so it continues gobbling up patients' dollars in a system that spent $4.9 trillion in 2023 alone. The company operates two primary segments: UnitedHealthcare (insurance) and Optum (care services and technologies).\n\nThe company's seemingly endless growth has fueled 15 consecutive annual dividend increases, averaging 15% per increase for the past five years. Its 1.6% dividend yield isn't enormous but sustained double-digit growth creates significant income over time. Additionally, the dividend consumes only 56% of the company's cash flow. Since analysts estimate UnitedHealth will grow earnings by 15% annually over the long term, investors should reasonably expect more sizable dividend increases and share price gains.\n\nUnitedHealth's stock declined after the insurance segment's CEO was killed in early December, igniting controversy around health insurance in the United States. Lawmakers have since introduced potential legislation to reel back the power that companies like UnitedHealth have in the industry, though it may not pass into law. The stock's recent slide has brought UnitedHealth's valuation down to a forward P/E of 17, a bargain valuation that helps compensate for the company's political risks.\n\n3. AbbVie\n\nPharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) has remained a stalwart in healthcare due to its ability to innovate and find new growth opportunities. Although it was once part of Abbott Labs, AbbVie has thrived independently since its 2013 split. Today, AbbVie's drug portfolio includes immunology, oncology, cosmetics, neuroscience, and eye care treatments. The company has pivoted masterfully after losing patent protection for Humira, its former top-selling product, in 2023.\n\nFew stocks offer a high dividend yield and strong growth, but AbbVie does. The company is also a Dividend King if you count its years with Abbott Labs, which is another impressive feat. AbbVie's stock currently yields 3.4%, and the company has raised its dividend by an average of 8% annually over the past five years. Those increases have gotten smaller these past few years, but that could change if growth ramps back up. The stock's dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 70% of cash flow.\n\nAbbVie's stock has tumbled after its promising schizophrenia drug, the centerpiece of an $8.7 billion acquisition, failed to meet its primary endpoint in phase 2 trials. It was considered a future blockbuster for AbbVie. However, analysts still expect nearly 9% annualized earnings growth over the long term. That's enough growth to make AbbVie an easy buy at its current forward P/E ratio of less than 15.",

            "content": "Specialization and expansion\n\nHow to delay the patent expiration of a blockbuster?\n\nAbbVie was originally just a part of Abbott Laboratories , a company based in Abbott Park, Illinois . The company had two major segments: pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In 2012, the company decided to spin-off its innovative pharmaceutical business out of which AbbVie Inc. was established. The generic drugs business, however, remained with Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie\u2019s new headquarter is located in neighboring Lake Bluff, Illinois. During 2020, AbbVie completed its largest M&A deal so far by acquiring Ireland-based Allergan for 63 billion U.S. dollars. This is one of the biggest M&A deals of the biopharmaceutical history ever Among AbbVie\u2019s various products, Humira (adalimumab) has an outstanding position. Humira is used for the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease . Over the last four years, the product generated annual revenues of about 20 billion U.S. dollars. Before the appearance of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty , Humira was the global top drug based on revenue. In some years, the blockbuster made up around two thirds of the company\u2019s total revenues. Given the threat through patent expiration and generic/biosimilar competition, such a dependence on one product could potentially have negative effects for a pharmaceutical company. Biosimilars of Humira have already been available in several countries since 2014. In AbbVie\u2019s major market, the U.S., Humira started facing biosimilar competition only from 2023, but already combined with heavy revenue losses. AbbVie was quite \u2018famous\u2019, and often criticized, due to its aggressive patent strategy and pricing policy for Humira in the United States: dozens of patents were filed for the drug, but for various medical conditions, while between 2016 and 2021 alone Humira's net price increased by 60 percent.",

The Phase 3 trial could give Pfizer\u2019s subcutaneous immunotherapy an edge over rival drugs, like Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, which are approved to treat people with more advanced disease. Pfizer tested sasanlimab with an immunotherapy called Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin in people whose cancer hadn\u2019t spread beyond the bladder lining after surgery. If sasanlimab wins Food and Drug Administration approval, it could be the fourth PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor cleared as an under-the-skin shot. The FDA has already approved subcutaneous versions of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq and Opdivo, and Merck has positive Phase 3 data in hand for under-the-skin Keytruda. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAbbVie has recorded an approximately $3.5 billion impairment charge related to its purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics, according to a new financial filing. Through its $8.7 billion acquisition, which completed last summer, AbbVie got a pipeline of experimental brain drugs, including one that looked to be a promising new therapy for schizophrenia. But that drug suffered a major clinical setback late last year. The \u201coutright failure\u201d \u2014 as one analyst described it \u2014 was so significant that AbbVie subsequently lost more than $40 billion in market value. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nRoyalty Pharma is simplifying its corporate structure, announcing Friday a deal to absorb the management company that\u2019s run Royalty since its founding in 1996. Royalty will acquire RP Management LLC using equity and some $100 million in cash, along with assuming RP Management\u2019s debt. By internalizing RP Management, Royalty will no longer pay it a 6.5% fee and a small cut of the investments it makes. Royalty expects the roughly $1.1 billion in total transaction value will be \u201cmore than offset\u201d by cash savings of at least $1.6 billion over the next decade. Royalty Pharma acquires stakes in experimental drugs, buying up rights to future royalties once they are approved. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nEli Lilly has licensed rights to an experimental drug for idiopathy pulmonary fibrosis, announcing Friday a deal with biotechnology company Mediar Therapeutics. The antibody drug, dubbed MTX-463, is set to enter Phase 2 testing later this year, which Mediar will handle. Afterwards, Lilly can lead all further development and marketing, a right for which it is paying Mediar $99 million in upfront and near-term milestone fees. Mediar could receive up to $687 million more in additional milestone payments. MTX-463 targets a protein called WISP1 that\u2019s been linked to fibrosis. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics on Friday said it would reduce its workforce by 65% after deciding to refocus its research on immunology and inflammation. As part of the changes, Barinthus\u2019 chief operating officer and chief financial officer will step down, and the company will close a site in the U.K. Notably, Barinthus no longer plans to invest in a hepatitis B treatment it was developing and will instead seek a partner for the program. Moving forward, the firm will prioritize a celiac disease drug program that\u2019s expected to deliver Phase 1 data this year. All told, the changes extend Barinthus\u2019 cash runway into 2027. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nBiogen is adding yet another new member to its leadership team, announcing Thursday the appointment of Adam Feire as head of business development and external innovation. Feire most recently held a top position in Novartis' business development unit. His addition is the latest in a string of changes to Biogen's C-suite that have taken place since Christopher Viehbacher, who led Sanofi for six years, took over as CEO in late 2022. In his short time at the helm, Viehbacher has made dealmaking more of a priority for Biogen, as exemplified by the company\u2019s $7.3 billion purchase of Reata Pharmaceuticals and $1.2 billion acquisition of HI-Bio. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nAlkeus Pharmaceuticals on Thursday said it plans to submit an approval application to the FDA sometime this year for a Stargardt disease drug it\u2019s developing. The drug, called gildeuretinol acetate, has been tested in several trials, among them an open-label study of people in the earliest stages of the progressive eye disease. New results from that study, summarized by Alkeus Thursday, show two more treated individuals had stable vision over two years post-treatment. Alkeus hopes the treatment can preserve sight. Data from a placebo-controlled study are expected this year. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

            "content": "Launched in 2020 to expedite the development of an effective medicine for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial suffered two more disappointments this week as candidates from Denali Therapeutics and AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences missed the study\u2019s primary endpoint, failing to significantly slow disease progression.\n\nFunded by Sean M. Healey\u2014who died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020\u2014and his global asset management firm, the HEALEY trial generated new hope for patients with the intractable neurological disease. Platform trials are a fairly new phenomenon, however, meaning successes have been limited and investigators are still refining the methodology. In a Monday investor note, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis called the trial \u201ca very high-risk/high-reward option.\u201d\n\nAs with any novel venture, HEALEY has experienced challenges. In an earlier interview with BioSpace, Clene Nanomedicine CEO Rob Etherington noted certain inflexibilities in the trial\u2019s protocol in addition to a six-month timeframe that is \u201ctoo short of a window to prove efficacy.\u201d\n\nFor some drug developers, it is also an attractive business proposition. The HEALEY team recruited the first biotechs to the trial by covering some of their costs. \u201cThe good news was they paid for the drug, so we didn\u2019t have to raise money for [that],\u201d Prilenia Therapeutics CEO Michael Hayden told me in September. A platform trial also has the advantage of being patient-centric, using a shared placebo group between all regimens to boost the total number of patients receiving a potentially efficacious drug.\n\nBut nearly five years on, the HEALEY trial has yet to produce a definitive success, instead serving up a string of failures. Hopefuls from Clene, Prilneia, Biohaven, UCB and Seelos Therapeutics all failed to hit the trial\u2019s primary endpoint, and of these, only Prilenia and Clene saw enough positive signals to move their treatments forward. The other programs have all been terminated\u2014a devastating development for the ALS community.\n\nIt has also been hard, of course, on these companies. Seelos filed for bankruptcy in November after trehalose\u2019s failure. That same month, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which runs the HEALEY trial, sued Seelos over the company\u2019s alleged failure to fully pay for the work MGH conducted on its candidate trehalose. Seelos, which has expressed disagreement regarding the data from its regimen in the HEALY trial, particularly concerning the use of Amylyx\u2019s Relyvrio by some participants, is allegedly withholding payment as a result\u2014to the tune of $2 million, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn a March 2024 update, Seelos stated that while the study did not meet statistical significance in the primary and secondary endpoint across all participants, it showed a potential signal of efficacy in a pre-specified subgroup not taking Relyvrio. These patients saw a 22% improvement in slope of change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) assessment adjusted for mortality, with an 89% success probability, at 24 weeks, according to the press release.\n\n\u201cThe HEALEY platform is designed to detect signals of efficacy and we believe the observed signal and success probability is competitive to other recently FDA-approved therapies for ALS which also failed to achieve statistical significance when measured for function and mortality on similar primary and efficacy endpoints,\u201d Seelos CEO Raj Mehra said in the March statement.\n\nRelyvrio received approval in September 2022 as only the third-ever treatment for ALS. Given its subsequent withdrawal from U.S. and Canadian markets in April 2024 after failure to show efficacy in a Phase III trial, it would have been interesting to see how trehalose would have performed under different circumstances.\n\nSignals of Hope\n\nFor followers of the HEALEY trial\u2014and the ALS space in general\u2014pulling signals of efficacy from the rubble is a familiar tune. For Prilenia and Clene, positive biomarker data supported moving their respective programs forward. In Prilenia\u2019s case, a subgroup of patients with early-stage ALS who were rapidly declining had \u201csubstantially less decline\u201d on the ALSFRS-R total score compared to the placebo group. Prilenia submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application to the European Medicines Agency that was accepted in September 2024.\n\nCertainly, there is precedent for moving a program forward based on patient subgroup data.\n\n\u201c[ALS] is heterogeneous, and sometimes it\u2019s really important, even when a drug doesn\u2019t work in everybody, to look at if there\u2019s a subset that might have benefited,\u201d Merit Cudkowicz, director of the Healey & AMG Center for ALS, told me in 2021. Cudkowicz noted that results of the first trial for Radicava, developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe and approved by the FDA in May 2017, were also negative across the overall trial population. However, a subset of early fast progressors did respond, \u201cand when they repeated the studies just in that group, it was positive and that led to marketing.\u201d\n\nAnd embattled Israel and New York\u2013based biotech BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics has consistently pointed to analysis from its Phase III trial of NurOwn showing that a prespecified subgroup of patients with early-stage disease, as determined by an ALSFRS-R baseline score of 35, saw a meaningful response across all primary and secondary endpoints. BrainStorm is now gearing up for a Phase IIIb study that president and CEO Chaim Lebovits said would be focused on these early-stage patients.\n\nAfter a 2024 campaign filled with disappointment, this is a space that desperately needs a break. ALS is uniformly fatal, typically claiming its victims within five years of diagnosis, and the disease continues to confound researchers. Given the dire need for effective treatments, patients, drug developers and journalists alike could be forgiven for celebrating signals of hope.\n\nAs for the HEALEY trial, Cudkowicz shared that the team is currently considering amending the protocol based on learnings from the first five regimens.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that it is not a perfect clinical trial. It has its flaws,\u201d Graig Suvannavejh, senior biopharmaceuticals and biotechnology equity research analyst at Mizuho Americas, told me. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re trying to fix the situation at HEALEY.\u201d",

This decision follows the company's recent evaluation of the asset, which was acquired through the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe impairment charge comes in the wake of disappointing results from two Phase 2 EMPOWER trials. These trials were designed to assess emraclidine as a once-daily, oral monotherapy for adults with schizophrenia experiencing acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately, the trials did not meet their primary endpoint, failing to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score compared to the placebo group at week six.\n\nAs a result of these outcomes, AbbVie conducted a thorough evaluation of the emraclidine intangible asset, leading to a substantial decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product. Consequently, the company has recorded a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of approximately $3.5 billion.\n\nDespite this setback, AbbVie remains committed to its clinical development programs related to Cerevel and will continue to monitor the remaining intangible assets, which are valued at approximately $3.6 billion. The company is actively evaluating information to determine the future course of action for these assets.\n\nThis development underscores the inherent risks in pharmaceutical research and development, where clinical trial outcomes can significantly impact financial projections and asset valuations. Investors and stakeholders will be closely watching AbbVie's next steps as it navigates this challenging phase.\n\nShould you invest in AbbVie Inc (ABBV, Financial) right now?

            "content": "In this episode of Eureka!, a McKinsey podcast on innovation in life sciences R&D, cohosts Navraj Nagra, Alex Devereson, and Erika Stanzl speak with Howard Jacob, vice president of genomics research and head of data integration at AbbVie. They discuss AbbVie\u2019s early leap into data integration, what\u2019s wrong with medical silos, the vast potential of AI and machine learning (ML), and building capabilities. They also consider the potential of genomic sequencing to identify disease cohorts and a future in which cures trump treatment across the healthcare system.\n\nAn edited version of their conversation follows.\n\nHow AI and ML can advance genomic research\n\nNavraj Nagra: How have the twists and turns of your life and career led you to AbbVie?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019ve been interested in science since age five. I wanted to be a marine biologist until my junior year in college. Then I worked as a summer technician at Abbott Laboratories and decided drug discovery would be of interest. I got my PhD in pharmacology, did postdocs in genomics, and spent 30 years in faculty, and now I'm working at AbbVie, a spinout of Abbott. So it\u2019s a full circle. I started here, got interested in pharmacology, and now I\u2019m back.\n\nErika Stanzl: For context, can you tell us about AbbVie and the areas you focus on?\n\nHoward Jacob: I was hired to lead the AbbVie Genomics Research Center, a global organization that covers data generation for omics ; all the computational teams; functional genomics; CRISPR screening; human genetics; and pharmacogenomics. Our large group of about 140 people helps the organization from early discovery through corporate strategy, biologics manufacturing, and postmarket analysis. My other job is leading R&D data integration across all 12,600 people that do research at AbbVie. Our advantage is having all this wonderful, centralized data we need to do AI and ML.\n\nErika Stanzl: How is AbbVie using AI and ML, and what successes have you had to date?\n\nHoward Jacob: It took Philip Hajduk [vice president of R&D information research at AbbVie] and his team several years to build a platform; integrate all our data, including clinical trial data; put policies in place; and get people on board. We have about two billion edges in our knowledge graph. I felt that because AI and ML had been promised for 30 years, we had some time, but wow! It has just taken off in the past year or even six months.\n\nInside AbbVie, we have begun to look at everything within the past year\u2014early target discovery, target development, biologics design, and patient recruitment and engagement. The uptake is just extraordinary, and I\u2019m glad we put the infrastructure in place so we could start running fast. We\u2019ve gone from thinking about this to sprinting, so it\u2019s been a heck of a year.\n\nUsing data to find better healthcare solutions\n\nAlex Devereson: On that note, which therapeutic areas, specifically within your expertise\u2014genomics, research, and precision medicine\u2014are you most excited about?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019m most excited about looking at all the data to start really thinking about cures. We put a cures program in place a few years ago, but pulling the information together has been a challenge. Now, we have all the data, including external data, in one place, and we can use AI and ML to ask questions and identify patterns. For example, we\u2019ve been looking at the molecular fingerprints of disease, and we\u2019ve found hundreds of genes, but that isn\u2019t practical for making a diagnostic. With AI and ML, we can distill it down to a smaller number of key genes that we can use to create a diagnostic. That\u2019s a huge change.\n\nMedicine today is based on disciplines such as rheumatology, dermatology, and oncology, but the body doesn\u2019t know about those fields; it\u2019s just trying to maintain homeostasis. Now, with all this data and the ability to analyze it, we\u2019re going to find indication expansion and better definitions of disease. We\u2019re going to realize these fields overlap and the way we practice medicine is ultrarigid. We\u2019re not going to have to do it that way anymore.\n\nWe sometimes compare AI and ML outputs with perfection instead of comparing them with what we would have delivered in the absence of technology. We\u2019re in a phase of tremendous skepticism, and everybody is pointing out where AI and ML don\u2019t work instead of saying we need to keep improving them. Building trust is the key. We have to elevate the conversation to focus on what they do well and how we can leverage them to continue to get better. I saw the same thing when genomics was first coming out. People felt it was a waste of money. We don\u2019t have those conversations anymore. The difference here is the ultrafast speed at which AI and ML are getting adopted.\n\nNavraj Nagra: How do you think about building data capabilities internally and partnering with the business to ensure there is uptake of those capabilities?\n\nHoward Jacob: Building capabilities is an interesting challenge. In a recent presentation to a subset of the board, I said AbbVie is a science-driven company using data to make drugs, but in the future, we\u2019ll be a data-driven company using science to make drugs. We\u2019re going to need new talent, infrastructure, and data navigation capabilities. We\u2019re also going to need to put policies in place to use the data and get more comfortable making investments in places we hadn\u2019t thought about before.\n\nWe need people who can take massive amounts of data and turn it into something scientists can use. We need computational power. Any given pharma company probably doesn\u2019t have enough data on its own, so how do we aggregate data and add healthcare data? Everyone also needs to have the right guardrails in place to ensure data protection and responsible AI use while also keeping up with an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nA mission to deliver more holistic care to patients\n\nErika Stanzl: Do you have any other passion projects at AbbVie that would be fun for listeners to hear about and that speaks to your soul?\n\nHoward Jacob: I\u2019m excited about partnering with our patients for discovery through the AbbVie Research Collaborative. We want to learn from them and give them a voice. We think we can create a safe environment and give people information about diseases from a credible, trusted source. We\u2019re all living experiments. If we come back to the fact that medicine is divided into fields, all of us have multiple things happening in our lives physiologically. Nobody has only one disease, yet we treat diseases in isolation. What if we started looking at it from a holistic perspective? So that\u2019s my passion.\n\nNavraj Nagra: At a time when there is this mass democratization, particularly of genomic data, how are you and AbbVie thinking about using it to diagnose and deliver care to patients?\n\nHoward Jacob: We\u2019ve retrospectively gone back into our clinical trials and sequenced genomes, and we found information that would have been great to know ahead of time. Now we\u2019re going back in and using this information for biomarkers and so forth. We\u2019re also starting to get patient data sets from genome sequencing and transcriptomics so we can design better clinical trials.\n\nNavraj Nagra: Most healthcare today is organized at the population level. As more people start to understand their personalized risk scores, it could completely change the way medicine is practiced. But is the healthcare system, which is already under massive strain, ready to adopt that level of change?\n\nHoward Jacob: Today, we have a disease care system not a healthcare system. We respond to crisis, and that\u2019s how we practice medicine. We don\u2019t want to spend money until there\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s how our system is built, and that\u2019s how compensation works. Preventative care is actually healthcare. As a company, we think about cures. We have programs to cure. That\u2019s healthcare versus disease care. We\u2019re starting to see those intellectual shifts that hopefully will lead to change.",

Capsida will receive a $40 million license payment and is eligible for additional milestones and royalties.\n\nThe opt-in decision was based on results from primate studies using Capsida\u2019s engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids to deliver AbbVie\u2019s novel therapeutic cargo intravenously (IV). Broad neuronal expression was achieved while simultaneously de-targeting the liver and dorsal root ganglia. AbbVie will be responsible for advancing the program into IND-enabling studies and performing clinical trials, while Capsida will be responsible for manufacturing.\n\n\u201cMoving the first neurodegeneration program forward is a testament to the successful and collaborative work between Capsida and AbbVie. We look forward to continuing to advance this promising therapy for patients,\u201d said Peter Anastasiou, Chief Executive Officer of Capsida. \u201cAbbVie\u2019s option exercise demonstrates the potential high performance of Capsida\u2019s IV-delivered AAV technology. In addition, we are looking forward to advancing two of our wholly owned CNS programs into clinical trials in the first half of 2025.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional AAV capsids for the treatment of neurological disorders, have faced challenges such as limited targeting specificity, reduced efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier and off-target effects,\u201d said Jonathon Sedgwick, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Global Head, Discovery Research at AbbVie. \u201cThe development of neurotropic capsids is important for addressing such challenges, which is designed to enable more targeted delivery of genetic medicine therapeutics to the central nervous system. We are pleased with the progress of our collaboration with Capsida and look forward to continuing to advance this work together to help patients with neurodegenerative diseases.\u201d\n\nThe milestone is part of a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement announced in 2021, in which Capsida and AbbVie partnered to develop targeted genetic medicine therapies for three neurodegenerative diseases. The collaboration is based on Capsida\u2019s novel AAV engineering platform and IV-administered capsids that broadly transduce neurons across the brain and are the backbone of Capsida\u2019s wholly owned pipeline. The other two collaboration programs continue to advance, and one program includes the potential for Capsida to co-develop and co-commercialize upon AbbVie\u2019s opting-in. Under the terms of the original agreement, Capsida previously received $80 million up-front in cash and a $10 million equity investment.

            "content": "When markets get unpredictable, many investors turn to blue-chip stocks for stability. These companies are known for their solid financials, steady growth, and reliable dividends, making them a wise choice for anyone looking to weather economic ups and downs.\n\nBelow, I have highlighted three fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks from the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) that one could consider investing in the near term.\n\nHealthcare stocks, in particular, have a reputation for being dependable. They often hold up well during tough economic times because the need for healthcare doesn\u2019t go away, no matter what the market is doing. In fact, healthcare is the third-largest industry in the S&P 500, and it\u2019s poised for growth. PwC expects medical costs to rise 8% in 2025 for group markets, driven by inflation, prescription drug spending, and higher demand for mental health services.\n\nAt the same time, inflation persists. In November, consumer prices rose at a 2.7% annual rate, slightly higher than in October. As a result, the Federal Open Market Committee adjusted its monetary policy, cutting the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%. With uncertainty looming over the stock market, investors can look to invest in blue-chip stocks that offer stability, value, and diversification, shielding investments from potential downturns.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s evaluate the three Medical \u2013 Pharmaceuticals picks, beginning with the third choice.\n\nStock #3: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nJNJ is engaged in researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling healthcare products primarily focused on human health and well-being. The company offers a diversified range of products through the Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments.\n\nOn December 30, 2024, JNJ announced that the European Commission approved RYBREVANT\u00ae (amivantamab) in combination with LAZCLUZE\u2122 (lazertinib) for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults with EGFR mutations. This chemotherapy-free combination has shown superior efficacy compared to Osimertinib monotherapy for treating EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\n\nLast year, in August, JNJ acquired V-Wave Ltd., a privately held company specializing in innovative heart failure treatment. The deal included an upfront payment of $60 million, with the potential for additional payments of up to $1.1 billion. This acquisition is set to enhance JNJ MedTech\u2019s position in the cardiovascular space, broadening its portfolio of advanced heart failure treatment options.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, which ended on September 29, JNJ\u2019s sales to customers increased 5.2% year-over-year to $22.47 billion. Its gross profit rose 5.2% from the year-ago value to $15.51 billion, while its adjusted net earnings from continuing operations amounted to $5.88 billion or $2.42 per share in the same period. Also, the company\u2019s free cash flow for the quarter increased 16.9% year-over-year to $14 billion.\n\nAs per the updated guidance for the fiscal year 2024, JNJ forecasts operational sales between $89.20 billion and $89.60 billion, a 6% increase from 2023, primarily driven by recent acquisitions. The company also expects adjusted EPS between $9.97 and $10.07.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $88.79 billion for the fiscal year 2024, which ended on December 31, represents a 4.3% increase year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $9.96 for the same period indicates a marginal improvement year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history; it surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nThe stock has gained 1.1% year-to-date to close the last trading session at $146.23.\n\nJNJ\u2019s POWR Ratings reflect its promising outlook. The stock has an overall rating of A, which equates to a Strong Buy in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nJNJ has a B grade for Value, Stability, Sentiment, and Quality. It is ranked #14 out of 152 stocks in the Medical \u2013 Pharmaceuticals industry. Click here to see the additional ratings for JNJ (Growth and Momentum).\n\nStock #2: Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK)\n\nMRK is a global healthcare company offering health solutions through its prescription medicines, including biologic therapies, vaccines, and animal health products. It operates through two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.\n\nOn January 8, 2025, MRK announced that China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved GARDASIL\u00ae (Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent Vaccine, Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) for use in males aged 9 to 26. With this approval, GARDASIL became the first HPV vaccine authorized in China for preventing HPV-related cancers and diseases in males.\n\nOn November 19, the company\u2019s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share of the company\u2019s common stock for the first quarter of 2025. This dividend was paid to its shareholders on January 8, 2025.\n\nWith 14 years of consecutive dividend growth, MRK\u2019s annual dividend of $3.24 translates to a yield of 3.21% on the current share price. Its four-year average yield is 2.87%. The company\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of 6.1% over the past three years.\n\nMRK\u2019s sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 4.4% year-over-year to $16.66 billion, while its KEYTRUDA product sales improved by 17.2% from the year-ago value to $ 7.43 billion. The company\u2019s non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter stood at $3.98 billion and $1.57, respectively.\n\nAccording to the full-year 2024 guidance, MRK forecasts worldwide sales to range from $63.60 billion to $64.10 billion, an increase from the previous guidance of $63.40 billion to $64.40 billion. The company also expects non-GAAP EPS to be between $7.72 and $7.77.\n\nAnalysts expect MRK\u2019s revenue for the fourth quarter (ended December 2024) to increase 5.9% year-over-year to $15.49 billion, while its EPS for the same period is expected to grow significantly from the prior year to $1.80. Moreover, the company topped the consensus revenue estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nThe stock has gained marginally year-to-date to close the last trading session at $99.85.\n\nIt is no surprise that MRK has an overall rating of A, equating to a Strong Buy in our POWR Ratings system. It also has an A grade for Quality and a B for Value and Stability. Within the same industry, it is ranked #8 out of 152 stocks.\n\nIn addition to the POWR Rating grades I\u2019ve just highlighted, you can see MRK\u2019s Growth, Momentum, and Sentiment ratings here.\n\nStock #1: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\n\nABBV is a global diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company engaged in manufacturing and selling medications and therapies. It offers a comprehensive product portfolio across Immunology, Oncology, Neuroscience, Eye Care, Aesthetics, and Other Specialties.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, ABBV announced the acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to strengthen its immunology pipeline further. The deal includes Nimble\u2019s lead asset, an investigational oral peptide IL-23R inhibitor currently in preclinical development for psoriasis, as well as a pipeline of innovative oral peptide candidates targeting various autoimmune diseases with significant unmet needs.\n\nAdditionally, ABBV will gain access to Nimble\u2019s proprietary peptide synthesis, screening, and optimization platform, designed to enable the discovery and optimization of oral peptide therapeutics.\n\nOn October 30, the company\u2019s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from $1.55 to $1.64 per share, payable on February 14, 2025 to the shareholders of record on January 15, 2025. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.8%, continuing ABBV\u2019s strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend.\n\nIt pays an annual dividend of $6.56, which translates to a yield of 3.65% at the current share price. Its four-year average dividend yield is 3.89%. Moreover, the company\u2019s dividend payouts have increased at an impressive CAGR of 7.7% over the past five years.\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter (ended September 30, 2024), ABBV\u2019s net revenue increased 3.8% year-over-year to $14.46 billion, while the company\u2019s Neuroscience segment reported net revenue of $2.36 billion, indicating a 15.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.

            "content": "Capsida to receive a $40 million license payment and is eligible for additional milestones and royalties\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Jan. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Capsida Biotherapeutics (\"Capsida\") today announced that AbbVie has exercised an option for the first neurodegenerative disease program under their ongoing collaboration. Capsida will receive a $40 million license payment and is eligible for additional milestones and royalties.\n\nThe opt-in decision was based on results from primate studies using Capsida's engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids to deliver AbbVie's novel therapeutic cargo intravenously (IV). Broad neuronal expression was achieved while simultaneously de-targeting the liver and dorsal root ganglia. AbbVie will be responsible for advancing the program into IND-enabling studies and performing clinical trials, while Capsida will be responsible for manufacturing.\n\n\"Moving the first neurodegeneration program forward is a testament to the successful and collaborative work between Capsida and AbbVie. We look forward to continuing to advance this promising therapy for patients,\" said Peter Anastasiou, Chief Executive Officer of Capsida. \"AbbVie's option exercise demonstrates the potential high performance of Capsida's IV-delivered AAV technology. In addition, we are looking forward to advancing two of our wholly owned CNS programs into clinical trials in the first half of 2025.\"\n\n\"Traditional AAV capsids for the treatment of neurological disorders, have faced challenges such as limited targeting specificity, reduced efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier and off-target effects,\" said Jonathon Sedgwick, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Global Head, Discovery Research at AbbVie. \"The development of neurotropic capsids is important for addressing such challenges, which is designed to enable more targeted delivery of genetic medicine therapeutics to the central nervous system. We are pleased with the progress of our collaboration with Capsida and look forward to continuing to advance this work together to help patients with neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\nThe milestone is part of a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement announced in 2021, in which Capsida and AbbVie partnered to develop targeted genetic medicine therapies for three neurodegenerative diseases. The collaboration is based on Capsida's novel AAV engineering platform and IV-administered capsids that broadly transduce neurons across the brain and are the backbone of Capsida's wholly owned pipeline. The other two collaboration programs continue to advance, and one program includes the potential for Capsida to co-develop and co-commercialize upon AbbVie's opting-in. Under the terms of the original agreement, Capsida previously received $80 million up-front in cash and a $10 million equity investment. For the newly licensed program, Capsida is eligible to receive additional development and commercial milestones plus tiered royalties on future product sales.\n\nAbout Capsida Biotherapeutics\n\nCapsida Biotherapeutics is a fully integrated gene therapy company with a central nervous system (CNS) pipeline consisting of disease modifying and potentially curative treatments for rare and more common diseases across all ages. Capsida's wholly owned pipeline includes a potential first-in-class treatment for STXBP1 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, best-in-class treatment for Parkinson's disease associated with GBA mutations, and best-in-class therapy for Friedreich's ataxia. In addition to its wholly owned programs, the Company has validating partnerships with AbbVie, Lilly, and CRISPR Therapeutics. Capsida was founded in 2019 by lead investors Versant Ventures and Westlake Village BioPartners and originated from groundbreaking research in the laboratory of Viviana Gradinaru, Ph.D., a neuroscience professor at Caltech.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this metric is pegged at $10.96.\n\nIncluding the acquired IPR&D and milestone expense, the fourth-quarter adjusted EPS guided range was lowered to $2.06-$2.10 from $2.94-$2.98. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.99 per share.\n\nThe above projection does not impact AbbVie\u2019s previously issued guidance for 2024 revenues, which are expected to be around $56 billion.

The downward revision is primarily due to expenses of about $1.6 billion incurred from several acquisitions made in 2024. These one-time charges are likely to negatively impact adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by $0.88 in the fourth quarter.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nAs a result of this one-time expense, ABBV expects to report adjusted EPS in the range of $10.02 to $10.06 for 2024, compared to the prior projection of $10.90 to $10.94. Also, the company now anticipates that its fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS will lie between $2.06 and $2.10, down from the previous expectations of $2.94 to $2.98.\n\nInvestors should note that AbbVie is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on January 31.\n\nAbbVie Bolsters Portfolio with Strategic Acquisitions\n\nAbbVie actively expanded its portfolio in 2024 with the help of strategic acquisitions. The company acquired Cerevel Therapeutics, a neuroscience drug maker; ImmunoGen, a cancer drug developer; and Aliada Therapeutics, an Alzheimer\u2019s therapy developer.\n\nThese deals had a combined value of more than $20 billion. These acquisitions aimed to bolster the company\u2019s growth, particularly after the loss of patent protection for its blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira.\n\nIs ABBV Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, ABBV has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and six Holds assigned in the last three months. At $202.75, the average AbbVie price target implies a 12.58% upside potential. Over the past six months, ABBV has surged by more than 10%.\n\nSee more ABBV analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering AbbVie (ABBV), which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry.\n\nThis drugmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.93%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, AbbVie came out with earnings of $3 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 per share, representing a surprise of 2.74%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.65 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.11%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for AbbVie lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAbbVie has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 31, 2025.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Semaglutides Market Report 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThis Semaglutides market report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market. It traces the market's historic and forecast market growth by geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size has grown rapidly in recent years. It will grow from $20.54 billion in 2023 to $23.07 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3%. The growth during the historic period can be attributed to lifestyle changes leading to higher diabetes prevalence, increased investment in research and development, rising healthcare expenditure, the expansion of pharmaceutical companies into developing regions, and growing acceptance of injectable therapies.\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years. It will grow to $36.87 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to the increasing global prevalence of diabetes, rising awareness about diabetes management and treatment, growing demand for effective therapies with fewer side effects, supportive government initiatives and policies for diabetes treatment, and an aging population contributing to higher diabetes incidence.\n\nMajor trends expected during this period include the integration of digital health technologies, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, increased demand for telemedicine and remote monitoring, development of wearable technology, the use of 3D printing, and the application of blockchain for supply chain management.\n\n\n\nThe rising prevalence of diabetes is anticipated to drive the expansion of the semaglutide market in the coming years. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. The increasing incidence of diabetes is largely attributed to factors such as rising obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and poor dietary habits. Semaglutide plays a key role in diabetes management by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which stimulates insulin secretion, reduces glucagon release, and slows gastric emptying, thereby helping to lower blood glucose levels and support weight loss.\n\nFor example, in November 2021, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), a Belgium-based non-profit organization, reported that approximately 537 million people globally are living with diabetes. This number has been steadily increasing, with the IDF projecting that by 2.04 trillion people will have diabetes, representing a 46% rise. As a result, the growing prevalence of diabetes is driving the expansion of the semaglutide market.\n\n\n\nKey players in the semaglutide market are focusing on developing products such as GLP-1 receptor analogues to enhance the effectiveness of treatments for diabetes and obesity, improve patient adherence, and reduce side effects through advanced delivery systems and personalized medicine approaches. A GLP-1 receptor analogue is a synthetic peptide that mimics the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases insulin secretion and regulates blood sugar levels in diabetes management.\n\nFor instance, in January 2022, Novo Nordisk India, an India-based pharmaceutical company, launched oral semaglutide, marking a significant advancement in diabetes treatment. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor analogue (GLP-1 RA) traditionally available only as an injection, was developed in an oral form for the first time. This oral version combines semaglutide with an absorption enhancer known as SNAC, which protects the medication from degradation in the stomach and enhances its absorption.\n\n\n\nIn May 2024, Novo Holdings, a Denmark-based life sciences company, acquired Catalent for $16.5 billion. This strategic acquisition aims to strengthen Novo Holdings' portfolio by incorporating Catalent's expertise in drug delivery technologies, biologics, and gene therapies, thereby bolstering its position in the global healthcare market. Catalent, Inc. is a US-based company involved in the production of semaglutide.\n\n\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the semaglutides market in 2023. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the semaglutides market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa. The countries covered in the semaglutides market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA, Canada, Italy, Spain.\n\nSome of the major companies profiled in this Semaglutides market report include:\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\nRoche Holding AG\n\nMerck & Co.

Abbott investors who wisely held on to shares of the biopharmaceutical spinoff have seen the dividend payments they deliver soar by 310%. You might expect a stock that raises its dividend this fast to have a low yield, but it actually offers a juicy 3.6% at recent prices.\n\nAbbVie stock has been beaten down recently because an $8.7 billion investment the company made in Cerevel Therapeutics in 2023 hasn't worked out as planned. This November, we learned that Emraclidine, the experimental treatment that attracted AbbVie to Cerevel, failed to improve symptoms for schizophrenia patients in a pair of phase 2 trials.\n\nLuckily for AbbVie, Cerevel quickly redeemed itself. Tavapadon, a potential first-in-class Parkinson's disease treatment it was developing, met its primary endpoint in the phase 3 Tempo-2 trial. Treatment with the D1/D5 partial agonist significantly improved patients' disease rating scores after 26 weeks of treatment.\n\nIn a few years, tavapadon could begin generating billions in annual revenue. AbbVie looks like a great stock to buy because it can continue raising its dividend at a rapid pace even without a new Parkinson's disease drug.\n\nAbbVie's lead drug by sales, Skyrizi, launched in 2019, and it's already dominating the market for psoriasis medications. During the first nine months of 2024, sales of the injectable treatment rose 48% year over year to $7.9 billion.\n\nSkyrizi isn't the only relatively young drug pushing up sales for AbbVie. In the first nine months of 2024, Rinvoq, an arthritis treatment that also launched in 2019, grew sales by 52% year over year to reach $4.1 billion.\n\nDuring the 12-month period that ended last September, AbbVie generated $15.6 billion in free cash flow. The company used only 70% of this sum to meet its dividend obligation. With Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and possibly tavapadon to push sales higher, patient investors could receive heaps of passive income from this stock over the long run.\n\n2. W.P. Carey\n\nW.P. Carey is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that collects rent from a variety of different businesses that sign long-term net leases. Income-seeking investors love these types of stocks because they have to deliver at least 90% of their profit to investors as dividend payments. At recent prices, W.P. Carey's dividend offers a big 6.4% yield at recent prices.\n\nShares of this well-run REIT have been under pressure for a couple of reasons that aren't significant to income-seeking investors considering a new investment in the stock. In 2023, it made a difficult decision to spin off its office building portfolio into a separate entity and lower its dividend payout accordingly.\n\nDeclining rents from offices was an unexpected problem that W.P. Carey dealt with in the best way possible. This nuance doesn't come across for every stability-seeking investor who pulls up its dividend chart.\n\nA recent dividend cut isn't the only issue pressuring W.P. Carey's stock price. Bond traders expecting stronger economic growth, higher inflation, and rising debt pushed yields on 10-year Treasury notes through the roof over the past few months. When Treasury yields rise, shares of riskier income-generating assets like REIT stocks fall.\n\nTaking advantage of W.P. Carey's beaten-down price gives investors a great chance to see a big dividend yield grow further. The company's largest tenant, Extra Space Storage, is resilient to economic downturns and contributes just 2.7% of the REIT's annualized base rent.\n\nThe well-diversified REIT has already raised its dividend payout four times since lowering it in 2023. Despite recent raises, there's plenty of room for more. Management expects adjusted funds from operations, a proxy for earnings used to evaluate REITs, to reach $4.68 at the midpoint of its guided range. That's heaps more than it needs to meet a dividend payment currently set at just $3.52 annually.\n\nAdding some shares of this highly resilient dividend payer to a diverse portfolio now and holding it for the long run looks like a great way for most income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.",

Katerina Simonetti, Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management senior vice president, recently predicted that market growth will slow down in 2025 and that it will be another year in which investors will focus on the Fed and inflation. In this context, dividend stocks are worth watching for portfolio diversification and consistent income.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAbout two years ago, someone ran a poll on r/Dividends \u2013 a popular discussion board on Reddit \u2013 to ask income investors whether anyone was living off dividends. The question received over one hundred comments, with many sharing interesting stories about their dividend investing journeys. An investor said he made around $68,000 in dividend income annually and lived entirely off this income for about four years. However, he found it \"extremely boring.\"\n\n\"So I found something to do in the afternoons and that\u2019s turned into a decent paying part-time gig. And so did my wife.

            "content": "AbbVie India Violates UCPMP, 2024\n\nThe recent actions of AbbVie Healthcare India Private Ltd have brought attention to the ethical standards in pharmaceutical marketing. The company was found guilty of violating the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP), 2024. An anonymous report revealed that AbbVie sponsored international trips for doctors, which constituted a breach of regulations designed to promote ethical conduct in the industry.\n\nAbout UCPMP 2024\n\nThe UCPMP 2024 is a regulatory framework governing interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals in India. It prohibits pharmaceutical companies from offering gifts, benefits, or any financial advantages to healthcare professionals and their families. The code aims to maintain transparency and ethical practices within the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nKey Regulations of UCPMP 2024\n\nThe UCPMP 2024 explicitly forbids companies from providing travel facilities or hospitality to healthcare professionals, except in specified educational programmes. However, it does allow for the provision of informational materials and free samples, provided they meet certain conditions. This code replaces the earlier UCPMP 2014 and applies equally to medical device companies.\n\nThe Doctor-Pharma Relationship\n\nThe relationship between doctors and pharmaceutical companies has long been scrutinised due to potential conflicts of interest. Financial incentives can influence prescribing practices, even if the gifts are small. The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics marks the importance of self-awareness among doctors to mitigate these biases and uphold ethical standards.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s Justification and Consequences\n\nIn response to the allegations, AbbVie claimed that their actions were an \u2018acceptable industry practice\u2019 and cited a professional service agreement with the involved doctors. However, the company rejected suggestions for remedial actions, leading to repercussions. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has been tasked with evaluating the tax implications for both AbbVie and the implicated doctors.\n\nImportance of Strict Enforcement\n\nExperts emphasise the need for stringent enforcement of the UCPMP to prevent conflicts of interest and encourage trust in the medical community. The Indian pharmaceutical industry is a global leader, supplying a vast array of generic drugs and maintaining a strong domestic market. The industry\u2019s growth necessitates adherence to ethical practices to sustain its reputation.\n\nUCPMP stands for Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices. AbbVie Healthcare is a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc, based in the USA. The Indian pharmaceutical market was valued at USD 42 billion in 2021. India exports pharmaceuticals to over 200 countries. The National Medical Council regulates ethical practices for Indian doctors.\n\nFuture Directions in Pharmaceutical Ethics\n\nThe ongoing scrutiny of pharmaceutical marketing practices may lead to more stringent regulations and oversight. It is crucial for the industry to adapt to these changes to ensure compliance and maintain public trust.\n\nMonth: Current Affairs - January, 2025\n\nCategory: Legal & Constitution Current Affairs",

            "content": "If you're worried about having enough passive income to maintain your lifestyle during retirement, you're not alone. Having to spend more just to maintain their current standard of living is a constant concern for most families.\n\nThere isn't much that you can do to stop the march of inflation, but you can prepare. Filling your portfolio with dividend-paying stocks that raise their quarterly payouts faster than the underlying inflation rate could even lead to extra spending cash.\n\nMedtronic (MDT 2.27%), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.07%), and AbbVie (ABBV 0.60%) have many years of reliable dividend growth under their belts. If there's one corner of the economy investors can count on to grow in good and bad macroeconomic conditions, it's the healthcare sector.\n\nYou can put off buying a new car for years, but medical conditions rarely give customers of these companies an option. Here's how adding them to your portfolio and holding them over the coming decade gives you a great chance to realize a growing passive income stream.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic got started with pacemakers in the 1950s. Cardiovascular devices such as leadless pacemakers and replacement valves are still a large part of the business, but there's much more. For example, it markets implantable devices that can alleviate chronic back pain.\n\nSurgeons all over the world employing a growing suite of Medtronic's minimally invasive solutions have allowed the company to raise its dividend for 47 consecutive years. At recent prices, the stock offers an attractive 3.5% yield.\n\nIn the U.S. and other developed nations, populations are aging. Older folks use a lot of healthcare, which is driving up overall spending. The U.S. spent $4.9 trillion on healthcare in 2023, which was 7.5% more than it spent a year earlier.\n\nLast year, Medtronic generated a healthy $5.5 billion in free cash flow but needed just 66% of this sum to meet its dividend obligation. With the unstoppable trend toward increasing healthcare expenses at its back, investors can reasonably expect plenty more dividend payout raises in the years ahead.\n\n2. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nIn the U.S., spending on prescription drugs rose 11.4% year over year to $450 billion in 2023. With this tailwind at its back, Bristol Myers Squibb has been able to raise its dividend payout for 16 consecutive years. The stock offers a 4.3% yield at recent prices.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb stock has been under pressure because there are aging blockbusters in its product lineup that could lose market share soon. For example, Eliquis is an oral blood thinner that racked up $3 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2024. It's responsible for 25% of total revenue but will likely begin competing with generic versions in the U.S. beginning in 2028.\n\nWhile Bristol Myers Squibb could lose Eliquis revenue in a few years, its portfolio of more recently launched drugs with longer periods of market exclusivity could more than offset the losses. The company's growth portfolio, which contributes 49% of total sales, grew third-quarter sales by 18% year over year.\n\nRecently, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable version of Bristol Myers Squibb's blockbuster cancer therapy, Opdivo. Sales of the infused version of the immunotherapy rose to $2.3 billion in the third quarter. An easy-to-administer injectable version that's interchangeable with the infusion could allow Bristol Myers Squibb to retain Opdivo revenue when the infused version begins losing patent-protected market exclusivity a few years from now.\n\n3. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie is another big pharmaceutical company made of many pieces moving in opposite directions. Its former lead drug is an anti-inflammatory injection called Humira.\n\nAt recent prices, AbbVie stock offers a 3.7% yield. The company has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since spinning off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.\n\nCompetition with lower-cost biosimilar versions of Humira is hammering sales of the blockbuster injection. In the first nine months of 2024, AbbVie reported Humira sales that fell 34% year over year to $7.3 billion.\n\nDespite huge Humira losses, total revenue during the first nine months of 2024 rose by 3% year over year. A pair of drugs that launched in 2019, Skyrizi for psoriasis and Rinvoq for arthritis, are offsetting Humira losses on their own.\n\nIn the third quarter, sales of Skyrizi rose 51% year over year to reach an annualized $12.8 billion. Rinvoq sales bounded 45% higher year over year to an annualized $6.4 billion.\n\nWith the heaviest Humira losses already in its rearview, AbbVie could grow by a high single-digit percentage in 2025 and beyond. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio now looks like a great idea for most income-seeking investors.",

This makes the dividend yield 3.7%, which is above the industry average.\n\nAbbVie's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, AbbVie's dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Generally, we think cash is more important than accounting measures of profit, so with the cash flows easily covering the dividend, we don't think there is much reason to worry.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 70%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.\n\nAbbVie Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $1.68 total annually to $6.56. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that AbbVie has grown earnings per share at 5.7% per year over the past five years. While EPS is growing at a decent rate, but future growth could be limited by the amount of earnings being paid out to shareholders.\n\nOur Thoughts On AbbVie's Dividend\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is AbbVie not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Upon the Fed's first interest rate cut of the year in September, global investors flocked to US corporate bonds at the fastest pace in six months following two-consecutive months of outflows from the sector, a recent note from Citi said.\n\nEven before the Fed's easing cycle, strong demand from investors also helped bring down costs, as high-grade corporate debt neared its safest level in nearly a decade.\n\nCorporate giants rushed to take advantage, often looking to bond sales to help fund acquisitions.\n\nPharma giant AbbVie sold $15 billion in investment-grade bonds last February, helping fund acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, while Cisco raked in proceeds of nearly $14 billion from a bond sale in the same month to partly finance its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb, meanwhile, sold $13 billion in bonds to help fund two other acquisitions.\n\nGoing forward, the outlook for corporate borrowing is slightly murkier.\n\nRecent hawkish commentary from Fed officials has hurt hopes for significant monetary easing in 2025. Traders are now penciling in just one or two more cuts over the course of the year amid concerns over sticky inflation.\n\nCitia analysts said they expect a resilient US economy to help provide further growth for investment-grade bonds overall, though.\n\n\"Resilience in U.S. economic activity, despite still-restrictive monetary policy, raises the chances from our prior baseline that U.S. IG EBITDA growth can keep pace (in the aggregate, at least) with what we expect will be punchy growth in net corporate IG debt,\" they said in a December note.\n\nThe average spread for investment-grade bonds dipped to its narrowest level in over two decades right after the election, and has widened only slightly since, according to Ice BofA data cited by the Financial Times.",

            "content": "New Delhi: The National Medical Commission (NMC) is yet to receive the intimation from the Department of Pharmaceutical (DoP) asking it to take action against 30 offending doctors who allegedly took pharma freebies in the form of travel and hospitality expenses from AbbVie Healthcare, a senior NMC official recently informed the Medical Dialogues team.\n\nDoP received a complaint stating that the pharma company AbbVie provided travel tickets and hotel accommodations for extravagant pleasure trips under the guise of conferences (Aesthetics 86 Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress 2024), which took place from February 1 to 3, 2024, and from March 26 to 29, 2024, in Monaco and Paris, respectively, for 30 doctors connected to the medical aesthetics/anti-ageing products (Botox and Juvederm).\n\nThe alleged expenses totaled Rs 1.91 crore, covering flights and hotel stays and the Special Audit Committee of DoP found these allegations to be true. These doctors will now face action from the Commission as per the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 that bar the doctors from accepting pharma freebies.\n\nWhat's the Issue?\n\nMedical Dialogues had earlier reported that DoP had received the anonymous complaint back on May 21, 2024, and while investigating the allegations, the Special Audit Committee, set up by DoP, reported severe branches of UCPMP (Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices).\n\nThe Special Audit Committee found out that \u2018AbbVie was in breach of UCPMP 2014 and UCPMP 2024. The total expenditure for 24 doctors travelling to Paris and 6 doctors to Monaco amounted to INR 1,91,24,991/- (One crore ninety-one lakh twenty-four thousand nine hundred ninety-one rupees only) for travel tickets and hotel accommodations in foreign locations, which was an explicit contravention of the codal provisions.\u2019\n\nBoth the NMC Ethics Regulations 2002 and UCPMP 2014 and the newly introduced UCPMP 2024 strictly prohibit pharmaceutical companies from offering travel and hospitality to healthcare professionals and bar doctors from accepting the same.\n\nAlso Read: Rs 1.91 Crore spent on Doctors Travel: Pharma Company faces UCPMP heat, soon action against 30 doctors\n\nThe findings revealed that AbbVie\u2019s spending on travel and accommodation was a direct violation of the UCPMP guidelines. Moreover, the company\u2019s justification that these trips were intended to enhance doctors\u2019 knowledge about products like Botox and Juvederm was deemed insufficient.\n\nFinding the company guilty, the DoP committee reprimanded AbbVie Healthcare while requesting the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to evaluate the tax liability of M/S. AbbVie Healthcare India Pvt Ltd along with 30 HCPs and take action in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 read with the subordinate circulars issued in this regard.\n\nApart from this, the Committee had also asked NMC to take action against the 30 offending HCPs as per Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.\n\nWhat do MCI 2002 Regulations Say?\n\nDoctors are barred from accepting pharma freebies as per the the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.\n\nThese regulations specify that\n\n\"A medical practitioner shall not accept any travel facility inside the country or outside, including rail, air, ship , cruise tickets, paid vacations etc. from any pharmaceutical or allied healthcare industry or their representatives for self and family members for vacation or for attending conferences, seminars, workshops, CME programme etc as a delegate.\"\n\nWhile the 2002 Ethics Regulations do not specify how the doctors should be punished for violation of the rules, the Apex Medical Commission offered clarification in this regard in the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner RMP (Professional Conduct) Regulations 2023, which were later put on hold.\n\nAs per the 2023 Regulations, doctors accepting any gifts, travel facilities, hospitality, cash or monetary grants, consultancy fee or honorariums, or access to entertainment or recreation from pharmaceutical companies or their representatives, commercial healthcare establishments, medical device companies, or corporate hospitals may face a suspension of the license to practice for a maximum period of three months.\n\nSince the 2023 regulations are on hold, the NMC will decide how these doctors will be punished if they are found guilty of violating the rules.\n\nAlso Read: Pharma-Doctor Interactions: What has changed in the new Code of Medical Ethics? 10 important takeaways",

The market will grow as a result of the following factors: increasing adoption of biologics and biosimilars, growing demand for home healthcare, technological advancements in injection devices, supportive government policies and regulatory approvals, rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and strategic alliances and partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey features such as auto-injectors, wearable devices, needle-free systems, and smart connectivity are becoming increasingly prevalent. These advancements facilitate self-injection as a viable option for even the most complex treatments, thereby encouraging patients to actively engage in managing their healthcare. In February 2023, Phillips-Medisize, a leader in manufacturing diagnostic and MedTech devices, announced the expansion of its product portfolio with the introduction of a disposable pen injector. This new device complements Phillips-Medisize's growing range of products and platforms, which aim to empower biopharma companies. With this innovation, biopharma firms can expedite the rollout of both novel and generic drug treatments, achieving significant economies of scale.\n\n\n\nNorth America is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the well-established healthcare infrastructure, high prevalence of chronic diseases, early adoption of advanced self-injection technologies, and strong presence of key market players. Additionally, Asia Pacific is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapidly expanding healthcare sector, increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses, rising awareness of self-injection options, and growing investments by manufacturers in emerging markets like China and India. For instance, Biogen bought Human Immunology Biosciences (HI-Bio) in July 2024, adding felzartamab, a promising treatment candidate, to their immunology pipeline. Through the acquisition, felzartamab will proceed to Phase 3 trials for several indications. Phase 2 studies for antibody-mediated rejection and IgA nephropathy have shown encouraging preliminary findings.\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive research report focuses on the global and regional market size and forecasts from 2024 to 2035.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\nBase Year: 2024\n\nForecast Period: 2025-2035\n\nStudy Coverage\n\nMarket Forecast by Product, Usability, Application, and Distribution Channel\n\nMarket Forecast for 5 Regions and 17+ Countries North America (U.S. and Canada) Europe (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Russia, Rest of Europe) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, Rest of APAC) Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of LATAM) MEA (South Africa, GCC, Rest of MEA)\n\nExhaustive Company Profiles of the Top 10+ Market Players Antares Pharma, Inc.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals UCB SA SHL Group Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.\n\n20% Free Customization Available to Meet Your Exact Requirements\n\nSelf-injection Devices Market Analysis & Forecast by Product 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nNeedle-free injectors\n\nAutoinjectors\n\nPen injectors\n\nWearable injectors\n\nBy product, the needle-free injector segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global self-injection devices market in 2024 owing to the increased demand for painless, user-friendly alternatives for drug delivery that reduce needle anxiety and the risk of needle-stick injuries. For instance, Astra Therapeutics chose Ypsomed's YpsoMate autoinjector platform in August 2024 for its flagship medication, ATR-101, which is intended to treat patients with severe allergic responses. With the help of Ypsomed's device development experience, this partnership seeks to improve ATR-101 administration and delivery while guaranteeing a dependable and convenient patient experience. Astria Therapeutics aims to enhance treatment results and patient adherence in the management of severe allergies by incorporating Ypsomed's technology, setting itself up for success in the cutthroat therapeutic market. Additionally, the autoinjector segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases and the preference for devices that ensure accurate, easy, and reliable self-administration of medication.\n\nSelf-injection Devices Market Analysis & Forecast by Usability 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nDisposable\n\nReusable\n\nBy usability, the disposable accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global self-injection devices market in 2024 owing to the convenience and hygiene benefits they offer, as well as their single-use design which minimizes the risk of contamination and infection. For instance, MoonLake Immunotherapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to creating cutting-edge treatments for inflammatory disorders, and SHL Medical, a well-known supplier of sophisticated drug delivery solutions, announced their collaboration agreement in May 2023. The partnership uses SHL Medical's Molly autoinjector technology to produce an autoinjector for MoonLake's Nanobody sonelokimab's clinical and possible commercial supply. Additionally, the reusable segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its cost-effectiveness and growing popularity among environmentally conscious users, as these devices generate less medical waste over time.\n\nSelf-injection Devices Market Analysis & Forecast by Application 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nCancer\n\nAutoimmune disorders\n\nHormonal disorders\n\nPain management\n\nOthers\n\nBy application, cancer accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global self-injection devices market in 2024 owing to the increasing use of self-injection therapies for cancer patients, including hormone therapies and supportive care medications, which reduce the need for frequent hospital visits. For instance, the FDA gave Enable Injections permission to give Empaveli using their enFuse injector in October 2023. Empaveli, a drug intended to treat adult paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), is marketed by Apellis Pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the pain management segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its widespread use for chronic pain conditions that require regular self-administration, such as arthritis and musculoskeletal pain, enhancing patient convenience and adherence.\n\nSelf-injection Devices Market Analysis & Forecast by Distribution Channel 2024 - 2035 (Revenue USD Bn)\n\nHospital Pharmacies\n\nRetail Pharmacies\n\nOnline Pharmacies\n\nBy distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global self-injection devices market in 2024 owing to the trust and accessibility associated with hospital pharmacies, where patients often obtain their devices following doctor consultations. For instance, Aptar Digital Health teamed up with SHL Medical in June 2024 to integrate its SaMD platform and improve linked device technology. The goal of this partnership was to enhance the patient experience when administering injectable treatments on their own, promoting improved patient adherence and illness management. Additionally, the online pharmacies segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to its convenience, competitive pricing, and the rise in telemedicine which enables patients to order medical supplies and devices directly to their homes.\n\nKey Attributes\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2023-2034 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2023 $22.82 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2034 $67.29 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 10.3% Regions Covered Global\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/sod4pj\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

            "content": "The Apex Committee for Pharma Marketing Practices, under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, recently found pharmaceutical company AbbVie Healthcare India Private Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based AbbVie Inc,. guilty of sponsoring international trips to the tune of nearly \u20b91.91 crore for 30 doctors, a breach of the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP), 2024.\n\nThe case came to light based on an anonymous complaint accompanied by documents supporting the claims concerning unethical marketing practices, where doctors were offered the freebie for \u2018professional development\u2019. The tip-off gave details about the travel tickets and hotel accommodation offered to doctors under the guise of a conference (The Aesthetic and Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress 2024) in Monaco and Paris, said the Union Health Ministry.\n\nSo what do the rules in India say about pharmaceutical companies offering \u201cgifts\u2019\u201d to doctors?\n\nThe rules\n\nBoth the UCPMP 2014, and now 2024 version, clearly forbid pharmaceutical companies from offering travel and hospitality to any healthcare professionals.\n\nThe UCPMP was brought in last year by the Health Ministry, in a bit to promote transparency and ethical conduct within the pharmaceutical sector. On March 12, 2024, the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) issued a policy communication to all pharmaceutical associations, enclosing the UCPMP 2024. .\n\nThe UCPMP 2024 is a framework that regulates how pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies interact with healthcare professionals (HCPs) in India. It aims to prevent undue influence on prescription practices, ensure fair practices, and protect public health.\n\nThe Code prohibits companies from offering gifts, benefits, or pecuniary advantages to HCPs or their family members. It also restricts companies from offering travel facilities or hospitality to HCPs, unless under specified programmes.\n\nThe UCPMP 2024, however, allows companies to offer informational and educational brand reminders, as well as free samples, subject to certain conditions. The UCPMP 2024 replaced the UCPMP 2014. It applies to both pharmaceutical and medical device companies.\n\nWhat is the doctor-pharma company relationship in India?\n\nAn article, \u2018The pharmaceutical company\u2013healthcare relationship: much ado about something\u2019, published recently in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, notes that the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and the healthcare profession, especially doctors, has always been fraught with conflicts of interest (COI). Personal, intellectual, financial or commercial COI can affect one\u2019s judgement and actions, sometimes even inadvertently, it notes.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence to suggest that financial \u201cgifts\u201d, however they may be packaged, can influence a doctor\u2019s prescribing practice. Despite popular thinking, there is no \u201cdose\u2013response\u201d \u2014 no direct link between the \u201csize\u201d of the financial gift and the degree of influence. Even a \u201csmall\u201d gift can create a \u201cnetwork of obligation\u201d as doctors are also social beings, affected by the \u201crules of social reciprocity\u201d. This is why it is critical that doctors become self-reflective and aware of this risk of bias, so that they can actively counteract it themselves, and encourage their academic peers to do so too,\u2019\u2019 points out the article.\n\n\u2018Acceptable industry practice\u2019\n\nIn the AbbVie Healthcare India Private Ltd case, the company attempted to justify its breach as an \u2018acceptable industry practice\u2019. The company added that it had entered into a professional service agreement with these doctors to compensate them for their services. Following this, the company also rejected the option for remedial action where it was asked to provide support to underprivileged patients in government hospitals for an amount equivalent to the violations computed by the special audit team.\n\nThe company was subsequently reprimanded for unethical marketing practices and the Central Board of Direct Taxes has been asked to evaluate the tax liability of the company along with that of the 30 doctors and act in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Additionally, the National Medical Council has also been asked to act against the 30 doctors as per the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.\n\nNeed for strong implementation\n\nExperts point out that a strict implementation of the code and penalising of violators is essential to keep conflicts of interest at bay, and nurture trust in the medical community.\n\nIndia\u2019s pharmaceutical industry is a global leader, with a strong domestic market and a reputation for low prices and high quality. The national pharmaceutical industry is the world\u2019s third largest by volume and fourteenth largest by value. In 2021, the domestic market was valued at USD 42 billion, and is expected to reach USD 120\u2013130 billion by 2030. India is the world\u2019s largest supplier of generic drugs by volume, and exports to over 200 countries and territories. In 2022\u201323, India\u2019s pharmaceutical exports revenue was USD 25.3 billion.",

            "content": "The drug and biotech industry had a tough time in the past couple of months after Trump announced the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, as the head of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the FDA. This, coupled with disappointing third-quarter sales and profits, guidance cuts, and pipeline setbacks took a toll on the overall drug and biotech industry\u2019s performance. However, the industry is expected to recover in 2025.\n\n\n\nInnovation is at its peak for the industry, with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. R&D innovation is likely to remain a major focus area in 2025 as well. M&A activity is also expected to remain strong, particularly with Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\n\n\nRegular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and macroeconomic pressure are some of the headwinds for the sector. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, which makes them safe havens for investments.\n\n\n\nAmong the large drugmakers, Eli Lilly LLY, J&J JNJ, AbbVie ABBV, AstraZeneca AZN and Pfizer PFE are worth retaining in one\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that developmulti-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products. These players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drug companies.\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry?\n\nInnovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, an innovative pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spend a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&D. Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas, and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on huge piles of cash, regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Also, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers. Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Of late, areas like obesity and inflammatory bowel disease are attracting buyout interest. Some of the larger M&A deals of 2024 were Eli Lilly\u2019s buyout of Morphic, Vertex\u2019s buyout of Alpine Immune Sciences and Novo Nordisk\u2019s acquisition of Catalent. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant in 2025.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world and their impact on global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty have increased broader economic woes.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Dim Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #146, which places it in the bottom 41% of 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector but significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively declined 1.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Medical Sector\u2019s decrease of 6.1% in the said time frame. In contrast, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has risen 26.2%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 18.64X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 25.08X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 25.47X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.70X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 15.31X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nJ&J: Its biggest strength is its diversified business model. J&J\u2019s Innovative Medicines segment is showing a growth trend. J&J\u2019s outlook for 2025 looks positive. In 2025, the company expects sales in its Innovative Medicine unit to be more than its guidance of $57 billion. In its Innovative Medicine segment, growth is expected to be driven by its key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada and others, as well as new drugs and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant.\n\nSales in J&J\u2019s MedTech unit slowed in 2024 on continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. Sales in China are being hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement program and the anti-corruption campaign. However, in 2025, in MedTech, J&J expects operational sales growth to be at the upper end of its long-term (2022-2027) guided range of 5-7%, driven by the launch of new products and contributions from Abiomed and Shockwave acquisitions.\n\nThe company also has an interesting R&D pipeline that can generate innovative products and drive its growth further. Importantly, the visibility of potential resolutions to talc lawsuits has improved.\n\nJ&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $10.54 to $10.55 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 10.2% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: JNJ\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. Its position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in December 2023. After a couple of tough years, it seems that Pfizer\u2019s worst slowdown is over now, and the company is gradually making a comeback. Though COVID revenues are declining, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenues improved in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches like Abrysvo, newly acquired products from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. Pfizer also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products will face patent expirations. However, Pfizer\u2019s new products/late-stage pipeline candidates and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen, position it strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAlso, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $5.5 billion. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has remained stable at $2.92 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 10.8% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nAbbVie: Sales of AbbVie\u2019s blockbuster drug, Humira, are declining due to loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals for new indications.\n\nStrong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company\u2019s top line in 2025. However, AbbVie is seeing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China, which will be a headwind in 2025.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade.\n\nAbbVie has also been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline. It has signed several M&A deals in the immunology space, its core area, while also signing some early-stage deals in oncology and neuroscience areas.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nIn the past year, the stock has risen 10.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.17 to $12.27 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nEli Lilly: It has seen stupendous success with its tirzepatide medicines, Mounjaro for type II diabetesand Zepbound for obesity. Despite a short time on the market, Mounjaro and Zepbound became key top-line drivers for Lilly in 2024, with demand rising rapidly. Though demand for the two drugs remains massive, Mounjaro and Zepbound\u2019s sales were hurt due to inventory issues in the third quarter. This led the shares of the company to drop after third-quarter results following a powerful first-half performance.\n\nNonetheless, the company is balancing the demand and supply of Mounjaro and Zepbound and the launch of the drugs in international markets. Lilly\u2019s efforts to increase demand activities for Mounjaro and Zepbound in the fourth quarter should benefit sales in 2025. The launch of Mounjaro in new international markets is expected to contribute to the drug\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter and in 2025.\n\nLilly\u2019s revenue growth is expected to continue to be driven by higher demand for Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and others, making up for the decline in sales from Trulicity. Other new drugs like Omvoh for ulcerative colitis, Jaypirca for mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Kisunla (donanemab) for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease should support Lilly\u2019s top-line growth in 2025. Also, Lilly looks well placed to get approval for several new drugs and label expansions for marketed drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, in the next few years.\n\nLilly is a #3 Ranked stock. Estimates for Lilly\u2019s 2025 earnings have risen from $23.78 to $24.05 per share over the past 60 days. Lilly\u2019s stock has risen 25% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: LLY\n\nAstraZeneca: It boasts a diversified geographical footprint as well as a product portfolio with several blockbuster medicines. AstraZeneca now has 12 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio, with sales exceeding $1 billion, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Soliris and Ultomiris. These drugs are driving the company\u2019s top line with AstraZeneca launching them in more markets and an increased number of indications.\n\nAstraZeneca has been making significant progress with its pipeline in areas like oncology, cardiovascular health, immunology and rare diseases. In 2024, it acquired small biotechs like Gracell, Fusion Pharmaceuticals and Amolyt to strengthen its pipeline.\n\nBacked by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. AstraZeneca expects to generate$80 billion in total revenues by 2030. By the said time frame, AstraZeneca plans to launch 20 new medicines, with six new medicines already launched. It believes that many of these new medicines will have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in peak-year revenues. The company is also on target to achieve a mid-30s percentage core operating margin by 2026.\n\nAstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AstraZeneca\u2019s 2025 EPS has remained stable at $4.69 over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 4.1% in the past year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: AZN\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "This transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nKathrin LaFaver, MD: Hi, and welcome, on behalf of Medscape. I am Dr Kathrin LaFaver, a neurologist in Saratoga Springs. We'll be talking today about the topic of direct-care neurology.\n\nI have with me our wonderful guests, Dr Jill Farmer, who is CEO and director of Boro Neurology, a practice in Hopewell, New Jersey; as well as Dr Jennifer Werely, who's a neurologist and medical officer of Neurology and Headache Center of Greenwich in Connecticut. Welcome and thanks for joining.\n\nJill M. Giordano Farmer, DO, MPH: Thanks.\n\nJennifer C. Werely, MD: Thanks for having us.\n\nConcierge Care vs Fee-for-Service\n\nLaFaver: Maybe we should start off with some definitions. Some people might have heard of direct-care primary care offices, which have really been on the rise in the past decade, I would say. Some people are maybe familiar with the term \"concierge medicine.\" I'd like to get both of your perspectives on what we're actually talking about. Jill, do you want to go first?\n\nFarmer: Sure. For me, direct specialty care is just that. There is no middleman between me and my patient. It means that they have direct access to me and I have direct access to them without the gatekeeper of insurance.\n\nIt is basically, in my practice, fee-for-service. It's not concierge; they don't have to join my practice, pay a fee, or anything like that. They see me for an office visit, they'll get an invoice, and then they will submit it when they are able. Not everyone is able to submit an invoice.\n\nLaFaver: Jen, how would you define direct-care neurology?\n\nWerely: I would agree. My practice setup is similar to Jill's where, rather than have a large fee, the concierge fee, where you get care when and any time you need it, the framework of my practice is also fee-for-service.\n\nLike Jill, at each visit, patients get a statement, and if they have out-of-network benefits or whatnot, they can submit it depending on their insurance plan.\n\nLaFaver: I would say, probably 20 years ago, most physicians were working out of their own practice and in an insurance-based model. I think we've seen a huge shift, with big hospital systems over the years employing more and more physicians to the point that most neurologists in the US are employees.\n\nOf course, physician burnout is at an all-time high. Many of the reasons have to do with increasing administrative burdens, and so much paperwork, and things to do with the interactions with the electronic medical record system rather than just spending time with our patients, which is what we set out to do as physicians.\n\nI'd love to hear from both of you about what in your career trajectory really motivated you to make that switch. Jennifer, do you want to go first this time?\n\nFewer Patients, More Time, No RVUs\n\nWerely: I've had this structure for my practice for about 8 years. Just to compare and contrast a bit, I have more time with patients, so I have less volume, which is nice. When I was in the insurance-based model, I was seeing probably double the number of patients that I do today and not having as much time to spend with those particular patients, which then meant more frequent visits. Often, patients would have to follow up in 6 or 8 weeks, which is sooner than they would with the structure I have today.\n\nIt's very helpful to have that direct access. There's no one answering calls for me, no nursing staff. I'm in control of everything. I like that. I like to know what's going on with people and when changes are made, which I wasn't so on top of in the insurance-based model, just because those tasks are often farmed out to other people. Until you follow up with a patient, you may be unaware if anything has changed in their care.\n\nFor me, it's the amount of time I can spend with patients, not having to deal within the framework of a system, being in more control over my life and my schedule \u2014 not just my needs, but my family's needs, which in other models is certainly not prioritized. It's more the needs of the practice. It's allowed me flexibility where I can work as much or as little as I'd like, but it also provides comprehensive care to people where, if anything comes up, they let me know and we can deal with it right away.\n\nConversations I've had with doctors over the years show that they just feel less valued in big systems. They don't have control over anything. Their RVUs change, their compensation structures change almost as if they're in sales now, where you reach a target and now it gets more difficult, and you have to see more patients and you have less time.\n\nI think that's why you see a large amount of physician turnover. Where it used to be that folks would be in a practice and be there long term, it's really not the case anymore. Doctors are changing jobs much more frequently. Having control can be priceless, and that really is what motivated me to shift from the insurance-based model.\n\nLaFaver: Jill, how did it look for you?\n\nFarmer: I'm glad Jen went first because Jen was a big motivator for me to take this leap and do it, since her practice has been so successful. What resonates with me, from the very beginning \u2014 it was about a two, maybe two-plus\u2012year process for me to make this transition \u2014 she kept saying, \"It's so easy.\"\n\nPeople make it sound like it's so difficult, but it's really so easy to do this, particularly when you opt out of participating with insurance, and that is entirely true.\n\nI had been one of those people who had some longevity. I was with the same practice for a little over 10 years. I had a very good working relationship with my colleagues and with administrators of the practice. It wasn't malignant; I didn't need to leave because I wasn't feeling valued or things like that.\n\nFor us, it was just the landscape and the context of how medicine is being practiced in New Jersey and Northeast Pennsylvania, where we were first hospital based, then academic based, and then we were a large subspecialty private.\n\nThrough each of those different practice models, I was losing more and more resources. When I initially started out in the hospital-based model, I had a multidisciplinary team, I had a large amount of administrative support, and I had a social worker. It was really the goal of what I would like a comprehensive clinic to look like.\n\nAs I moved from place to place, because of resources, COVID-19, and everything else, things started to get stripped away. I no longer had a social worker. I no longer had the access to the multidisciplinary team. Priorities were shifting, as you were saying with sales, like shifting patients over toward surgical interventions as opposed to medical interventions, even though our medical interventions were getting better.\n\nI had kept my practice afloat through these three different model changes with the same patient base that I had, and at this point I had gathered enough clinical goodwill and clinical acumen with my patients that I felt I could do this on my own. I was now doing so much more myself anyway that I might as well be doing it for myself.\n\nHome Visits and Cost Transparency\n\nLaFaver: Maybe you could speak a little bit to some of the advantages for patients. There are upfront costs that they wouldn't have to pay otherwise with insurance-based models. What are they getting that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten?\n\nJill, you offer, for example, home visits, so I'd love to hear more about that.\n\nFarmer: One of the things that I was looking to do when I transitioned was, obviously, to have my own space. It's been in renovation for 18 months. My husband's doing the renovation and we're working as quickly as we can. I ended up transitioning from my other practice before my office space was done, which was a happy accident because that meant that I started incorporating home visits into my practice.\n\nThat's something that, again, would not really be easily accomplished through an institution-based model, whether it's academic, hospital based, or whatever, because of the restrictions, rules, and regulations of what their liability is, what they're comfortable with doing. If you offer it for one, you have to offer it for all. You can't work outside your own box.\n\nThe home visits have been phenomenal. Patients are incredibly appreciative. They all ask whether, when my office is ready, I will still be doing home visits. I will, because it's been reinvigorating for me in the practice of medicine. It's been enjoyable to see patients in their own environment, and to have it be conversational and casual, but still incredibly informative and being able to provide the care that we need.\n\nI should also mention that I'm a movement disorder specialist. I deal primarily with Parkinson's disease, so much of our exam and our time spent with patients is history-taking conversation \u2014 with a physical exam, of course \u2014 but I don't need any equipment or anything else. It lends itself to a home visit very nicely. That won't work for everybody.\n\nLaFaver: Jen, do you have anything to add in terms of what patients really get out of this, in addition to the time aspect?\n\nWerely: Absolutely. Jill, that's great. Home visits. I do them, but infrequently. I think, particularly in movement, it's good to see people in their home and see what space they're navigating. That's a huge benefit, absolutely, for that patient population.\n\nThe only way to explain it is the value of time. What's lost in medicine is time, and people think it's this big cost. I went to physical therapy for 45 minutes. They billed out to my insurance $1700 for one session. I'm still upset about it. Because of my deductible, a large percentage is falling upon me. Had I known that up front, I never would have gone for five sessions, which is now going to cost me thousands of dollars with an in-network provider.\n\nWith my practice, you know what the cost is up front. I can be flexible with it if needed. I try to be very reasonable and bill out less than what practices bill out to insurance policies. Although the cost up front may seem different, in many ways it can be a cost-savings long term because it saves you time. You don't have to come to my office as much. We can answer most of your questions by a phone call or an email. If you have one office visit a year, I can prescribe for you all year. I can think about things as they come up.\n\nWhen I was insurance based, I had so many patients and I was so booked out that it was impossible to navigate every nuance of new problems, whereas in this particular model, because my volume is controlled, I just have more time. I think that time can be priceless when it comes to someone's medical care.\n\nLaFaver: I love that. I think that transparency aspect is so true. Even for us as physicians, we usually don't know what kind of bill patients will get for our services. It can be very difficult to navigate as we have often learned, being in patients' shoes ourselves. That's a really great argument.\n\nFarmer: I was just going to add to that. I actually came from a home visit this morning before doing this interview, and the woman I saw was so appreciative that when she called the office, I called her back. She was floored by that, that the doctor was giving her a call back. I said, well, that's exactly it.\n\nTo Jen's point, because I have a smaller patient population, I will be able to handle the calls that come in. You'll speak with me. There will be no buffer or barrier in between. Patients, I think, are incredibly relieved when they hear that because they get so turned around in the larger systems with the phone trees and the 14 hurdles that patients go through to get answers.\n\nOnce you explain to them, like we were saying about the upfront costs, that I have more time to deal with questions and triage things in between visits. I'm not looking to see you more. I'm really looking, at least in the movement world, to see patients maybe three times a year.\n\nWhen you add up what that total would be for a year, over 12 months with the access in between, and they understand that it's just the office visit \u2014 all of their medications, all of their referrals, any testing that's ordered is still covered by insurance \u2014 it doesn't seem so financially daunting.\n\nAdvice on Starting a Direct-Care Practice\n\nLaFaver: Before we close, what advice do you have for other physicians and maybe neurologists, specifically, interested in learning more about that business model or possibly considering that as an option? Are there any resources or other tips and tricks you can guide people to?\n\nWerely: I didn't have any resources. I started from the ground up on my own, but people are welcome to reach out to me. It is actually an easy process. It does feel overwhelming, but you keep your overhead low and you keep your systems very simple. It's so much easier than these systems and such.\n\nStarting a medical practice that's outside the insurance world, your needs are very basic, particularly because generally neurologists aren't doing procedures. We don't need hospital privileges. We don't have to cover stroke. What I suggest to people is that if you have an established practice in a geographic area, you may have some limitations about where you can go or for how long you can't practice.\n\nLet's say it's a year in your contract where you can't practice near where you're currently practicing or within a certain radius. Then you have a year to set things up if, financially, that is something you can swing.\n\nI didn't have many resources so I don't know what's out there, but I'm happy to help people. I've tried to put a service on my website so that if people need guidance, I can help collaborate.\n\nLaFaver: Wonderful. Thank you for that. I know, Jill, you have learned from Jennifer, but I also know there are definitely resources out there geared more toward the primary care space. I was curious if that has been helpful to you or if there are any other thoughts you want to share with people.\n\nFarmer: Jen is selling herself short. She is a wealth of knowledge, and it was not just helpful with the encouragement, but also with the practical pointers of what the basics are that you need to set up a practice. You need an electronic medical record, you need the ability to prescribe, and if you're going to have physical space, you need to set that up.\n\nYou can do all of this from your phone at this point. There is no need to have a large, integrated system. I have a Google workspace and my medical record is a therapist medical record because it already had telemedicine capabilities built into it.\n\nWhat is marketed toward physicians specifically, you will see, it's like planning a party and saying it's a 50th anniversary vs a wedding. Once you say \"wedding,\" everything gets marked up 1000%. If instead you say, \"I need a medical record for any sort of provider,\" it's the same idea.\n\nOnce you go into the physician world, that gets jacked up 1000%. You need your liability, you need coverage. So you need your malpractice, your HIPAA compliance, and all of that. The range of costs was $750 to $17,000 for HIPAA compliance. If you're just a single person doing your thing, you don't need the $17,000 one. The $750 option works just fine to keep a binder on yourself where you can check a box to say \"I'm compliant.\"\n\nIt takes a little bit of shopping around. There are many resources that are available for primary care. Much of it translates into specialty care. You don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, but there are plenty of ways to do it very economically.\n\nLaFaver: Wonderful. It sounds like the time is ripe for a neurology practice startup guide from the two of you. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful wealth of knowledge and experience. I'm very curious to see where this field is going as more and more physicians are looking for more autonomy over their time, their practice, and the way they want to practice medicine.\n\nYou both are pioneers. Thank you both for sharing your time.",

            "content": "Research and development jobs are a priority for biopharmas, according to a recent BioSpace workforce planning survey where 60% of respondents said they anticipate hiring in R&D in 2025. Some also called out the oncology space as an area of high demand\u2014but which oncology R&D roles are companies looking to fill? Computational biology and data science are hot areas for hiring, according to an industry talent acquisition executive.\n\nThere\u2019s a demand for more computationally focused behind-the-computer type roles, said Conor Sullivan, associate director and head of talent acquisition at Harbinger Health, a Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech that develops technologies for cancer screening and detection. The company uses artificial intelligence to help identify cancer before it\u2019s visible or symptomatic with the goal of developing low-cost, multicancer blood tests.\n\nIn the recent BioSpace survey, respondents supported Sullivan\u2019s observation about behind-the-computer roles, noting that structured query language, Python and AI are among the R&D skills they expect to be in high demand in 2025.\n\nSullivan told BioSpace that Harbinger has most recently focused on computational biology and data science roles that border on machine learning. He said the jobs involve having a good, broad base of knowledge that allows employees to leverage more off-the-shelf tooling to expand their ability to analyze data.\n\nMultiple companies have computational biology and data science roles in the oncology space posted on the BioSpace website. Examples of recent computational biology positions include senior principal scientist, computational biology at Amgen and vice president, translational data science/computational biology at Recursion. Examples of recent data science roles include principal data scientist at AbbVie and vice president, global business digital insights and analytics-oncology at Takeda.\n\nComputational Biology, Data Science Markets Projected to Grow\n\nThe importance of computational biology and data science is reflected in their growing market values. The global computational biology market is estimated to increase from $6.6 billion in 2023 to over $20.5 billion by 2030, according to Coherent Market Insights. The global market intelligence and consulting organization attributes that growth to biopharma companies\u2019 growing demand for predictive modeling and noted that pharmas use computational biology techniques for drug discovery and development.\n\nThe global data science platform market is estimated to increase from $11 billion in 2024 to $45.9 billion in 2031, according to Coherent. The organization attributes that growth to widespread adoption of data-driven decision making across various industries. Coherent also noted that increasing focus on generating insights from structured and unstructured data to gain a competitive advantage can boost demand for data science platforms.\n\nAll of this is not to say that lab-based R&D roles in oncology are not in demand. For example, Sullivan noted that at Harbinger, there\u2019s a significant need for biopharma professionals who know the cell biology behind the genesis of cancer so they understand what\u2019s happening at the earliest formations of the disease. He said the company\u2019s lab-based employees usually have a molecular biology background.\n\nKey Hard and Soft Skills: From Sequencing to Communication\n\nFor data science and computational biology roles, Sullivan said Harbinger looks for biopharma professionals who understand the epigenetic and methylation changes that occur in genomic data where cancer is present. The company also wants people who understand how to translate those changes into biomarkers that enable them to not only understand different types of cancer but also track how they progress. Sullivan said sequencing is a big focus in terms of skill sets.\n\nCompanies that have posted computational biology jobs on BioSpace, such as Amgen and Recursion, have noted interest in technical skills such as expertise in bioinformatics; experience with programming languages such as R and Python; and knowledge of platforms and readouts used to assess clinical biomarkers, including flow cytometry, immunoassays and single-cell assays.\n\nBiopharmas that have listed data science positions on BioSpace, such as AbbVie and Amgen, have requested qualifications including demonstrated analytical skills; experience in physicochemical or analytical characterization of biological molecules; and experience developing and implementing patient stratification/precision medicine solutions in clinical development, leveraging multi-omics and clinical data.\n\nSoft skills are also sought after. For example, a recent Amgen job posting for a computational biology role listed strong written and oral communication skills, self-motivation, independence and leadership as preferred qualifications. Sullivan noted that communication, organization and collaboration are important to Harbinger and especially to smaller companies.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily we look for the best oncologist in the world, and they need to have these communication skills,\u201d he said, adding that striking a balance between hard and soft skills is helpful. \u201cI would say in any small company\u2014100 or less, or even 200 or less\u2014being comfortable, confident and wanting to have that collaboration and communication is really beneficial to not only your career but the overall company and team that you\u2019re working with.\u201d\n\nAdvice for Early-Stage Job Candidates\n\nWhen it comes to advice for job candidates applying for data science and computational biology roles, Sullivan focused on grad school students looking to develop skills that will be applicable for industry. He recommended learning Python, for example. Sullivan also advised that grad students work with computational biologists at school to understand how to analyze and leverage data to accelerate projects.\n\n\u201cIn thinking that way, what you\u2019re really doing is you\u2019re being proactive about what other technologies exist, and how can I utilize those things to further my goal, my project, my scientific team,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf you\u2019re taking that proactive approach, then thinking about what the emergent technologies are, looking at what industry is focusing on in some of those job descriptions and trying to partner with and reach out to groups or individuals that have those skill sets will really set you apart.\u201d",

            "content": "Will 2025 see a more vigilant government when it comes to violations by pharma companies, be it GMP slip ups or the Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practices (UCPMP)?\n\nFor instance, time is running out for MSME pharma companies, as we pass the December 31 deadline to comply with the revised Schedule M of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.\n\nWhile this segment of pharma companies, a turnover of less than Rs. 250 crore, was given an extra six months to comply with these revised rules, industry insiders comment that even most larger companies have not yet fully complied with all requirements of the revised guidelines.\n\nMultiple industry associations representing MSME pharma have approached the authorities to extend the deadline for them to complete upgrading their facilities but so far there has been no response. The word is that the government will have no choice but to extend the deadline to avoid the shuttering of non-compliant factories which might lead to shortages. The ensuing job losses and dip in state revenues will also play a role in this decision.\n\nSources also indicate that the regulatory authority government too needs more time as there are many drug inspector posts still vacant. This clearly means that even if there is no extension of the December 31 deadline, it would be some time before inspections can be rolled out. This lacuna was highlighted during the ongoing parliamentary session, when the fifth report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers presented to the Lok Sabha during this session, mentioned that as of last December, almost 60 per cent of the sanctioned strength of drug inspectors, which is 303 out of the total 504 posts, were vacant.\n\nThe Committee has urged the centre to fill up these vacancies on priority as well as assess the need to sanction more posts, considering that the country has more than 750 districts. The fifth report cited the need \u201cto ensure effective regulation and oversight owing to the multifaceted issues grappling the spurious/NSQ drugs\u201d, noting that \u201cas on date only 5.9 per cent (only 35 convictions) of the total 593 cases relating to spurious/adulterated drugs have been resolved, with the remaining cases at various stages in respective courts.\u201d While there have been reports of plans to recruit 250 drug inspectors, the health ministry clearly needs more time.\n\nSecondly, consider the Department of Pharmaceuticals\u2019 action on an anonymous complaint that AbbVie Healthcare India had violated the Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practices (UCPMP).\n\nAccording to the December 23, 2024 order of the Apex Committee for Pharma Marketing Practices of the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers Department of Pharmaceuticals, the complaint provided proof that the company \u2018provided travel tickets and hotel accommodations for extravagant pleasure trips under the guise of conferences\u2019 (Aesthetics & Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress 2024), which took place from February 1 to 3, 2024, and from March 26 to 29, 2024, in Monaco and Paris, respectively, for 30 doctors connected to the medical aesthetics/ anti-ageing products (Botox and Juvederm).\n\nAfter audits and hearings, the DoP has asked for the reprimand to be posted on the pharma company\u2019s website and will be evaluating the tax liability of AbbVie Healthcare India along with 30 HCPs and take action in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Thirdly, the Apex Commitee has requested the National Medical Council (NMC) to take action against the 30 offending HCPs as per Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.\n\nThe government\u2019s tough stance on UCPMP, possible GMP inspections and the upcoming Union Budget will see pharma companies hoping to influence DoP officials. For example, industry lobby groups reportedly met government officials to give their suggestions on guidelines for over the counter (OTC) medicines. The government is reportedly mulling a list of medicines which can safely make the switch from prescription (Rx) to OTC. Though these medicines are already freely available without prescriptions in most pharmacies, the official Rx to OTC switch will allow them to be sold in groceries stores as well. Online pharmacies too will benefit from more Rx medicines the switching to OTC.\n\nWhile the Rx to OTC switch will improve access, there is already rampant use of many such medicines. The lack of awareness on the potential overuse and misuse of OTC medicines, thanks to low literacy levels and multiple languages in India, is a serious concern. Can government officials ensure that while making the Rx to OTC switch, there are adequate awareness campaigns, highlighting the proper use of such medicines to prevent misuse?\n\nWill the ruling in the AbbVie Healthcare India case prevent future violations of the UCPMP? Is the government looking to set a similar example on the implementation of the revised Schedule M and updated GMP standards? Will this stance slowly restore public trust in pharma companies, as well as the DoP which has been accused of being more industry friendly than patient-centric? 2025 could thus be a pivotal year for course corrections for all stakeholders.\n\nVIVEKA ROYCHOWDHURY, Editor\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]",

It\u2019s also a place where human need is high, with food, shelter, and health services in demand among those in the community and recent arrivals.\n\nStepping into that gap is the Health Outreach Prevention and Education, or HOPE+, a collaborative program, run by The University of Texas, El Paso, College of Health Sciences, Department of Social Work and College of Nursing. The program includes 85 organizations that provide a variety of services, including healthcare, food, housing referrals for people who are unhoused, access to public health department programs, community health workers support for navigating services, and more. The organization also hosts health fairs to connect vulnerable populations to vital care while addressing health disparities in El Paso County.\n\nIn 2024, the program reached over 1,600 people, offering on-site services and referrals to safety-net services that can improve their health. The program also involves university students training in health fields so they can gain experience with patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re adding a dimension of humility and exposure so that the next generation of professionals are better equipped to refer to the individual who is marginalized as an individual who is worthy of dignity and respect,\u201d said Moya.\n\nA $200,000 grant from Direct Relief\u2019s Fund for Health Equity, made possible with support from the AbbVie Foundation, allowed the University of Texas at El Paso School of Social Work to expand the HOPE health fairs to unsheltered and uninsured people across El Paso and beyond.\n\nSince 2021, Direct Relief, through its Fund for Health Equity, has granted more than $50 million to 163 organizations across the U.S.\n\nThis video was directed, produced, and edited by Oliver Riley-Smith Cinematography.",

Under the outgoing DoP chief, UCPMP 2024 had (in December) issued its first order, just days ago, involving an alleged violation by Abbvie Healthcare India.\n\nThe order found the company in breach of the pharma ethics code by sponsoring foreign vacations (Monaco and Paris) for about 30 healthcare practitioners. Abbvie and an industry platform interpret the company\u2019s action differently \u2013 and 2025 will see more discussion to iron out interpretation and implementation of UCPMP.\n\nAlso read Sun Pharma sells entire stake in step-down subsidiary in Japan\n\nTrump policies\n\nGlobally, more flanks of strife and geo-political uncertainty have opened up, including Bangladesh. This, even as a key export market - the US, gets a new president in Donald Trump. His policies on \u201cAmerica First\u201d, drug-pricing, intellectual property (IP) and his picks to head healthcare and the regulatory Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could impact Indian drugmakers.\n\nAnother key US development is the Biosecure Act. Earlier in December, it had not been included in a key Defence Bill \u2013 despite having bi-partisan support. And this shift is a challenge, said industry-insiders. The BioSecure Act looked to restrict collaborations with certain Chinese companies \u2013 opening up opportunities for Indian drugmakers, among others.\n\nSujay Shetty, PwC\u2019s Global Health Industries Advisory Leader, says the upcoming year will be interesting for two key reasons \u2013 changing US dynamics and the opportunity from GLP-1 drugs (diabetes and weightloss drugs).\n\nThe US is the single most important market for the top 20 Indian drugmakers, says Shetty, pointing to implications following possible policy changes from President-elect Trump involving localisation. The BioSecure Act will bring in opportunities, he adds, as companies look to derisk and bolster supplychains. He also points to the opportunity of GLP-1 drugs in the coming years, as obesity increasingly becomes a health concern. (The GLP-1 segment has been made \u201cpopular\u201d by diabetes and weight-loss drugs - semaglutide (Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic / Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro).\n\nAnd as the generic drugs opportunity comes under pressure, companies will be in the quest for opportunities in devices and biosimilars, adds Shetty. Targeted acquisitions to get into a geography or therapy, will continue, he said. Last year saw the acquisition of Bharat Serums and Vaccines by Mankind Pharma for \u20b913,630 crore. In fact, 2024 saw the pharma industry perform reasonably well, he points out.\n\nHealth security\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry plays a critical role in the country\u2019s health security. And towards this, Government efforts are underway to support manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), development of novel antibiotics (nafithromycin), and medical devices; besides expanding its Janaushadhi retail stores for less expensive medicines.\n\nWhile there is cheer over the production of Penicillin G, after 30-odd years, domestic drug and device makers will be looking to up their game through innovating, to cater to local needs and global supplies, while keeping it affordable. Quality will be the other key concern that drugmakers will need to keep front and centre.\n\nIn fact, the focus in 2025 for the pharma/ vaccines and medical devices industry will be to ensure sustained supplies to meet local and overseas requirements, with a stronger commitment on quality.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit",

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation.\n\nImproved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024.\n\nDividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019\u2014a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates\u2014dividends contributed 75% to the market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nInvestors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company\u2019s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not.\n\nReflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers.\n\nStory Continues",

This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 13.8.\n\nIt is also worth noting that ABBV currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.45 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector.

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term.\n\nAlso read:\n\n8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nHistorically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market\u2019s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nAccording to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nThis resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks.

(NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nInnovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nIn addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most.

            "content": "New Delhi: The Department of Pharmaceutical (DoP) has asked the National Medical Commission (NMC) to act against 30 healthcare professionals connected to medical aesthetics and anti-ageing products (Botox and Juvederm) for violating Indian Medical Council (Professional, Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.\n\nUnder the regulations, a medical practitioner shall not accept any travel facility inside the country or outside, including rail, air, ship, cruise tickets, paid vacations etc. from any pharmaceutical or allied healthcare industry or their representatives for self and family members for vacationing or for attending conferences, seminars, workshops, CME programme etc as a delegate.\n\nAn audit by the department found that healthcare professionals received extravagant pleasure trips in Monaco and Paris from M/s AbbVie Healthcare India Private Ltd.\n\nAn anonymous complaint was received by the department in May accompanied by documents supporting the claims, concerning unethical marketing practices related to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s subsidiary AbbVie Healthcare India Private Ltd (AbbVie), alleging a breach of the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP).\n\nThe complaint outlined that AbbVie provided travel tickets and hotel accommodation under the guise of conferences (Aesthetics and Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress 2024) which took place from February 1 to 3, 2024 and from March 26-29, 2024 in Monaco and Paris for 30 doctors connected to the medical aesthetics and anti-ageing products.\n\nDespite the anonymity of the complaint, the allegations against the company were serious and explicitly contravened the schema of the UCPMP. The department forwarded the complaint to the Ethics Committee For Pharma Marketing Practices (ECPM), set up by the Organisations of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) as relevant in the case of AbbVie, to take appropriate action. The DoP also decided to conduct a special audit of the firm, necessitated by the seriousness of the allegations.\n\nThe special audit found AbbVie was in breach of UCPMP 2014 and UCPMP 2024. \"The total expenditure for 24 doctors travelling to Paris and six doctors to Monaco amounted to Rs 1.91 lakh for travel tickets and hotel accommodation, which was an explicit contravention of the codal provision,\" the DoP letter, in possession of ETV Bharat, states.\n\nAccording to paragraph 8.2 of UCPMP 2024, \"Companies or their representatives, or any person acting on their behalf, should not extend travel facilities inside or outside the country, including rail, air, ship, cruise tickets, paid vacations etc. to healthcare professionals or their family members (both immediate and extended) for attending conferences, seminars, workshops etc. unless the person is a speaker for a CME or a CPD Program.\"\n\nParagraph 8.1 states no gift should be offered or provided for the personal benefit of any healthcare professional or family member (both immediate and extended) by any pharmaceutical company or its agent i.e. distributors, wholesalers, retailers etc. Similarly, no pecuniary advantage or benefit in kind may be offered, supplied or promised to any person qualified to prescribe or supply drugs by any pharmaceutical company or its agents.\n\n\"Upon perusal of the facts and after hearing AbbVie at length, the apex committee thinks that the pharma company violated the provisions of the Uniform Code For Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices by sponsoring foreign vacations to Monaco and Paris for 30 HCPs in violation of the codal provision,\" the letter stated.\n\nAccordingly, the apex committee reprimands AbbVie for unethical marketing practices. \"The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) is requested to evaluate the tax liability of AbbVie along with 30 HCPs and take action in accordance with the provision of the Income Tax Act, 1961,\" the letter stated.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm\u2019s focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)\n\n10-Year Revenue CAGR: 10.97%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing and marketing innovative medicines and therapies for several health conditions. It prioritizes R&D to discover new treatments for complex diseases and maintains a competitive advantage through its diverse product portfolio.\n\nHumira, a flagship drug for autoimmune diseases, was a top revenue generator for the company, reaching sales of $21 billion in 2022. However, in Q3 2024, Humira\u2019s revenues declined to $2.23 billion, a 37.2% year-over-year decrease, attributed to the loss of patent exclusivity in 2023 and increased competition from biosimilar drugs.\n\nStill, the total revenue for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) rose by 3.8% year-over-year. The immunology segment was a key driver of this growth, generating $7.05 billion in revenue, a ~4% increase year-over-year. The company continues to be a strong investment option for long-term investors. It maintains robust financial performance and consistently rewards shareholders with attractive returns.\n\nIn its Q3 2024 investor letter, Polaris Global Equity Strategy discussed the strong performance of the US biopharma sector, with AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) demonstrating successful growth despite Humira\u2019s exclusivity loss. Here\u2019s what the firm had to say:\n\n\u201cU.S. biopharma/biotech companies topped the health care sector, with the majority of holdings posting returns in excess of 10%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) showed positive top-line growth from its immunosuppressive drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Abbvie\u2019s management continues to work through the loss of exclusivity from Humira, switching patients to Skyrizi or Rinvoq rather than Humira biosimilars.\u201d\n\nOverall ABBV ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
