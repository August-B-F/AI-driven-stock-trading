In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nNvidia\u2019s annual software developer conference, GTC, is in full swing. With its latest announcements, the company is doing all it can to assure investors of its dominance in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry. On Tuesday, CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote address in front of a packed hockey stadium in San Jose, California.\n\nHe noted how he believes that humanoid robots are less than five years away from wide use in manufacturing facilities. In this regard, he unveiled software tools that would reportedly help humanoid robots navigate the world more easily. Huang talked about humanoid robots when asked what signs would show that AI had become ubiquitous.\n\nHuang said it may be \"when, literally, humanoid robots are wandering around, which is not five years away. This is not five-years-away problem, this is a few-years-away problem.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 High-Flying AI Stocks to Watch Today and 10 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar\n\nHuang asserted that the manufacturing industry is probably going to be the first to adopt humanoid robots. This is because it has well-defined tasks that robots can easily handle in a controlled environment.\n\n\"I think it ought to go to factories first. And the reason for that is because the domain is much more guard-railed, and the use case is much more specific. The value of it is very, very easy to determine. The going rate for renting a human robot is probably $100,000 and I think it's pretty good economics.\"\n\nThe chipmaker's CEO reportedly has big plans for the AI data center industry too. Debuting silicon photonics networking systems, Huang noted that their Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics can join hundreds and even thousands of GPUs, enabling data center companies to deploy up to 1 million GPU clusters.\n\nHuang further noted how those million cluster data centers will be connected to other million-dollar data centers nearby to form massive data center facilities.\n\n\u201cOver the next several years, we're going to be building giant AI factories. Not normal AI factories \u2026 ones you see from space.\u201d\n\nThe GTC keynote also talked about the company\u2019s latest advancements, from Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics to Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin Superchips, which are going to help customers operate powerful AI systems to drive better revenue opportunities.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other best predictive analytics stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nPredictive analytics, sometimes called big data analytics, is an integral part of today\u2019s corporate arsenal. It is a subset of advanced analytics that makes use of statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to predict future occurrences and gain insights from previous data. In addition, it includes tools and processes such as data mining and modeling, all aimed at examining data, identifying trends, and making informed predictions. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global predictive analytics industry was valued at $14.71 billion in 2023, and is predicted to reach $95.3 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%.\n\nCompanies are always looking for ways to stay ahead of the competition and make smart choices that lead to success. This has led to a growing reliance on data-driven decisions. With consolidated analytics, machine learning models, and AI technologies, it\u2019s now possible to analyze more companies in a larger area range at a faster rate than ever before. This is especially true for the practice of venture capitalism. Many early-stage startup investors use data-driven decision-making to guide their lead sourcing and investments. While the instinct for scouting great investment opportunities is typically developed over years of experience, venture capital firms and associates can improve their scouting process by analyzing a variety of ecosystems. According to a data-driven VC analysis, by this year, data, analytics, and artificial intelligence would be used to guide investment decisions in 75% of all VC deals. This access to high-quality data reduces venture capitalists\u2019 risk of losing out on opportunities and assists them in identifying high-potential firms that might otherwise go undiscovered. Moreover, the combination of predictive analytics with artificial intelligence has resulted in a significant improvement in the depth of data insights. According to a Fortune Business Insights report on the AI sector, it is predicted to grow rapidly, with a CAGR of 29.2%. This rise is expected to bring the industry\u2019s size to $1.7 trillion by 2032, a significant increase from the $233.46 billion in 2024.\n\nPredictive Analytics in Healthcare\n\nMuch like many other industries, predictive analytics can be a boon for the healthcare sector. Due to its data-driven approach, it offers the potential to improve preventative care, resource management, and operational efficiency. In this perspective, the global healthcare predictive analytics market was valued at $12.96 billion in 2023 and is expected to rise at a compound yearly growth rate of 35% between 2024 and 2032. Furthermore, the growing volume of healthcare data from numerous sources, including wearable devices, mobile health applications, and electronic health records (EHRs), creates new opportunities for sophisticated analytics solutions. To illustrate this, the World Economic Forum estimates that hospitals create 50 petabytes of data every year.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with our list of the 11 best predictive analytics stocks to buy, we went through a variety of online publications, ETFs, and stock screeners. We then looked at the analyst upside of each company and ranked the ones with the highest upside potential. Our ranking is arranged in ascending order of analyst upside as of March 10, 2025. Additionally, we have included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Upside: 16.93%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN), based in Dublin, Ireland, is a multinational professional services firm specializing in IT consulting, digital transformation, and management solutions. The company began developing predictive analytics capabilities over a decade ago and is now on track to become a premier AI and data company. On that front, Accenture recently announced a strategic investment in Aaru, a company specializing in AI-powered prediction technology. It intends to incorporate Aaru\u2019s flagship model, Lumen, into its AI product and service portfolio.\n\nOn March 6, Goldman Sachs restated its Buy rating and $430 price target on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). According to Goldman Sachs, despite worries about macro demand risks, prospective government expenditure cuts, and foreign exchange implications, the IT Services industry is likely to recover in 2025 after reaching a cyclical low. This view is consistent with Accenture\u2019s position as a leading player in the IT Services market.\n\nFurthermore, on March 4th, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) announced the acquisition of Halfspace, a Denmark-based company that uses AI, data science, and analytics solutions to expedite business operations among companies.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue finding compelling new ideas, even as the bull market proceeds. In Q3, we initiated three new positions in Aon, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and Builders FirstSource. Accenture is a leading global IT services and consultancy business. We think the services it provides \u2014 which are differentiated and in specialty areas relative to many of its peers \u2014 are critical and will be in high demand in the technology ecosystem for years to come. This should contribute to stable prices and margins. We believe the market is undervaluing Accenture relative to the opportunity ahead of it and, consequently, were able to initiate a position in the quarter at a discounted share price.\u201d\n\nOverall, ACN ranks 9th on our list of best predictive analytics stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Despite the challenges in the federal sector, Accenture has increased its AI and data workforce to 72,000 employees, with a target of 80,000 by the end of fiscal 2026.\n\nAccenture's stock took a sharp 7% dip on Thursday following CEO Julie Sweet\u2019s warning that the consulting giant is facing a revenue hit due to cost-cutting measures implemented by the Trump administration. While Sweet acknowledged potential growth opportunities arising from shifting government priorities, she underscored the ongoing uncertainty impacting Accenture\u2019s federal business.\n\nSpeaking during Accenture\u2019s second fiscal quarter 2025 earnings call, Sweet maintained that the company remains on track for strong growth. However, she admitted that recent federal policy changes have slowed procurement actions, directly affecting Accenture Federal Services, which contributed 8% of the company\u2019s global revenue and 16% of its Americas revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently,\u201d Sweet stated. \u201cDuring this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue. Additionally, the General Services Administration (GSA) has instructed federal agencies to review contracts with the top 10 highest-paid consulting firms, including Accenture Federal Services. The GSA\u2019s guidance aims to terminate contracts deemed non-essential, leading to ongoing uncertainty as these assessments unfold.\u201d\n\nReports suggest that the GSA has already canceled approximately 1,700 consulting contracts across federal agencies since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, highlighting the scale of disruption facing government contractors.\n\nBeyond federal contracts, Sweet pointed to a broader climate of economic and geopolitical uncertainty affecting business outlooks. This marks a notable shift from Accenture\u2019s first-quarter earnings report in December. While she remained optimistic about the company\u2019s positioning, Sweet acknowledged the challenges posed by global trade dynamics, tariff discussions, and fluctuating consumer sentiment.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks is an elevated level of uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a global conversation around tariffs, not just in the Americas but in Europe as well. We\u2019re seeing major spending shifts in areas like defense, where we have been investing and are well-positioned.\u201d\n\nAI and Business Growth\n\nDespite the challenges in the federal sector, Accenture\u2019s AI business continues to gain momentum. Sweet reported $1.4 billion in new generative AI bookings and approximately $600 million in revenue from AI services during the quarter. The company has increased its AI and data workforce to 72,000 employees, with a target of 80,000 by the end of fiscal 2026.\n\n\u201cOur clients are focused on reinvention, and generative AI is a key driver,\u201d Sweet noted. \u201cThey are investing in building digital cores, improving cost efficiency, and scaling AI-driven solutions across various industries.\u201d\n\nFor its second fiscal quarter, Accenture reported $16.66 billion in revenue, a 5% increase year-over-year. Consulting revenue stood at $8.28 billion (up 3%), while managed services revenue reached $8.38 billion (up 8%). The company\u2019s Americas revenue rose 9% to $8.55 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Accenture expects third-quarter revenue between $16.9 billion and $17.5 billion, with full-year revenue growth projected at 5% to 7%. The company plans to invest $2 billion to $3 billion in acquisitions in fiscal 2025.\n\nJulie Sweet\u2019s Health Update\n\nLast month, Sweet disclosed that she has been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer but emphasized that her prognosis is excellent. She will undergo surgery next week, followed by radiation treatment, but will continue to lead Accenture\u2019s operations, albeit with reduced travel.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible Global Management Committee supported by amazing teams worldwide,\u201d she reassured employees in an internal memo. \u201cI am confident that we will continue to deliver 360-degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners, and communities.\u201d\n\nDespite mounting challenges, Accenture remains focused on navigating policy shifts while leveraging AI-driven innovation to sustain its long-term growth.",

            "content": ".\n\nAccenture becomes first consulting company to be 'hit' by DOGE\n\nThe Donald Trump administration is intensifying its investigation into federal consultancies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp and Accenture Plc, demanding that these companies describe their work in clear, simple terms rather than \"jargon or gobbledygook,\" Bloomberg reports. According to a letter seen by Bloomberg News, Josh Gruenbaum, the General Services Administration\u2019s new top procurement official, wrote to the 10 highest-paid consulting companies serving the government, requesting detailed information about their billions in government contracts and their plans to \"reduce or eliminate spend.\" Gruenbaum warned, \"Do not submit a scorecard that does not identify any waste and spend reduction opportunities,\" adding that submissions failing to highlight cost savings would lack credibility and signal misalignment with the administration\u2019s cost-cutting objectives.Gruenbaum, a former private equity executive and investment banker from KKR & Co. and Moelis & Co., appointed by President Donald Trump to oversee GSA procurement, instructed the consulting companies to submit pricing reduction recommendations by March 31 in language \"a 15-year-old should be able to understand.\" This follows GSA\u2019s earlier directive to federal agencies to justify their contracts with consultancies, including major players like Deloitte Consulting LLP, Bloomberg report adds.Earlier this week, Accenture\u2019s stock dropped after the company reported a slowdown in its US government work, tied to Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) push to cut the federal workforce and budget. CEO Julie Sweet said at the earnings call that federal services made up about 8% of Accenture\u2019s global revenue and 16% of its Americas revenue in fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, Science Applications International Corp., another firm in DOGE \u2019s sights, said its contracts have seen minimal impact so far but acknowledged potential shifts as the administration ramps up its fight against \"waste, fraud and abuse.\"The report highlights that the federal government spent $759 billion on contracts in 2023, relying on external firms for professional services, tech support, and R&D, per Government Accountability Office data. Supporters argue this outsourcing saves money by leveraging outside expertise. Other targeted firms include IBM, General Dynamics, Leidos, Guidehouse, HII Mission Technologies, and CGI Federal, none of which immediately commented on GSA\u2019s letter.The GSA is mandating that these consultants submit a form outlining payments received from agencies between 2019 and 2024, along with details of their work types and pricing models. According to Bloomberg News, the GSA has already terminated 1,700 consulting contracts, based on internal agency data released earlier this week.\u201cWe are seeing an elevated level of what was already a significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY 2025 earnings report in December. At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong,\" Sweet noted.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights.\n\nA new open-source model from Mistral AI is shaking things up in the tech world. This groundbreaking model outperforms comparable models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, delivering inference speeds of 150 tokens per second. Mistral Small 3.1 surpasses the performance of leading small proprietary models across dimensions such as handling text, understanding multimodal inputs, supporting multiple languages, and managing long contexts, all that with low latency and cost efficiency.\n\nShifting focus to China, Tencent has recently captured attention with its suite of new artificial intelligence tools capable of converting text and images into 3D visuals. The company has released five open-source models based on its Hunyuan3D-2.0 technology, including \u201cturbo\u201d versions that can generate 3D visuals within 30 seconds while maintaining high precision and quality.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Turning Heads on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar\n\nLike many other Chinese firms, Tencent is advancing China\u2019s position in the AI arms race by expanding its capital expenditures. According to Tencent President Martin Lau, capital spending would rise to the \u201clow teens\u201d as a percentage of revenue, and artificial intelligence will be a key focus of strategic investments.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to increase our AI investments, increasing investment in our proprietary Hunyuan model while expanding our contributions in multimodal and open-source capabilities.\u201d \u2013Martin Lau.\n\nMeanwhile, once an AI leader in China, Baidu is also striving hard to regain its position in the tech world. The company has released two new free-to-use artificial intelligence models, including its first reasoning-focused model. The move comes ahead of its plans to move toward an open-source strategy.\n\nAccording to an article by The Financial Times on why China is suddenly flooding the markets with AI models, retaliation appears to be the driving force. When the US tightened its grip on advanced artificial intelligence technologies in January, it blocked off China\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and locked proprietary models behind trade barriers.\n\nEven though it seemed that China would retaliate by doubling down on secrecy, it\u2019s doing quite the opposite, and with good reason. Chinese tech groups are seemingly creating an ecosystem where developers can continuously revamp their models. Provided open-source becomes powerful enough, there would be no reason to pay for closed models if free, equally capable alternatives exist.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) offers strategy and consulting services. On March 17, the company announced that it has expanded its AI Refinery\u2122 platform by launching an AI agent builder, allowing business users to quickly build and customize agents. The company is also expanding its collection of pre-configured industry agent solutions to allow clients to scale networks of AI agents across the enterprise. Accenture plans to develop more than 50 industry-specific AI agent solutions in the coming months, and more than 100 solutions by the end of the year.\n\nThe new Agent Builder is part of the AI Refinery and is built on Nvidia AI Enterprise, Nvidia\u2019s end-to-end, cloud-native software platform. Clients will be able to create and customize agent teams driven by changing business needs and market conditions, and that too, without the need coding for or waiting for support from engineering or technical teams.\n\n\u201cWe are seizing the significant opportunity to help our clients prioritize bold, high-impact initiatives that tackle core business challenges by reinventing processes end-to-end with generative AI and agentic technology. Accenture continues to double-down on new innovations like agent builder on our AI Refinery platform to empower organizations and decision-makers with the flexibility to drive business value faster, with agents that can observe the environment, apply reason, continuously improve and take action.\u201d -Lan Guan, chief AI officer, Accenture.\n\nOverall, ACN ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Reported EPS is $2.82, expectations were $2.81.\n\nOperator: Good day, and welcome to Accenture\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O\u2019Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O\u2019Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I\u2019m Katie O\u2019Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today\u2019s call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today\u2019s call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2025.\n\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we\u2019ll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today\u2019s news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.\n\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie, and everyone joining this morning, and thank you to our more than 800,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a very strong quarter, creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Starting with our quarter, we are very pleased with our results as we continue to deliver on our strategy to return to strong growth in FY \u201825. I will share some highlights from the quarter and then turn to an update on new developments since we were together in December in our federal business and the current environment more broadly. Our clients continue to prioritize large scale transformations and we are their reinvention partner of choice as reflected in our bookings of $20.9 billion, including 32 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million.\n\nWe grew 8.5% in local currency with revenue of $16.7 billion at the top end of our guided range and we continue to take market share on a rolling four quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in Gen AI with $1.4 billion in new bookings and approximately $600 million in revenue. Operating margin contracted 20 basis points compared to adjusted operating margin last year, and we delivered EPS growth of 2% over Q2 FY \u201824 adjusted EPS. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas with over $250 million deployed primarily across six strategic acquisitions and we invested in our people with approximately 15 million training hours this quarter, designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using Gen AI.\n\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 72,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY 2026. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which is a component of our long-term growth strategy. This quarter, in India, we launched a transformative hospitality skilling program in collaboration with our client, Marriott International, which prepares disadvantaged use (ph) for entry-level jobs in the hospitality sector, including training for digital skills. Because we help our clients execute on some of their most important priorities, and we need to attract and retain the best people, recognition of Accenture as an ethical and admired company is critical for our clients\u2019 confidence and to attract these great talent.\n\nWe are pleased that we have been recognized by Ethisphere, as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies for the 18th year in a row and for the third consecutive year, we ranked number one in our industry and among the top five overall on JUST Capital America\u2019s Most Just Companies. In addition, thanks to our clients, partners, and the wider business community, we earned the number one position in our industry for the 12th year in a row and number 30 overall, our highest paid on Fortune\u2019s list of the World\u2019s Most Admired Companies. Now for two updates. First, Accenture Federal Services. Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY \u201824. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the Federal government more efficiently.\n\nDuring this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue. In addition, recently, the General Service Administration has instructed all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest paid consulting firms contracting with the U.S. government, which includes Accenture Federal Services. The GSA\u2019s guidance would determinate contracts that are not deemed mission critical by the federal \u2014 by the relevant federal agencies. While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government\u2019s priorities evolve and these assessments unfold. Based on our significant experience across federal and commercial clients, we see major opportunities over time for us to help consolidate, modernize, and reinvent the federal government to drive a whole new level of efficiency.\n\nSecond, in recent weeks, we are seeing an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY \u201825 earnings report in December. At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong and we are very well positioned with our clients because all strategies continue to lead to reinvention through new ways of working, tech, data, and AI. We are confident in executing our strategy to help clients reinvest. As you would expect, we are laser focused on bringing tremendous value to our clients. Our strengths lie in our agility as the market we operate and changes, utilizing our deep client and ecosystem relationships and our leading position in Gen AI and technology more broadly.\n\nWe are also well diversified across markets, industries, and types of work, which enables us to continue to lead in a changing market context as we have done before. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call. We were very pleased with our results in the second quarter, particularly our continued strong top line growth, which was once again broad based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and managed services. Let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 8.5% in local currency, which was at the top end of our guided range, with nine of our 13 industries growing high-single digit or higher, and we continue to take market share. We delivered EPS in the quarter of $2.82, reflecting 2% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin of 13.5% for the quarter decreased 20 basis points compared to adjusted Q2 results last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business.\n\nFinally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we have invested almost $500 million, primarily attributed to 11 acquisitions. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $20.9 billion for the quarter, a 3% decrease in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed Services bookings were $10.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.7 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 8.5% in local currency. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately negative 3% compared with a negative 2.5% estimate provided last quarter.\n\nConsulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency. Managed Services revenue were $8.4 billion, up 8% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology managed services, which includes application managed services and infrastructure managed services, and high-single digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency, growth was led by banking and capital markets, industrial, health, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 8% growth in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences and consumer goods, retail, and travel services.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 1% in local currency, driven by growth in insurance and utilities, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared to 30.9% for the second quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.1% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3% compared to 6.9% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of last year, we recorded $115 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 70 basis points in EPS by $0.14.\n\nThe following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.5% operating margin, a 20 basis point decrease from adjusted operating margin in Q2 of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.8% for the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.82 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.77 in the second quarter last year, reflecting 2% growth. Days services outstanding were 48 days compared to 50 days last quarter and 43 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.7 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.9 billion net of property and equipment additions of $171 million.\n\nOur cash balance at February 28 was $8.5 billion compared with $5 billion at the end of \u2014 at August 31. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4 million shares for $1.4 billion at an average price of $361.16 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $929 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on May 15, a 15% increase over last year. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, our clients continue to be focused on reinvention and Gen AI is a catalyst for reinvention. They are focused on building the digital core with more AI being built-in, which is driving our growth, and on areas such as the customer and core operations, including supply chain and Industry X. For our clients, the twin themes of achieving both cost efficiency and growth continue. The number of clients embracing Gen AI is increasing significantly and we are starting to see some tangible examples of scale in data and AI. We are partnering with Telstra, Australia\u2019s leading telecommunications company to create a new joint venture to accelerate its data and AI roadmap and fast track the business into a new era of AI-driven reinvention.\n\nThrough the joint venture, we will work together to simplify and modernize their data systems and set up a comprehensive AI foundation to deploy advanced AI solutions across their organization. Value driving AI use cases have been identified across the business that are suitable for scaling and will enhance network resilience, deliver seamless connectivity, and better customer experience. Using our AI Refinery platform, we will reimagine business processes by implementing Agentic AI. Specialized AI tools will support their employees to work smarter and faster and teams to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, we will help evolve Telstra\u2019s Data and AI Academy, a company-wide upskilling initiative leveraging our learning and development programs, helping to build data and AI fluency and feature critical skills across its workforce.\n\nBuilding on Telstra\u2019s globally leading responsible AI practices, the JV is designed to sustain and improve on this by identifying and mitigating AI risks while building trust and adoption as it scales AI across the organization. This partnership with Telstra illustrates to clients that there are creative ways to accelerate their own use of data and AI. Clients in Australia from banking, retail, and utilities are working with us to design their own innovative ways to jumpstart their reinvention with data and AI. We continue to see our clients building their digital core as a foundation for reinvention and increasingly asking us to incorporate emerging technologies like AI, as well as data into this work. Cloud saw double-digit growth this quarter and security had very strong double-digit growth.\n\nWe are working together with a multinational food processing company to help reinvent themselves as a data-driven organization, revolutionizing their enterprise. This includes the end-to-end supply chain and frontline sales function to support rapid growth. Our unique partnership model uses our library of AI and Gen AI assets to quickly deliver productivity, with the potential of generating over $0.5 billion in value to self-fund their reinvention. The savings are reinvested into an ongoing build out of a robust digital core, which becomes the foundation to support and enable any new technologies, processes or systems the company may adopt in the future. For example, the company is using Gen AI to forecast inventory risks and generate next best action recommendation, saving them millions of dollars annually.\n\nIf excess inventory on a product is selling slower than expected in a region, Gen AI tools proactively prompt promotional sale or halt production before the inventory results in a margin loss. In another instance, an AI-based communication platform was deployed that eliminates up to five different language barriers between supervisors and frontline workers, and plants, (ph) reducing costly errors from miscommunications and delays. With many households having at least one of their products, this company\u2019s commitment to ongoing transformation will position them to continue to build, design, and run a future ready enterprise, rethink work, and drive innovation. We are helping one of the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturers modernize their security operations to protect the company\u2019s critical IT systems and stay ahead of the rapidly evolving security landscape.\n\nWe will implement a modern threat detection and response platform that will enable the company to integrate its data across the enterprise, identifying cyber threats and responding to incidents faster. We are building a new Gen AI security engine on Accenture\u2019s My Security platform, which will help automate cloud migration tasks, moving the threat detection capability from the legacy platform to the new one without interruption. This is expected to increase the company\u2019s operational excellence, enhance cyber resiliency, increase risk visibility, and drive a significant improvement in efficiency. With the new platform, the company will be able to better safeguard digital assets, including information critical to automotive design and manufacturing.\n\nThis collaboration will help better protect the company, its partners, and customers setting the stage for advanced AI, smart manufacturing, and increased innovation. To capture the value of technologies like Generative AI, companies need a digital core and now to stay ahead and truly scale AI, companies also need what we call a cognitive digital brain, and always on and always learning system, as we shared in our Tech Vision 2025. Our industry expertise is critical to building the digital core and digital brain, a deep knowledge of the processes today and how they can be reinvented for tomorrow is key. Our proven track record of digital transformation and our ability to bring experience in strategy, consulting, industry, process, and technology services, and decades of experience in managed services for our clients, allows us to truly reinvent using AI, including digital agents to create transformational value at scale.\n\nWe are deepening our partnership with Repsol, a leading multi-energy company and a client for more than a decade to advance its digital program and scale Agentic AI, reinventing key business operations to drive sustainable growth. Over the past three years, we have built a secured cloud based digital core with a unified data foundation. Now we will use our AI Refinery platform to deploy customized AI agents across functions such as planning, forecasting, and customer service, making processes more dynamic and less complex. Employees will be able to work more efficiently and provide customers with accurate personalized products and services. For example, AI agents can analyze available data to offer timely and relevant bundled energy solutions, enhancing Repsol\u2019s position as an integrated provider.\n\nWe will upscale employees in AI and digital technologies through an expanded training program to support adoption. We are also exploring digital twins and robotic solutions to enhance planned maintenance and other tasks in industrial and logistics centers. Repsol is positioning itself as an early adopter of AI in the energy sector, increasing efficiency, boosting productivity, and promoting new ways of working to better serve customers. The transformation and digitization of manufacturing is an important area of growth and Industry X grew high-single digits this quarter. We are working with KION, a global leader in supply chain solutions to use AI powered digital twins to create smarter, safer and more adaptable warehouses that can evolve with the world around them and handle nearly any supply chain challenge, marking the next digital frontier.\n\nPicture a busy warehouse during peak shopping season, workers navigating narrow aisles and conveyor belts, forklifts, loading and unloading freight. Now imagine robots working seamlessly with human teams to fulfill orders faster and more safely. We are making this a reality by creating digital versions of physical assets such as conveyors and forklifts and integrating autonomous robots with human workers on an AI-driven platform that accurately stimulates millions of complex factory processes to help ensure safety and avoid disruptions before robots hit the factory floor. We are also predicting and adapting to real world challenges as they happen, such as how events like Black Friday sales or a product going viral might affect warehouse operations, adjusting robot brains in real-time.\n\nWith these investments \u2014 with these advancements, warehouse workers\u2019 responsibilities will evolve as they work alongside AI systems, making them more desirable candidates for higher skilled roles. Song grew double-digits this quarter as more clients seek to reinvent customer and experience. We have the unique ability to integrate creative data and AI, tech, and strategy while leveraging our industry and operations expertise to unlock marketing and sales as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies. We are partnering with a multinational conglomerate in the communications industry to streamline and optimize their media strategy and operations for their mobile division. We\u2019ve implemented a new digital platform with a unified data foundation, which will provide transparency and real time access to expedite campaign position.\n\nThe company will also reduce the number of media agencies to a single partner, Accenture Song, to maximize media spend outcomes. Accenture\u2019s marketing operations Managed Services will leverage automation and AI to increase efficiencies in manual routine tasks, which will allow employees to focus on more strategic work. These changes will also allow the company to shift from focusing solely on media related data to incorporating broader insights to make more strategic and informed decisions that benefit the entire company, such as predicting customer content preferences, which can drive more efficient media placement and sales. Talent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments and reinvention requires working in new ways and the development of new skills.\n\nLearnVantage positions us to help to be able to help clients develop talent and skills to drive future growth. Our clients are using LearnVantage to strengthen learning development, turbocharging the learner\u2019s experience. For example, we are bridging the skills gap and creating certification pathways for learners, using LearnVantage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will fast-track their careers and support their adoption of Gen AI. And a big box retailer has accelerated learning opportunities for entry level to highly technical skill sets, deepened understanding of current industry skills by role \u2014 needs by role, and empowered employees with guided learning based on the skills they need for their role. Finally, a look at how we continue to execute on our goal to strategically deploy $2 billion, $3 billion in B&A this fiscal year.\n\nWe are investing in our Industry X and supply chain capabilities with our acquisitions this quarter of AOX and Staufen AG in Germany. We also acquired IQT Group in Italy, a managed services provider, which will help utility providers build and modernize integrated electricity and water networks. To continue to lead in Gen AI, we acquired Halfspace in Denmark to help our clients in the Nordics region leverage and scale AI to make better, more informed decisions faster, and to enable us to scale faster in financial services, we acquired Altus Consulting in the UK, a leader in consulting and digital transformation. Also this quarter, we purchased a digital twin technology platform for banks from Percipient, a Singapore based fintech company with deep expertise in banking technology transformation.\n\nBack to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park: Thanks, Julie. Before I get into the details of our outlook, as Julie mentioned, we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, including in our federal business. Because this change is very recent, our revenue guidance range for both Q3 and the full year reflects our best view based upon what we see today, which may evolve differently from our estimates and assumptions. With that said, let me turn now to the business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal \u201925, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.9 billion to $17.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u201924 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year \u201925, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal \u201924.\n\nFor the full fiscal \u201925, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal \u201924. We continue to expect an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3% with about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. And we now expect to invest about $2 billion to $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year \u201925 to be 15.6% to 15.7%, a 10 basis point to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal \u201924 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal \u201924. We now expect our full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal \u201925 to be in the range of $12.55 to $12.79 or 5% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal \u201924 results.\n\nFor the full fiscal \u201925, we continue to expect operating cash flow in the range of $9.4 billion to $10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. As we move into the second half of the year, we remain laser focused on managing our business with rigor and discipline. With that, let\u2019s open it up, so we can take your questions.\n\nKatie O\u2019Conor: Thanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Accenture Ltd (NYSE:ACN) Follow Accenture Ltd (NYSE:ACN) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks for all of this. So I just wanted to start outside of U.S. Federal, so the other 92% of the business. Can you just clarify to what extent you are or not seeing clients hit the pause button at all on new initiatives, any change in pace of converting pipeline to backlog or backlog into revenue? You can certainly appreciate that your tone is a little bit more cautious, maybe the visibility isn\u2019t quite as high, but are you seeing tangible signs of any pause in client activity at this point in time?\n\nAngie Park: Hi, Jason. Good morning. Thanks for your question. For us, there\u2019s really \u2014 we\u2019ve seen no change overall.\n\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And, as you can imagine, some of these changes are relatively recent, and so we\u2019re in a lot of discussions. In some cases, those discussions are about accelerating, particularly in the cost discussions, right, like, can we go a little faster to get to our programs for places where we\u2019re contracting. And we are at the heart of many of the discussions where businesses are trying to process what this might mean, so \u2014 but we\u2019re not seeing any pauses now.\n\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. So we got to watch and wait on that. So let\u2019s go to U.S. Federal just for a minute. Can you just clarify for us what the growth rate was in U.S. Federal revenue in the quarter and what you\u2019re assuming for the second half of the year in U.S. Federal?\n\nAngie Park: Jason, why don\u2019t I take that because I think it\u2019s important to give a little bit of context on our Q3 and our full year guidance. And certainly, as it relates to Q2 specifically for Federal, we really don\u2019t provide that during the year, and as you know, we provide that at the end of the year. So let me just start with \u2014 because I do think this is important. When you think about \u2014 we were really pleased with the quarter, our second quarter and the first half of the year. And for the second quarter, we did deliver revenue at the top end of our range and we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to update our guidance to 5% to 7% by taking off the bottom. So \u2014 and why is that? So, we\u2019re pleased with how our business is positioned with the larger deals coming online, which was a very deliberate part of our strategy.\n\nAnd then as you think about Q3 and the full year, it includes our current estimates and assumptions of the potential impacts of federal and the overall environment. And then, if I just break apart organic and inorganic, from an inorganic contribution, we continue to expect a bit over 3% with H2 about 2%, which is consistent with what we shared last quarter in our assumptions. And then for the year, what that means is, from an organic perspective, we now expect 2% to 4% in organic growth for the year. And by type of work to provide that context as well, consulting, we continue to expect to be in the mid-single digit range growth and we now see managed services at high-single digits.\n\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood.\n\nAngie Park: And importantly, and then \u2014 Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much. So great to hear from you, Julie and Angie. Just maybe I will ask, instead of demand, I want to ask on the margin outlook and the change there. How much of that is organic versus inorganic in terms of the change? And is it just \u2014 I\u2019m always getting questions, is there cost \u2014 is it just costing more to do business? Is there a cost to execution here going up? Is there a pricing change? What more can you share?\n\nAngie Park: Sure. And as it relates \u2014 thank you, Tien-Tsin. As it relates to inorganic, our capital deployed, we\u2019ve updated \u2014 we may be a bit lighter at $2 billion to $3 billion, but relative from a margin profile, no change there. And so let me just peel this back a little bit. In this quarter, we did see a decrease in our gross margins, primarily due to higher subcontractor costs and the impact of our business optimization actions, which reduced severance costs in Q2 of last year. And as you know, this fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, which is really why we manage the overall operating margin. And as you think about our operating margin for the year, based upon where we are, we now expect a 10 basis points to 20 basis points expansion for the year, while continuing to invest significantly in our business and our people.\n\nAnd look, we\u2019re seeing the variability in the operating margin throughout the year that we expected. So what are we focused on? Pricing, which this quarter was relatively stable. How we deliver our contracts and how we run our business, which includes managing supply and demand and digitizing and making our own operations more efficient. So we feel really good about our full year guidance of 10 basis points to 20 basis points, which includes EPS growth at 5% to 7%.\n\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And, Tien-Tsin, we always update \u2014 we typically update about this time. We just don\u2019t see \u2014 we didn\u2019t see the 30 basis points. It\u2019s a super competitive market. So while pricing is relatively stable as we\u2019ve been talking about, it\u2019s a competitive market, so.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. No, that\u2019s all clear. Thanks for going through that. Just my follow-up, I think Jason asked about Federal already. Is there \u2014 maybe to ask it differently, just is there a way to frame the real revenue at risk? I know mission-critical is, maybe hard to define it here on the call, but is there anything that you can share in terms of what\u2019s really at risk or not at risk thinking about duration or is it really more of an issue of replenishing work, etc.? Just trying to get a better understanding of visibility there. Thank you.\n\nAngie Park: Sure. And so, Tien-Tsin, what I would say is, and what we\u2019ve been clear about is the guided range we\u2019re giving for the quarter and for the year reflects our best view of the impact that\u2019s coming from both the slowing of new procurement actions and the assessments of the work that we\u2019re doing, and so we don\u2019t get into different pieces of it, but [Technical Difficulty] those two things, the range of outcomes and that\u2019s reflected in the range. I mean, it is 8% of our business. We have lots of other parts of our business that are about that size that we are always looking at estimates and assumptions. And so this is our best view of it today and the range reflects it.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Your view is better than mine and glad to see the bottom end of the range taken up here. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one is, Julie, just thinking about how budgets were set and how conversations may be changed from January, February to March, could you give us some color on that?\n\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. I\u2019d start with, as we went into this calendar year, we did not see kind of \u2014 like kind of across the board a meaningful increase in budgets for our services. So we saw more of the same, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about, and as we went into the budgets \u2014 as the budgets were set, it was kind of more of the same. And it\u2019s pretty early right now in terms of processing, right, what just happened and there\u2019s a lot of different things that can happen, right? So you sometimes see clients reprioritizing like maybe they\u2019ll go faster on the cost cutting than on some of the building in that, and it \u2014 even those \u2014 that kind of a conversation, it\u2019s super early, right? And so what we are seeing though is a continuation that these conversations always turn to, okay, we got to go faster and we got to go bigger.\n\nAnd this theme around cost and growth because that\u2019s really the unique way that we can help clients. So one of the examples that I gave in the script around a major manufacturer of food supplies is all about like when you are better managing inventory and supply chain, that\u2019s both driving growth and at the same time, self-funding big transformation programs. So I think right now, if you think about just what is the impact of an elevated level of uncertainty, it\u2019s the same thing as what we\u2019ve been seeing like, more desire to do larger transformation. And while we\u2019re at it, because I\u2019m sure the question will come, discretionary spending this quarter, Q2 was overall about the same, still constrained. There were some pockets of improvement, for example, in banking and capital markets in the Americas, but again, going into the calendar year, discretionary spending was overall about the same constraint, and particularly in small deals that we\u2019ve been seeing.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s kind of where we are.\n\nAngie Park: And I would just add, Julie, thanks for that. I would just add that as you think about our guidance for the full year as well, and what it assumes is discretionary spend does not have to improve at the top end of the range, while it continues to allow for further deterioration at the bottom.\n\nBryan Keane: Yeah, Angie. As my follow-up, I was going to ask, if you take the midpoint of that third quarter constant currency revenue, you get to about 5%. It implies fourth quarter revenue range looks a little wider than usual and maybe a couple of points lower than the third quarter. So just kind of what\u2019s built-in? Are you building in a little bit of a slowdown in organic growth in that fourth quarter or is that just some level of elevated uncertainty that goes into the fourth quarter number? Thanks so much.\n\nAngie Park: Bryan, your math is right. So we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, and so we spoke about that. And you\u2019re correct that if you think about our inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3% for the full year, it was roughly 4% in the first half. We\u2019re expecting about 2% in the second half, which means, really importantly, that our organic growth for the full year is now 2% to 4%.\n\nBryan Keane: Okay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good job. And I guess my first question, health and public services typically is kind of flattish sequentially in Q2. It was down about 5% sequentially and I guess kind of asking Jason\u2019s question too, is some of that U.S. Federal or are there other parts of health and public services that were weaker than normal? I\u2019m just trying to understand that.\n\nJulie Sweet: Hi, David. Good morning. Nothing to read into that. We didn\u2019t see any material impact within H&PS, it just ebbs and flows over the quarters, so nothing to really comment there.\n\nDavid Koning: Okay. And just as a follow-up, I think you might have mentioned pricing was pretty stable. I looked back the last seven quarters, you called pricing as being down a bit. I mean, are we starting to get back to a more stable environment for pricing?\n\nJulie Sweet: So as you think about our pricing, we did comment that it was relatively stable. The market continues to be very competitive. And so what you can count on us to do is, we\u2019re always focused on it. And just as a reminder, pricing is the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\n\nDavid Koning: Yeah. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\n\nOperator: And our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. As we talk about the little bit of the slowdown that you\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, how would you characterize it geographically or industry vertical? Just trying to get a little more color there. And what do you think those customers are looking for in terms of their proceed or continue to pause or hesitate type of decision making?\n\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, James. I want to be clear, we haven\u2019t seen a slowdown in the last few weeks. What we commented on, which I think is kind of everyone is well aware of is in the last few weeks, there\u2019s been an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty and there\u2019s a couple of big themes around that, obviously tariffs, and that\u2019s a global discussion that is not just an Americas discussion. And also consumer sentiment, which is a little bit more of an Americas discussion. And so we\u2019re really just commenting on what I think we\u2019re all seeing and that\u2019s only been in the last few weeks, and so we\u2019re already, of course, in the heart of the discussions of clients globally who are talking about it. And you\u2019re seeing, for example, in Europe, there was an announcement of like major spending in areas like defense where we\u2019ve been investing and are well-positioned, and by the way, I do want to shout out to my UK team.\n\nHopefully, all of you noticed that the UK is back and we\u2019re driving our revenue, and it\u2019s a great example of how we address challenges by leveraging our ability to invest. We\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions there. The agility, the use of data, and AI, which are all driving the repositioning that you\u2019re starting to now see in the UK. So again, we have a lot of diversification of our business. And when you think about the Americas and the agenda now in federal with respect to consolidating, modernizing, and reinventing the federal government, we\u2019re incredibly well-positioned because we\u2019ve been driving already a lot of efficiency in the federal government with the work we\u2019ve been doing for decades. And we\u2019re now bringing that reinvention that we\u2019ve been doing now for a few years, those commercial solutions, we\u2019ve got the ability to bring that to the federal government as they move forward with their agenda.\n\nSo diverse \u2014 the conversation is global. Lots of opportunities depend on the market and we have a really strong position, and I\u2019ll just flag again the 32 clients this quarter who did over $100 million of bookings.\n\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great and great clarification there. I appreciate that. And then wanted to touch quickly on your AI and AI initiatives, etc. Can you give a little bit of color of how that\u2019s developing with your software partners? What kinds of improvements or adjustments in go-to-market that may entail? Just trying to get a sense for how you\u2019re working with the broader ecosystem to really drive results.\n\nJulie Sweet: Well, James, the ecosystem is absolutely critical here and this is where decades of relationships really matter, because this is \u2014 Gen AI is a new technology. The adoption of AI more broadly is new. It wasn\u2019t being adopted as much, and so we work so closely with our partners and the client really in three-way conversations and work in order to reinvent and do that. This is not \u2014 we\u2019re not taking things off the shelf and say, here go do this. And, as you know, we are the leader in ecosystem \u2014 with our ecosystem partners and that has been a major differentiating factor when you look at our growth, particularly in these large deals where the ecosystem is absolutely at the heart of it. And by the way, I\u2019m glad that you look \u2014 you commented on the Gen AI because I think it\u2019s important as we think about how Gen AI is developing that we don\u2019t walk past, that in H1, we did $1.1 billion in revenue, and last year, in FY \u201824, we did $900 million for the entire year.\n\nSo you\u2019re starting to see the leadership that we have in Gen AI really come through on the revenue side.\n\nJames Faucette: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you, Julie. Hope you\u2019re feeling well. I want to start on bookings. Can you just give us a sense on 2Q bookings? How they landed relative to your plan? Understanding just elevated uncertainty may extend signings, I\u2019m just curious if that did in fact play out in 2Q? And can you comment on how you feel you\u2019re set up for the second half in bookings?\n\nJulie Sweet: Well, just as a reminder, that elevated uncertainty has been in the last few weeks and so, no impact on our bookings. And Angie, do you want to add anything?\n\nAngie Park: Hi, Bryan. So for us, we were pleased with our bookings this quarter of $20.9 billion, and importantly, our book-to-bill was 1.3. And again, reinforcing and being the partner of choice for our clients with 32 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million, so we feel really good about that.\n\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then on the workforce, can you comment on how you\u2019re managing that mix of subcontractors versus employees? And is that higher sub-con mix in the quarter just some form of a transition component as you\u2019ve taken actions on bench across the organization or are there certain service types where you\u2019re having to lean a little bit more on that sub-con mix?\n\nAngie Park: Bryan, I think that as you think about our sub-contractor and our workforce mix, certainly that can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based upon the work that we\u2019re doing for our clients, and as it relates to this quarter, you saw that we added about two \u2014 a little bit over 2,000 people in Q2. And as always, what we are all about is managing our supply and demand, including through the use of technology and reskilling. And so for us \u2014 as you think about our workforce overall, sub-contractors can fluctuate and at the same time, what we focus on is our utilization, which continues to be 91%, which is exactly the range that we want to be in.\n\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\n\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Keith Bachman at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Perhaps I\u2019ll ask my two just concurrently since they\u2019re on similar veins. On the first one, one of the previous questions was asking about AI, more from the demand side or revenue side, I wanted to go back to the supply side and delivery side, and while \u2014 I think it\u2019s still really early in the life of Gen AI because most of the work is actually still test, not inferencing. But are you seeing any changes in the nature of your economic relationship with your customers? In other words, are customers asking for some of the savings or is there any change in that narrative on how the supply side and economic relationship broadly speaking with your customers may unfold as Gen AI matures a little bit?\n\nAnd then the second part of the question is, I wanted to just jump into Song for a bit. And sort of the same type of question. I spent the last day with Adobe and at their user group conference and there\u2019s tremendous efficiency gains associated with both marketing and creativity. And just, Julie, any comments, I know you mentioned Song had double-digit growth, which is quite impressive. How do you see the durable growth rate of Song? And so that\u2019s it for me. And Julie, all the best to you in particular.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Keith. So I think in the first question, what we\u2019ve been seeing with Gen AI is what we\u2019ve seen in the past when we have new technologies, like, I take you back to 2015 when we first announced MyWizard, which we now call GenWizard, as we\u2019ve introduced Gen AI and that was that major shift that occurred with respect to automation, which by the way is still relevant, right? And so that \u2014 we are not seeing a different change. We\u2019ve been continuously \u2014 remember like, particularly, on the managed service side, our contracts assume that there\u2019s going to be more efficiency driven from technology. Gen AI is allowing that to kind of go up over time. But like the way that the model is working is just very similar to what we\u2019ve seen with prior waves of big efficiencies from technology.\n\nSo we\u2019re not seeing new patterns evolve there. And of course, we are \u2014 really our strategy is to lead in both helping our clients use Gen AI, but also to lead in our own use of Gen AI. And at the same time, it is still early in the technology. It\u2019s still expensive. So you have to get to the right ROI, in terms of when to use it. It requires our clients to have foundations in place. This isn\u2019t just sort of push a button and we can have Gen AI, and so we should expect that \u2014 remember that this is still a very early in the technology cycle. Excuse me, with respect to Song, one of the big areas that we\u2019re helping our clients on is build the data foundation in order to use the Gen AI because those efficiencies that you\u2019re seeing, and as you know, we\u2019re Adobe\u2019s major partner, require the right data foundation and they require really the reinvention of processes.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that in our own marketing where we\u2019ve been using Agentic AI, but you had to completely change the way that you\u2019re doing marketing. And so Song\u2019s durability is being at the heart of building the digital core and helping them do the reinvention while leading in our own use of Gen AI, which is what we continue to be focused on. So I feel very good about Song. And importantly, our diversification is we want to be relevant to all parts of the enterprise and the growth agenda, which is what Song positions us in addition to our entire \u2014 the ability to be at the core operations and at the enterprise. So really very pleased with how our strategy to be relevant across the enterprise continues to give us resilience in the market.\n\nKeith Bachman: Thank you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jonathan Lee at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Lee: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to clarify the change in the revenue outlook here. Your original outlook contemplated status quo at the high end of the outlook, is that still the case? And is that indexed to what you\u2019re seeing today with the elevated uncertainty, but not necessarily any sort of slowdown?\n\nAngie Park: Hi, Jonathan. Thanks for the question, and yes, that\u2019s correct. So with our assumptions, the range of 5% to 7%, which we raised for the full year is that discretionary spend, does not have to improve at the top end of the range, and while at the bottom of the range, it allows for further deterioration.\n\nJonathan Lee: Thanks for that color, Angie. And then on the pricing front, it\u2019s good to hear about the pricing stability you\u2019re seeing despite the competitive environment. How do we think through the timing in which it takes stable pricing to flow through the P&L, especially as it looks like we\u2019re still digesting some of the pricing headwinds we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few quarters?\n\nAngie Park: As you think about pricing, it does take time for it to layer in, and certainly, it depends on the mix of the deals that we\u2019re selling as well. So we\u2019ll see that come through over time.\n\nJonathan Lee: Appreciate that.\n\nAngie Park: Thank you.\n\nKatie O\u2019Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And Julie, I just want to wish you \u2014 echo that and wish you my best as well. When we think about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the larger transformational contracts that benefit \u2014 that are benefiting you so much this year despite slower discretionary or not a real improvement in discretionary yet. Just remind us again where you are on that path. I mean, again, bookings was a question before. It was up one or \u2014 maybe it was more or less flat year-over-year, but your book-to-bill is still very strong, obviously. And so just help us understand what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the most transformational contracts right now that can give us room despite sort of whatever outcomes are on the discretionary.\n\nAnd then one quick follow-up. Julie, I know when we spoke last, you talked about how there was so much in terms of like waiting by executive CIOs, CEOs, and others on tariffs and some of the policies you talked about earlier, if we do get some resolution on that in the next couple of months, April 2, could be a big day for the administration in terms of explaining. I mean, how much have you heard from your customers on how much they\u2019re just really waiting? There\u2019s pent-up demand budget. Just help us understand that a little more if you can.\n\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So on the demand side, the 32 clients with bookings over $100 million just continue to show that we\u2019re executing on that strategy, but what clients want to buy are larger transformational deals. They want the reinvention and we continue to execute on that too again because that\u2019s like \u2014 we\u2019re going where the demand is, right? So that same sort of view of continuing to make sure, having those larger deals that will continue to layer in is the strategy and really no change there because that\u2019s the demand, right? And we need to be focused on where clients are buying. And then again, what I would say on the \u2014 how things might layer in. CEOs are actually focused on how do I succeed regardless of the level of uncertainty.\n\nSo the conversations we\u2019re having are not, hey, what happens if the tariffs that \u2014 this gets resolved, etc., it\u2019s okay. We have a higher level of uncertainty than we did 90 days ago, and so how do we then reinvent faster, right? What do we need to shift to? CEOs, and this is not from \u2014 this has been going on for now for a few years, right? They\u2019re embracing that their responsibility is to grow regardless of what has been, in my tenure as CEO, in the last six years, a series of a lot of different events. And that\u2019s why as we think about our own business, right? We continue to anchor on the characteristics that have allowed us to be the leader over these different cycles, that\u2019s the deep client relationships. Our top 100 clients we\u2019ve been with for over 10 years, the diversification of geographies, industries, I do want to give a shout out to all my industry teams.\n\nThe industry groups all \u2014 we had broad based growth, but it allows us for that diversification as well as types of work and then the all-important ecosystem relationships and our leadership in Gen AI and technology. Those are the building blocks of our resilient business and we all, our CEOs and ourselves have to be agile to succeed in whatever market and that is what our range reflects. The fact that we took the bottom off of the range reflects our belief in our resilient model as we continue to navigate.\n\nDarrin Peller: That\u2019s really helpful, Julie. Just a quick follow-up would be on AI, again on DeepSeek, just given the developments. I mean, has there been more of an emphasis around it just given the ability to use even more efficient systems or just help us understand in terms of \u2014 I know you\u2019ve said before, 10% of customers might actually have the infrastructure ready. So we still have a lot of work to do to prepare. Has there been an acceleration in the momentum or is it the same as it was the last couple of quarters? Thanks again, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet: Thank you very much. We are seeing increasing numbers of clients embracing Gen AI. And really that is, in our view, DeepSeek is an interesting development. It\u2019s an example of the ongoing technology developments, but the reason they\u2019re embracing it is that they\u2019re seeing the proven value and that is why we continue to grow because we\u2019re the ones in our client base helping our clients get to that value. And you saw that in a lot of the examples we\u2019ve been giving. So there\u2019s an increasing number of clients embracing it as companies are seeing it and there is no view that you can sit back, right, and wait on this. And that two years in, is very evident in our conversations with clients.\n\nDarrin Peller: Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet: Well, thank you again for joining. Before we wrap up, I have two updates. First, as many of you know, last month, I did announce that I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Just want to let everyone know I\u2019m feeling good. My treatment is on-track and my prognosis continues to be excellent. I have received so many well wishes, including on this call and I just want to thank everyone for all of their support. It has meant a lot. I also want to thank Katie O\u2019Conor, our Head of Investor Relations. She has been an amazing partner to me and to Casey, and to now Angie for the last three years. We\u2019ve asked her to take on a very important new role as the CFO of Avanade, our joint venture with Microsoft. I know we\u2019re all going to miss her in this role and we\u2019re super excited to see Katie take on this next chapter of her very impressive career.\n\nSo thank you very much, Katie. And I\u2019m also very pleased to welcome Alexia Quadrani, who will become our new Head of Investor Relations. Alexia joins us from the Walt Disney Company, where she was the Executive Vice President of Investor Relations and Shareholder Services. And prior to that, she spent over 20 years as an Equity Analyst at JP Morgan. I know she\u2019s really looking forward to getting to know all of you in the days ahead and I\u2019m super happy to welcome her to Accenture. And finally, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We are working every day to continue to earn that trust. And finally, a huge thank you to all of our people for what you\u2019re doing every day, and I will speak with all of you next quarter.\n\nThanks again for joining.\n\nKatie O\u2019Conor: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Analysts are intrested in these 5 stocks: ( (ACN) ), ( (CCI) ), ( (NCLH) ), ( (BX) ) and ( (BFLY) ). Here is a breakdown of their recent ratings and the rationale behind them.\n\nAccenture is catching the attention of analysts with a recent upgrade from David Koning at Baird Equity Research. Despite past sluggishness due to weak IT demand and concerns over federal spending, Accenture is expected to bounce back. The company\u2019s strong managed services and potential growth from GenAI solutions are seen as key drivers. With a solid financial position and a history of outperforming during uncertain times, Accenture is poised to regain its status as a favored blue-chip stock.\n\nCrown Castle has been upgraded to Peer Perform by Andrew Rosivach at Wolfe Research, signaling a more optimistic outlook. The sale of its fiber business is expected to drive sustainable growth and improve dividend coverage. The macroeconomic environment favors defensive plays, and Crown Castle\u2019s valuation is now considered fair. The company\u2019s focus on tower operations and reduced refinancing costs are seen as positive factors for future performance.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line is making waves with an upgrade to Buy by Matthew Boss at J.P. Morgan. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, the cruise line is experiencing strong demand and no signs of weakening. The company\u2019s value and experience gap compared to land-based alternatives, along with a favorable demographic target, position it well for growth. Management\u2019s cautious tone on earnings calls is seen as prudent, and potential geopolitical resolutions could further boost the cruise industry.\n\nBlackstone Group is being highlighted as a premier investment opportunity by Brennan Hawken at UBS. The recent sell-off in Blackstone\u2019s stock is viewed as a chance to invest in a leading alternative asset manager with strong growth prospects. Despite past concerns over redemption restrictions, Blackstone\u2019s competitive position remains strong. The company\u2019s investments in distribution and product innovation are expected to drive future growth, particularly in the retail fundraising space.\n\nButterfly Network is entering the spotlight with a new Outperform rating from Andrew Brackmann. The company\u2019s innovative Ultrasound-on-Chip technology is democratizing access to imaging and expanding its market potential. With multiple growth levers in its core business and ambitious plans for homecare, Butterfly Network is positioned for significant growth. The company\u2019s valuation reflects only partial success, suggesting room for meaningful upside as it executes on its objectives.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

The operating margin for the quarter stood at 13.5 per cent down from 16.7 per cent reported in the previous quarter.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nIT services major Accenture on Thursday narrowed its annual revenue growth forecast for fiscal 2025 to 5-7 per cent, up from the previous projection of 4-7 per cent amid greater near-term revenue visibility but an uncertain business environment.\n\nAccenture's Q2 revenue declined nearly 6 per cent sequentially to USD 16.7 billion. The operating margin for the quarter stood at 13.5 per cent down from 16.7 per cent reported in the previous quarter. Accenture follows the September-August financial year.\n\nAccenture CEO Julie Sweet said in a post-earnings call that the company anticipates potential negative impact to its US federal business under the Donald Trump government as several contracts will be reviewed. Fed business accounted for 8 per cent of the overall revenue and 16 per cent of the US revenue in FY24.\n\n\"In recent weeks, we are seeing an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY25 earnings report in December. At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong and we are very well positioned with our clients because all strategies continue to lead to reinvention through new ways of working, tech, data, and AI,\" Sweet said.\n\nAnalysts believe Accenture's results reinforces the cautious sentiment in the IT industry. \"Accenture's top end of the guidance (unchanged) bakes in no recovery in discretionary spending. The results reinforce the cautious sentiment around discretionary spending in IT services, which remains constrained, particularly for smaller deals\u2026Accenture's commentary suggests that clients remain focused on cost efficiency and large-scale transformation rather than incremental IT services spending,\" analysts at Motilal Oswal said.\n\nNew bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 stood at USD 20.9 billion, a decrease of 3 per cent in US dollars and flat in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Of this, new bookings in Consulting stood at USD 10.5 billion while that in Managed Services stood at USD 10.4 billion.\n\nAccenture said it reported a \"milestone\" quarter in Gen AI with USD 1.4 billion in new bookings and approximately USD 600 million in revenue.\n\nIn terms of verticals, growth in the second quarter was led by the Financial Services at 11 per cent followed by Health and Public Services growing at 10 per cent. Products, Communications, and Resources verticals grew 9 per cent, 6 per cent, and 5 per cent YoY in constant currency, respectively.\n\nAccenture is considered a bellwether for the Indian IT services industry and it often sets the tone for the upcoming earnings season of Indian IT companies.\n\nA decline in sequential revenue growth and weak commentary from the management pulled down Indian IT stocks like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and Wipro by nearly 3 per cent in early trade on Friday. However, most of them gradually recovered from the knee-jerk reaction.\n\nAs of Friday's market close, shares of TCS were up 0.47 per cent at INR 3,579.40 on the BSE.

She stated that federal business accounts for about 8% of Accenture's global revenue and 16% of its revenue in the Americas. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has advised federal agencies to review contracts with the top ten consulting firms by compensation and terminate non-essential ones, impacting Accenture's federal services.\n\nSweet expressed that despite believing in the critical nature of their work for federal clients, the shifting government priorities and ongoing evaluations introduce uncertainty. She also mentioned that the already significant uncertainties in the global economic and geopolitical environment are intensifying, differing from the situation during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nevertheless, Sweet remains confident in the industry's strong fundamentals.\n\nInvestor concerns over the risks associated with reduced U.S. government spending overshadowed Accenture's better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue results. The company reported earnings per share of $2.82 and revenue of $16.66 billion, slightly surpassing the projected $2.81 per share and $16.62 billion in revenue, according to LSEG data.\n\nOver the past month, Accenture's stock has dropped by 22.9%, with a year-to-date decline of nearly 14.5%.

            "content": "Accenture CEO: \u2018Ongoing Uncertainty\u2019 From Trump Cost-Cutting Plans\n\n\u2018As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,\u2019 says Accenture Chair and CEO Julie Sweet.\n\n\n\nAccenture stock fell 7 percent Thursday after CEO Julie Sweet warned that the consulting giant would take a revenue hit as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s focus on trimming costs while also mentioning potential opportunities from the shifts in policy priorities.\n\nWhile Sweet said in her prepared remarks at the company\u2019s second fiscal quarter 2025 earnings call on Thursday that Accenture was very pleased with the quarter\u2019s results as Accenture continues to deliver on its strategy to return to strong growth in fiscal year 2025, she said that growth has been affected in a couple of areas with changes being put in place by the current administration. She did not mention President Trump or Elon Musk-led DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, by name.\n\n[Related: Top Distribution Execs Are Grappling With Financial Impact Of Tariffs]\n\nThe first is at Accenture Federal Services, which accounted for about 8 percent of Accenture\u2019s global revenue and 16 percent of its Americas revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue. In addition, recently, the General Service Administration has instructed all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest paid consulting firms contracting with the U.S. government, which includes Accenture Federal Services. The GSA\u2019s guidance would try to terminate contracts that are not deemed mission-critical by the relevant federal agencies. While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government\u2019s priorities evolve and these assessments unfold.\u201d\n\nThat said, changes in the federal government also present potential opportunities, Sweet said.\n\n\u201cBased on our significant experience across federal and commercial clients, we see major opportunities over time for us to help consolidate, modernize, and reinvent the federal government, to drive a whole new level of efficiency,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the General Services Administration has nixed about 1,700 consulting contracts across various federal agencies since Trump was inaugurated.\n\nThe second impact from changes in Washington, D.C., is an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, Sweet said.\n\n\u201c[This marks] a shift from our first quarter FY 25 earnings report in December,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong, and we are very well-positioned with our clients because all strategies continue to lead to reinventions or new ways of working tech, data, and AI. We are confident in executing our strategy to help clients reinvent.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by an analyst during the question-and-answer portion of the conference call about Accenture\u2019s second fiscal quarter federal business growth rate and expectations for the second half of the year, Sweet said that Accenture does not give that kind of guidance other than at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nAccenture is pleased with its second fiscal quarter performance and that it was able to update its guidance for the full year, she said.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] pleased with how our business is sufficient with the larger deals coming online, which was a very deliberate part of our strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, as you think about Q3 and the full year, it includes our current estimates and assumptions of the potential impact of Federal and the overall environment.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about potential risks to Accenture\u2019s federal revenue, Sweet declined to be any more specific.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is, what we\u2019ve been clear about is the guidance range we\u2019re giving for the quarter and for the year reflects our best view of the impact that\u2019s coming from both the slowing of new procurement actions and the assessments of the work that we\u2019re doing. And so we don\u2019t get into different pieces of it.\u201d\n\nSweet, responding to an analyst question about a possible slowdown in spending, said that the company has not seen a slowdown in the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat we commented on, which I think everyone\u2019s well aware of, is in the last few weeks there\u2019s been an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a couple of big themes around that. Obviously, tariffs, and that\u2019s a global discussion. That is not just an Americas discussion. And also consumer sentiment, which is a little bit more of an Americas discussion. And so we\u2019re really just commenting on what I think we\u2019re all seeing, and that\u2019s only been in the last few weeks. And we\u2019re already in the heart of the discussions of clients globally who are talking about it. And you\u2019re seeing, for example, in Europe, there was an announcement of, like, major spending, you know, in areas like defense, where we\u2019ve been investing, and are well positioned.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s AI Business Continues To Bloom\n\nAside from the impact of changes in the federal business, Sweet used her prepared remarks to discuss Accenture\u2019s advances in the AI business.\n\n\u201cWe had another milestone quarter in GenAI, with $1.4 billion in new bookings and approximately $600 million in revenue. \u2026 We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas with over $250 million deployed primarily across six strategic acquisitions, and we invested in our people with approximately 15 million training hours this quarter, designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills and reinvent our services using Gen AI,\u201d she said. \u201cWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 72,000 [employees], continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY 2026.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s clients continue to be focused on reinvention, and GenAI is a catalyst for reinvention, Sweeny said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re focused on building the digital core with more AI being built in, which is driving our growth, and on areas such as the customer and core operations, including supply chain and Industry X,\u201d she said. \u201cFor our clients, the twin themes of achieving both cost efficiency and growth continue. The number of clients embracing GenAI is increasing significantly, and we are starting to see some tangible examples of scale in data and AI.\u201d\n\nAccenture By The Numbers\n\nFor its second fiscal quarter 2025, which ended February 28, Accenture reported total revenue of $16.66 billion, an increase of 5 percent over its second fiscal quarter 2024 revenue.\n\nThat revenue was almost divided evenly between the company\u2019s two major businesses, with consulting revenue of $8.28 billion, up 3 percent, and managed services revenue of $8.38 billion, up 8 percent.\n\nBy industry group, Accenture reported communications, media, and technology revenue of $2.73 billion, up 3 percent; financial services revenue of $3.01 billion, up 7 percent; health and public service revenue of $3.61 billion, up 8 percent; produces revenue of $5.05 billion, up 6 percent; and resources revenue of $2.26 billion, up 1 percent.\n\nAmericas revenue rose 9 percent year-over-year to $8.55 billion.\n\nAccenture also reported GenAI new bookings of $1.4 billion.\n\nThe company also reported GAAP net income of $1.82 billion or $2.82 per share, up from last year\u2019s $1.71 billion or $2.63 per share.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nLooking ahead, Accenture expects revenue for its fiscal third quarter 2025 to be in the range of $16.9 billion to $17.5 billion. For full fiscal 2025, Accenture expects revenue growth in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent. The company also expects full year earnings to be in the range of $12.55 to $12.79 per share, or 5 percent to 7 percent growth over adjusted fiscal 2024.\n\nAccenture also expects to invest about $2 billion to $3 billion in acquisitions in all of fiscal year 2025.\n\nDavid Harris contributed to this report.",

The S&P 500 lost 0.22%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was mostly flat and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.33%. Accenture shares dropped 7.3% after the firm warned of cuts in contracts with the U.S. government. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.43%, its first loss in five days. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed unchanged as the Bank of England on Thursday held its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.\n\nPrices in Japan ease\n\nJapan's headline inflation rose 3.7% year on year in February, easing from a two-year high of 4% seen in January. Core inflation, which excludes prices of fresh food, was at 3%, lower than January's figure of 3.2%. However, the figure was higher than expectations of 2.9% from economists polled by Reuters. The inflation figures come shortly after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady Wednesday.\n\nTrump's interest rate demands\n\nHours after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it was keeping interest rates unchanged, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy.\" Trump in January said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately,\" though he didn't follow through on the threat.\n\nEU postpones U.S. tariff\n\nThe European Union will delay implementing its first set of tariffs on goods from the U.S. until the middle of April to allow for additional time for discussions with Washington, an EU spokesperson told CNBC Thursday. \"The change represents a slight adjustment to the timeline and does not diminish the impact of our response, in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion [$28 billion],\" they noted.\n\nSales weighed down by tariffs: Nike\n\nNike on Thursday warned that sales in its current quarter will drop by a double-digit percentage as the sneaker giant contends with \"geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations,\" Matt Friend, Nike's finance chief, said in a conference call with analysts. Pessimistic guidance aside, Nike beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter.\n\n[PRO] Global markets outperform U.S.\n\nMajor U.S. benchmarks have been struggling since the start of 2025: The Nasdaq Composite is in correction territory while the small-cap Russell 2000 is at the edge of a bear market, a fall of 20% or greater from a recent high.

Although policymakers maintained their projections for two rate cuts this year, Fed officials struck a cautious tone about inflation and the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 slid 0.2%. The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, while the Dow ended the session with a loss of less than 0.1%.\n\nAccenture (ACN) stock tumbled 7.3%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the professional services firm missed sales and profit estimates for its fiscal second quarter. Julie Sweet, CEO of the consulting firm, noted a negative revenue impact from the Trump administration's focus on reducing government spending. Heading into the earnings release, analysts at Jefferies and Morgan Stanley had cut their price targets on Accenture stock, citing a cautious outlook among the firm's clients and softness in discretionary spending.\n\nResearch and advisory firm Gartner (IT) also faces headwinds related to government efficiency measures and spending cuts. On Wednesday, UBS analysts lowered their price target on Gartner stock, noting that a choppy business environment could weigh on revenue growth for the services provider, particularly in its government-facing business. Gartner shares dropped 6.8% today.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) shares fell 6.5%. The semiconductor maker enlisted financial services firm Macquarie Group to help with the sale of a manufacturing facility in Tempe, Ariz. In addition, Microchip announced an offering of $1.35 billion in convertible stock, prompting the ratings agency Moody's to downgrade its rating on the company's senior unsecured debt.\n\nShares of Darden Restaurants (DRI) jumped 5.8%, marking the S&P 500's top daily performance, after the parent company of LongHorn Steakhouse released results for its fiscal third quarter. Although quarterly sales fell shy of estimates, adjusted earnings matched forecasts, and Darden's CEO said the company expects customers to continue spending on dining out despite the uncertain economic environment. The company also expanded its partnership with Uber (UBER), announcing a pilot program to offer Uber Eats deliveries from 10 Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen restaurants.\n\nElectronics manufacturer Jabil (JBL) posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and profits, and its shares rose 3.1%. The circuit board maker touted strength across various markets, including cloud and data center infrastructure. Jabil also lifted its full-year sales and profit guidance as robust artificial intelligence demand drives sales of its semiconductor fabrication and testing equipment.\n\nAllstate (ALL) shares gained 2.6%, notching a record high following the publication of the insurer's monthly results for February. The company estimated its catastrophe losses for the month at $92 million, a sharp decline from more than $1 billion in estimated catastrophe losses in the previous month that reflected the impact of the devastating wildfires in California. The firm also reported a slight month-over-month uptick in Allstate Protection policies in force.",

The company grew earnings per share by 7% and revenue by 6% year over year, beating Wall Street expectations.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAccenture continues to see generative AI fueling growth, with $1.4 billion in new bookings related to Gen AI in the quarter.\n\nWork for the financial services industry led the way, up 11% year over year, with health and public service revenue also up 10%. Overall, Accenture has 32 clients with quarterly bookings of greater than $100 million, a reflection of the company's importance to its customers. Work in the Western Hemisphere led the way, up 11% year over year, while Europe revenue climbed by 8% and Asia-Pacific, Accenture's smallest region, was up just 1%.\n\nAccenture has generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow in the first six months of its fiscal 2025, and shareholders continue to be big beneficiaries of that cash. So far in fiscal 2025, the company has repurchased about $2.3 billion worth of shares and recently increased its dividend payout by 15%, with dividends totaling $1.9 billion so far this year.\n\nImmediate Market Reaction\n\nAccenture does not tend to be a volatile stock and usually does not see dramatic swings in the premarket, but investors seem to like what they see in the results. Shares of Accenture were up about 3% in premarket trading following the release after being up less than 1% heading into the announcement.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAccenture narrowed the low end of its full-year fiscal 2025 guidance, projecting earnings of between $12.55 and $12.79, up from $12.43 to $12.79, and revenue growth of 5% to 7%, up from 4% to 7%.\n\nThe company recorded $20.9 billion in new bookings in the quarter, a healthy 1.3 times what it billed in the previous year's quarter. Though that bookings number is down about 3% from a year ago, it is flat when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Accenture committed more than $6 billion to acquisitions in order to build its tech prowess and take advantage of the AI revolution. The latest results suggest that investment is paying off, setting Accenture up for more gains in the quarters to come.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nFull earnings report\n\nInvestor relations page\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Professional services firm Accenture (ACN) is set to announce its results for the second quarter of Fiscal 2025 tomorrow. ACN stock has declined over 12% year-to-date, primarily due to delayed employee promotions, potential cuts in government contracts, and broader economic uncertainty affecting client spending. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2.81 per share, representing a 1.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nMeanwhile, revenues are expected to grow by 5.2% from the year-ago quarter to $16.63 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views Ahead of ACN\u2019s Q2 Earnings\n\nAhead of Accenture\u2019s Fiscal Q2 earnings, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman lowered the price target on ACN stock to $370 from $425, while keeping a Neutral rating.\n\nThe analyst expects revenue to come in higher than estimates but does not see Accenture raising its full-year outlook due to economic worries and issues in its federal government services business. BMO noted that the stock looks more attractive after its recent pullback, but it expects earnings estimates to remain \u201crange bound\u201d in the near term.\n\nSimilarly, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev lowered the price target on ACN to $398 from $428 but rates the stock as Outperform. The analyst remains optimistic about Accenture but sees some risks ahead of its Q2 earnings. Key concerns include a delay in expense growth recovery, a slight dip in IT job trends, and increasing worries about how the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) might affect government IT budgets. Due to these factors, the analyst lowered the 2026 earnings estimate to $14.20 per share.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate a Large Move\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry, the Options tool does this for you.\n\nIndeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting a 6.96% move in either direction.\n\nIs ACN a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, ACN has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and four Hold ratings assigned in the last three months. At $399.31, the average ACN price target implies 23.22% upside potential.\n\nSee more ACN analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

View our editorial policy here.\n\nThe ever-increasing cunning of cybercriminals is the driver of yet another collaboration this week. Accenture has teamed up with CrowdStrike to help businesses simplify their cybersecurity approach. The two companies have developed a unified platform that combines various detection and response tools. Thus, companies can now funnel all their security through one system rather than juggling multiple solutions.\n\nThe partnership combines Accenture\u2019s security expertise with CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform, which includes cloud security, identity protection, and next-generation SIEM technology. This will result in better security operations, threat management capabilities, and AI workload protection\u2014all while keeping costs down. Organizations can spot threats in real time, fortify their prevention measures, and address vulnerabilities more quickly.\n\nThe collaboration is essentially designed to make cyber defense less of a headache for businesses \u2013 throwing them a life vest in a sea of security alerts.\n\nLeaders speak to security challenges\n\n\u201cCybercriminals are infiltrating organizations with alarming sophistication and unprecedented speed,\u201d said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead, Accenture Security. \u201cTo combat this, we work closely with organizations to understand their unique cybersecurity needs and tailor solutions to address their specific challenges. By combining our expertise with CrowdStrike\u2019s technology, we can help clients adopt a more proactive and efficient approach to digital defense.\u201d\n\nAs companies continue to move to the cloud and use AI in earnest, they\u2019re drowning in data that their old security systems can\u2019t handle. Security teams are getting overwhelmed trying to spot and respond to threats effectively. They are often stuck juggling outdated tech while constantly switching between different security tools that don\u2019t work together. All this slows down their ability to protect the business and its customers from attacks.\n\n\u201cCustomer demand for Falcon platform adoption, cybersecurity consolidation, and SOC services expertise is driving our market-moving Accenture partnership,\u201d said George Kurtz, founder and CEO, CrowdStrike. \u201cAccenture\u2019s deep expertise with the Falcon platform and SIEM transformation have directly assisted organizations in upleveling their cybersecurity programs from device to cloud to datacenter.\u201d\n\nKurtz goes on to say that Accenture plays a key role in guiding organizations to embrace the AI-native SOC, \u201cleaving legacy SIEMs, point products, and manual SOC operations behind for automated, resilient, and machine speed cybersecurity platform controls.\u201d\n\nKey areas of focus\n\nThe Accenture-CrowdStrike partnership focuses on three key areas:\n\nSecOps Modernization: Streamlines security workflows by integrating threat prevention, detection and response using CrowdStrike\u2019s Next-Gen SIEM.

The AWS Cloud Institute is structured around a comprehensive 12-course training program, which encompasses on-demand digital learning, live instructor-led courses, game-based learning, over 100 interactive labs, two capstone projects, and preparation and exam vouchers for two AWS Certifications.\n\nThis educational endeavor is significant, considering the rising demand for skilled cloud professionals worldwide. Recognizing this need, AWS, alongside Accenture, has customized the program for the markets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This localized version features nine courses as opposed to the original twelve, combining both e-learning and live sessions, and adding over 150 interactive labs, two capstone projects, as well as preparation materials along with the exam vouchers.\n\nThe partnership focuses on addressing and alleviating the skills gap prevalent in the tech industry, especially within the cloud sector. Uwem Ukpong, Vice President of Global Services at AWS, stated: \u201cThis announcement marks a significant step in our commitment to fostering the next generation of cloud professionals. By partnering with Accenture, we are able to leverage our combined expertise to deliver a world-class training program.\u201d Ukpong emphasized the mission to empower individuals within these countries through enhanced career opportunities.\n\nAccenture\u2019s role is pivotal, as the firm will provide its LearnVantage platform, which facilitates the training sessions and ensures high-quality instructional delivery. Kishore Durg, Global Lead of LearnVantage at Accenture, shared insights on the program\u2019s importance, noting: \u201cThis program will equip professionals with the skills and knowledge they need to forge new career pathways...Our global delivery capabilities and deep expertise will...ensure learners receive structured, high-quality education.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration is another step reaffirming both companies' dedication to bridging the skills gap within cloud technology, which is increasingly seen as central to future workforce needs. Accenture was recognized as the Middle East\u2019s number one cloud consulting firm based on client feedback and performance metrics in 2024, reinforcing their capacity to deliver effective educational experiences.\n\nOverall, the AWS Cloud Institute promises to be pivotal for aspiring cloud professionals, offering both foundational knowledge and hands-on experience through its rich curriculum. The integration of such training programs is likely to instigate significant shifts within the local job market and equip individuals not only with the skills necessary to thrive but also the certifications needed to validate their expertise.",

            "content": "With the demand for healthcare services growing daily because of an aging population and an explosion in chronic disease, experts are predicting huge shortages of nurses and significant shortages of physicians, in the coming years. Fortunately, a new survey finds that generative AI (artificial intelligence) is a set of tools that senior leaders of patient care organizations are planning to implement broadly in order to help address issues such intensifying clinician shortages.\n\nIndeed, the survey of 300 c-suite patient care organizations by Accenture offers some hope for the future. That report, entitled \u201cGen AI amplified: Scaling productivity for healthcare providers,\u201d and authored by managing director Tejash Shah, M.D., and senior managing director Kaveh Safavi, M.D., J.D., of Accenture Global Health, find that fully 77 percent of those leaders surveyed are hoping that generative AI will deliver significant productivity gains, even as 83 percent say that employee efficiency is a top priority.\n\nShah and Safavi identify four key elements that will be required for generative AI adoption to succeed in patient care organizations:\n\n\u00d8 Building a reinvention-ready digital core. \u201cScaling gen AI requires a robust digital infrastructure,\u201d they write. \u201cHealthcare providers need to prioritize cloud integration, data accessibility and governance to support organization-wide AI activities.\u201d\n\n\u00d8 Strengthen data quality and strategy. \u201cHigh-quality, centralized data is a prerequisite for reliable gen AI output,\u201d the authors write. \u201cA robust data foundation enhances predictive analytics\u201d to fuel clinical and operational uses.\n\n\u00d8 Prioritize responsible and secure AI deployment. \u201cAs gen AI\u2019s role in healthcare grows, securing data privacy and ensuring responsible AI use are moare more important than ever,\u201d the authors emphasize.\n\n\u00d8 Forge strategic partnerships to accelerate innovation. \u201cIn-house resources alone cannot drive scaled gen AI,\u201d they insist. \u201cStrategi collaborations with technology leaders, academic institutions and service providers offer essential expertise, support and the ability to stay at the forefront of gen AI advancements.\u201d\n\nSo what are the biggest opportunities for generative AI in patient care organizations? Among survey respondents, 83 percent cited \u201cincrease employee efficiency,\u201d 82 percent said \u201cdrive revenue growth,\u201d while only 18 percent cited \u201cincrease market share,\u201d and only 17 percent said \u201cimprove medical decision making.\u201d\n\nAnd which outcomes do executives anticipate will be most positively impacted by the implementation of generative AI? The two overwhelming answers from survey respondents are \u201crevenue growth\u201d (82 percent) and \u201cproductivity gains\u201d (77 percent).\n\nAnd the report\u2019s authors cite \u201cfive imperatives for a reinvention strategy\u201d: \u201clead with value; understand and develop an AI-enabled, secure digital core; reinvent talent and ways of working; close the gap on responsible AI; drive continuous reinvention.\u201d",

            "content": "Uber ended 2024 with its strongest quarter ever, posting 20% year-over-year revenue growth of $12 billion in Q4 \u2013 due in no small part to Uber Advertising.\n\nSince launching in 2022, Uber\u2019s advertising business has grown significantly.\n\nBut \u201cbuilding a business inside a business\u201d isn\u2019t easy, said Megan Ramm, head of the Americas for Uber Advertising.\n\nAlthough Uber Advertising was growing rapidly, its ad sales process was manual and fragmented. Customer data was stored across multiple systems, and it was hard to keep up with advertiser demand.\n\nUber had already been working with Accenture Song, the tech arm of consulting group Accenture, across various parts of its business. After the advertising division was established, Uber quickly expanded the relationship and enlisted Accenture Song\u2019s help in streamlining the new business.\n\nWhen Accenture first stepped in, \u201ca lot of the sales time was being used in ways that weren\u2019t directly focused on the client,\u201d Matthew Corbin, Accenture Song\u2019s global growth lead, told AdExchanger.\n\nBut by automating processes like billing, booking and campaign measurement, Corbin said, Accenture Song has been able to clear the road for growth.\n\nAutomation over administration\n\nUber Advertising first started operating in a handful of countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and several within the Latin America region.\n\nIts advertising clients were limited at first to restaurants, but soon grew to include consumer packaged goods, retail marketers and nonendemic advertisers outside of the Uber and Uber Eats ecosystem.\n\nWorking in so many different markets and with \u201ca wide array of advertisers with very specialized and disparate needs\u201d can cause operational inefficiencies, Ramm said.\n\nRamm estimates that account management and administrative duties previously took roughly 50% to 60% of the sales team\u2019s time. Now, she said, it\u2019s been \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d to under 50%.\n\nUsing Salesforce Media Cloud, along with some of Uber\u2019s internal generative AI tools and proprietary technology, Accenture Song helped Uber\u2019s advertising business move or automate more than 100 different processes \u2013 including billing, campaign setup, optimization and reporting.\n\nIntroducing more automation has helped Uber Advertising increase the speed of its ad sales process by 70%. \u201cBasically, every metric has improved,\u201d Ramm said, from the number of active advertisers to the penetration of net new advertisers and new global markets.\n\nAdding value to the end consumer\n\nNow that the Uber Advertising workflow is more streamlined, the ad sales team can focus on shortening its \u201cbook-to-bill\u201d ratio \u2013 meaning the amount of time between when a brand client begins a campaign and when that campaign generates revenue for Uber.\n\nTo personalize campaigns, Uber uses signals from the nearly 33 million average trips per day completed through its app, as well as location and purchase data from grocery stores, convenience stores and restaurants listed on Uber Eats. This data can be married with first-party data sets to help capture net new customers outside of a brand partner\u2019s existing customer base.\n\nUber also does a lot of testing to make sure its personalized ads don\u2019t come off as too creepy and favors \u201cadditive\u201d ads like grocery store coupons, said Ramm.\n\nUsing a combination of relevant location data and practical value propositions, Uber can ensure that the personalized ads actually register with the user, rather than fading into the background.\n\n\u201cWe all know that banner ads and noise dancing all over the place doesn\u2019t work,\u201d added Corbin. \u201cSo having experiences tied with data, and with really driving value to the end consumer, is critical.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other AI news updates investors should not miss.\n\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping the job market in ways not seen or heard before. Right from creating new roles in AI development, data analysis, and related fields, it\u2019s also accelerating the automation of routine tasks and leading to job displacement in certain sectors, necessitating workforce adaptation and reskilling.\n\nAccording to McKinsey Research, corporate use cases of AI could result in an additional $4.4 trillion in productivity gains over the long run. While AI has enormous long-term potential, its immediate benefits are uncertain. Nevertheless, 92% of businesses intend to boost their investments in AI over the next three years.\n\nA good chunk of the investment is going towards recruiting and poaching talent with advanced AI skills that could be of great benefit to the business. As businesses in almost every sector adapt their hiring processes to adopt the technology, data from job ads indicates that roughly one in four U.S. IT jobs listed are for workers with artificial intelligence expertise.\n\nSimilarly, AI accounted for 36% of IT positions listed in January in the information sector, including many tech companies making significant investments in AI development and deployment. Businesses in the professional services and financial sectors, including banks and consulting firms, seek IT personnel with experience developing or utilizing AI models and algorithms.\n\nOpen IT positions are becoming more and more AI-focused in sectors that comprise a smaller portion of the tech-hiring landscape. For instance, just a small percentage of healthcare job posts are tech-related, but the proportion of new tech positions in January that dealt with AI was almost double that of a few years prior.\n\nAccording to Thomas Vick, senior regional director at recruiting company Robert Half, employers are mostly seeking someone with expertise or experience integrating AI into existing positions. Between the end of last year and the release of ChatGPT in the fourth quarter of 2022, new AI-related jobs increased by 68%, while tech postings decreased by 27%, affirming how advanced technology is changing the employment landscape.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds in Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

The consensus estimate for revenues is $16.6 billion, indicating 4.9% year-over-year growth.\n\nTwo consensus estimates for earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 moved north in the past 60 days versus three southward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2025 bottom line has increased marginally in the past 60 days.\n\nACN\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 2.7%.\n\nAccenture PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAccenture PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Accenture PLC Quote\n\nLower Chance of Q2 Earnings Beat for ACN\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Accenture this time around.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nReinvention Partnerships to be ACN\u2019s Key Driver in Q2\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Accenture witnessed its clients prioritizing large-scale transformations and considering the company to be their reinvention partner of choice. This strategy was fruitful in terms of bookings, as the company clocked it to have reached $18.7 billion, increasing from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $18.4 billion. Bookings included 30 clients, with quarterly bookings surpassing $100 million.\n\nAccenture\u2019s emphasis on being the reinvention partner is a vital element of its strategy for achieving stronger growth. This reinvention partner strategy plays an important role in ACN\u2019s growth plan. We anticipate the company to increase bookings to $23.1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. ACN will witness top-line growth from these large bookings throughout the year. Accenture\u2019s relationships with its clients positions it to gain from higher discretionary spending.\n\nACN\u2019s Stock Comparison With Peers\n\nThe stock has lost 8.3% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s 12.5% fall and the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s 4.4% decline. Shares of its industry peers Realbotix Corp. XBOTF and Stem, Inc. STEM have risen 91.6% and 26.5% over the same period, respectively.\n\nThree-Month Price Performance\n\nAccenture\u2019s Investment Considerations\n\nThe GenAI market is expected to expand, witnessing a CAGR of 37.6% from 2025 to 2030. Accenture, being at the forefront to leverage GenAI, is anticipated to benefit from this market expansion. ACN\u2019s partnerships with OpenAI, Sanctuary AI, and more have solidified the company\u2019s position in the GenAI market. These collaborators provide access to AI models and solutions, allowing Accenture to develop solutions tailored to specific enterprise requirements.\n\nACN\u2019s expertise in the GenAI domain drove $3 billion in GenAI-related bookings in fiscal 2024 and $1.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We anticipate improvements in bookings due to Accenture\u2019s ability to capitalize on the GenAI market expansion.\n\nMeanwhile, Accenture has an asset-light business model with low CapEx and high FCF, facilitating frequent acquisitions. The company spent $6.6 billion across 46 acquisitions in fiscal 2024, demonstrating its inclination toward boosting performance by buying out companies.\n\nTherefore, we can expect ACN to acquire more companies in the process of improving its AI services and expand in the market. In doing so, Accenture might face the risks of overpayment or making bad buyouts, mainly in the current turbulent AI market.\n\nHold on to ACN for Now\n\nAccenture is well-positioned to leverage the GenAI market expansion, wherein partnerships that enable the company to improve its AI offerings will attract more clients. This strategy, coupled with ACN\u2019s reinvention partnership strategy, will help it win more clients, thereby boosting the top line.\n\nWhile acquisitions to boost AI offerings are common for ACN, they do not guarantee improved performance, and carry the risk of overpayment and bad investment choices. Hence, we recommend investors to remain patient and monitor Accenture\u2019s ability to navigate within the AI market, which should be instrumental in making investment decisions.\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

            "content": "In a series of videos, the man responsible for the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans discussed planning to kill his family and having dreams that helped inspire him to join ISIS, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more, posted five videos on Facebook in the hours and minutes leading up to the attack, Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nJabbar, a Texas-born US citizen and Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, made reference in the videos to his divorce and how he had at first planned to gather his family for a \u201ccelebration\u201d with the intention of killing them, two officials who had been briefed on the recordings said.\n\nBut Jabbar said in the videos he changed his plans because he wanted news headlines to focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said. Jabbar stated he had joined ISIS before this summer, Raia added.\n\nThe videos, which CNN has not reviewed, were posted on Jabbar\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday between 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m., Raia said. Jabbar also planted two improvised explosive devices in the hours before the attack, which took place about 3:15 a.m.\n\nJabbar was killed while exchanging fire with police after ramming the truck through the crowd in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. He had an ISIS flag in the truck he drove, according to local and federal authorities.\n\nFrom military vet to terrorism suspect\n\nNow, law enforcement authorities are reviewing the videos, as well as phones and laptops potentially linked to Jabbar, as they rush to piece in details about how he went from a military veteran to a suspect in a deadly rampage.\n\nHis family is also trying to understand where he went wrong. Jabbar was born and grew up in Beaumont, Texas, and his brother Abdur Jabbar, 24, and his father, Rahim Jabbar, 65, told CNN they couldn\u2019t reconcile the attack with the kind, soft-spoken person they knew.\n\n\u201cHe was very well-tempered, slow to anger,\u201d Abdur said in an interview in their home in Beaumont. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so unbelievable that he would be capable of something like this.\u201d\n\nAbdur, who spoke with his older brother almost daily over the last year and half, said he thought there must have been a mistake when a relative first told him Jabbar had been identified as the suspect. But then he saw his brother\u2019s face plastered on the news.\n\nThe brothers were raised Muslim and regularly attended a mosque on Friday nights while growing up, but Jabbar never spoke about ISIS or showed any signs of radicalization, Abdur said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never shared anything like that or of that nature with me,\u201d Abdur said. \u201cHe understood what it meant to be a Muslim\u2026 It wasn\u2019t this tragedy. It was the complete opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling us,\u201d Rahim added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going through something that we knew of.\u201d\n\nJabbar served in the Army for more than a decade, an Army spokesperson told CNN. He served as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist on active duty between March 2007 and January 2015, and deployed to Afghanistan once from February 2009 to January 2010, the spokesperson said. After leaving active duty in January 2015, Jabbar served in the Army Reserve until July 2020, when he left service as a staff sergeant.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar works in Fort Johnson (formerly Fort Polk), Louisiana, on November 16, 2013. - 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division/Reuters\n\nServing in the military, Jabber said in a 2020 YouTube video pitching himself as a real estate agent, had taught him \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s to make sure that things go off without a hitch.\u201d The video has since been taken offline. In the video, he sat next to a framed poster with the word \u201cDiscipline\u201d in bold, and near a book titled \u201cLeadership.\u201d\n\nJabbar received an associate degree from Central Texas College in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in 2017, according to an online resume. Both degrees were related to computer science and information technology. He later worked in business development and data engineering at the consulting firms Deloitte and Accenture, according to the resume.\n\nGeorgia State University confirmed to CNN Jabbar attended from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems. Central Texas College and Accenture did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Deloitte said Jabbar served in \u201ca staff-level role since being hired in 2021.\u201d The company is assisting in the investigation and \u201cwe are shocked to learn of reports today that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJabbar obtained in 2019 a real estate license that expired in 2023, according to records from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The records show he took a range of real estate classes on topics such as contract law and finance between 2018 and 2021. He is also listed in public records as having previously registered or being associated with several companies in Texas and Georgia.\n\nContentious divorces and run-ins with the law\n\nJabbar had divorced twice, court documents show. His first wife sued him in 2012 over child support soon after he filed for divorce, and the court ordered him to pay amounts that increased over the years as his income grew. The case was dismissed in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, a Texas judge granted Jabbar\u2019s second wife a restraining order against him during their divorce case. The order mandated Jabbar to refrain from threats, physical harm, or other stipulated behavior against his ex-wife and either of their children. It required her to avoid the same behavior. In a court filing, Jabbar\u2019s ex-wife stated the marriage had become \u201cinsupportable because of discord or a conflict of personalities.\u201d\n\nJabbar had previously had several run-ins with the law. Harris County court records also show that he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft of between $50 and $500 in December 2002, and served nine months of \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he pleaded guilty to charges related to driving under the influence while serving at Fort Bragg, a North Carolina military base, now known as Fort Liberty, according to court records. The documents revealed Jabbar was under the influence of an impairing substance in November 2014 and recorded a blood alcohol level over the legal limit. They also showed that he was driving with \u201can open container of alcoholic beverage after he consumed alcohol.\u201d\n\nJabbar was charged with Level 5 DWI \u2013\u2013 the least severe level of the offense in North Carolina. According to the documents, he had his driver\u2019s license suspended, was placed on probation for 12 months, fined $200 and complied with 24 hours of community service.\n\nThe FBI released Shamsud-Din Jabbar's passport photo. - FBI\n\nIn recent years, Jabbar appears to have struggled with his finances. In a January 2022 email filed as part of his divorce case, he wrote that he could not afford a mortgage payment on his house, which he said was more than $27,000 past due and \u201cin danger of foreclosure\u201d if his divorce settlement was further delayed.\n\nJabbar also stated in the email that a business he had formed, Blue Meadow Properties, had lost about $28,000 the prior year, and that other businesses he formed weren\u2019t worth any money. He added that he had incurred about $16,000 in credit card debt.\n\nA rented truck\n\nJabbar rented the truck he used in the New Year\u2019s attack, a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, on the car rental website Turo, which lets owners rent their vehicles to other people. The truck\u2019s owner confirmed to CNN in a text message that it was rented on Turo.\n\nJabbar picked up the truck on December 30 before driving from Houston to New Orleans the following day, Raia said. Mumtaz Bashir, a neighbor of Jabbar\u2019s in Houston, told CNN he saw Jabbar load up the truck on the morning of December 31, and that Jabbar told him he was moving to New Orleans for a new job.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he needs hands for moving, help him out, as a neighbor, do you need any help moving things around? He said, \u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019\u201d Bashir said. Jabbar appeared to be loading light, handheld items into the truck, he said.\n\nBashir, who said he was shocked and \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the attack, described Jabbar as a nice but quiet person who minded his own business. Bashir said he never saw any kind of \u201cred flag\u201d that Jabbar had been radicalized.\n\nThe rental site was also linked to an incident in Las Vegas involving a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside a Trump Hotel Wednesday. The driver of the Cybertruck died in the explosion, police said. Authorities have not confirmed the name of the dead driver and are investigating whether the incident was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d a Turo spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTuro disabled the truck linked to the New Orleans attack for renting on Wednesday morning. Before it was disabled, the vehicle was listed as costing $105 a day, excluding taxes and fees, and it was unavailable to rent until 12:30 p.m. central time on Wednesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera, Ashley Killough, Evan Perez and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story was updated to include new information on the suspect.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

            "content": "Analyst Bryan Bergin of TD Cowen maintained a Buy rating on Accenture (ACN \u2013 Research Report), reducing the price target to $394.00.\n\nBryan Bergin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that suggest Accenture\u2019s performance will remain strong despite some market uncertainties. He anticipates that Accenture\u2019s second-quarter results will surpass market expectations, which could lead to slight increases in revenue and EPS growth projections for the fiscal year 2025. Although there is some concern over policy changes under the Trump administration, Bergin believes these will not significantly impact Accenture\u2019s growth in the near term.\n\nBergin also notes that while there is elevated fear in the market, particularly in the Services sector, Accenture\u2019s shares are currently undervalued, trading at a discount compared to their five-year average. He acknowledges some risks related to foreign exchange and potential policy impacts in fiscal year 2026, but he views these as manageable. The stable outlook and strong bookings are expected to provide some relief to investors, supporting his Buy rating for the stock.\n\nIn another report released on March 10, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $415.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

It\u2019s been very hard for people to migrate to new technologies.\u201d\n\nAccenture is positioned to be a crucial partner for CrowdStrike in this regard, Bernard noted, given that the global system integrator was behind implementations of the prior-generation SIEMs for many large customers.\n\n\u201cWho put in the SIEMs of yesteryear? Accenture. So they're very familiar with the space,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd what our customers need is migration of data from legacy SIEM to next-gen SIEM.\u201d\n\nIngestion of other third-party data for use with CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Next-Gen SIEM is another opportunity for a service provider partner like Accenture, he said. Thus, \u201cthere is a broader data strategy that Accenture is leading.\u201d\n\nSecurity, Cost Benefits\n\nKey advantages with CrowdStrike\u2019s Next-Gen SIEM approach include improved security outcomes through providing a modernized approach that makes full use of cloud-native technologies and AI, according to Bernard.\n\nThe CrowdStrike offering also provides greater efficiency \u2014 allowing the system to be managed with fewer security professionals \u2014 as well as a lower overall cost, he said.\n\nWithout a doubt, the requirements around migration of data and deployment of such a powerful system are \u201cdriving the need for partner services\u201d such as from Accenture, Bernard said.\n\nThe reality for customers, according to Thexton, is that they need help from trusted partners to update their security operations practices with a modernized system such as CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Next-Gen SIEM.\n\n\u201cThese are complex integrations, and these are mission-critical systems for our clients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey want someone that's been there and done that before at that scale \u2014 and I think that's what we bring to the table,\u201d Thexton said.\n\nUltimately, he said, CrowdStrike and Accenture are \u201clooking at an opportunity to drive significant automation at scale with the combination of the two companies \u2014 which I don't think can be matched.\u201d",

The Scottish-headquartered firm will boost Accenture\u2019s capital projects capabilities, and boost its headcount by more than 200.\n\nBased in Glasgow, Scotland, Soben works for leading global hyperscalers and co-location providers on major data centre construction. Since its launch in 2011, Soben\u2019s services have expanded to include project management consultancy, scheduling, project controls, cost and commercial management, consultancy and advisory, and carbon cost management. With a team of 250, the company serves clients in Western Europe (UK, Germany, Scandinavia, Netherlands), the US, Mexico, Brazil, India and Australia.\n\nThis has attracted the attention of Accenture, which is looking to build capacity to meet the needs of clients addressing challenges with major capital projects. At present, only 6% of organisations deliver projects on time or ahead of schedule, according to the firm\u2019s research, while two-thirds miss their budgetary targets. By adding Soben to its ranks, Accenture hopes the added expertise in data centre development and the pharmaceutical and energy industries will boost it\u2019s capital projects capabilities in advisory as well as project, cost and commercial management for clients.\n\n\u201cThe market for capital projects and especially data centres is growing rapidly, driven by ever-higher demand for cloud computing and AI and exponential data growth,\u201d said Steve Roberts, senior managing director, Accenture Industry X. \u201cHyperscalers and co-location companies are under tremendous pressure to deliver on this demand. They need a provider that brings data centre expertise plus proven capital projects experience, which is what the combination of Soben and Accenture will stand for.\u201d\n\nThe move will see Soben\u2019s 250 employees join Accenture\u2019s infrastructure and capital projects practice within Industry X. The move follows the 2024 acquisitions of BOSLAN, a management services provider focused on net-zero infrastructure in Spain, and IQT Group, a provider of engineering managed services for large infrastructure projects, based in Rovigo, Italy.\n\n\u201cWhen we started Soben in 2011, our vision was to disrupt the construction consultancy marketplace, and we have now established Soben as one of the key players for capital projects in Europe and North America,\u201d added Scott Smyth, CEO at Soben. \u201cBy joining Accenture, we can realize that vision and offer fantastic opportunities for our people to grow their careers.

Its services include project management consultancy, scheduling, project controls, cost and commercial management, consultancy and advisory, and carbon cost management. With a team of 250, the company serves clients in Western Europe (UK, Germany, Scandinavia, Netherlands), the US, Mexico, Brazil, India and Australia. They will join Accenture\u2019s infrastructure and capital projects practice within Industry X.\n\nOrganizations developing capital projects are facing a long list of challenges, new research from Accenture shows, ranging from increased scrutiny from stakeholders to supply chain issues to staffing shortages to cybersecurity risks. As a result, only 6% of the 700 organizations surveyed deliver projects on or ahead of schedule. Two-thirds miss their targets, adding an average of 29% in labor costs and penalty fees to the bill.\n\nThese challenges are particularly affecting companies looking to expand existing or to build new data centers. The market is experiencing hypergrowth, particularly in the US, Europe and the Middle East, where Accenture estimates an annual spend of more than $200 billion for the next 3-5 years. Soben will strengthen Accenture\u2019s capabilities for clients to address challenges when planning and executing data center development and modernization projects.\n\n\u201cThe market for capital projects and especially data centers is growing rapidly, driven by ever-higher demand for cloud computing and AI and exponential data growth,\u201d said Steve Roberts, senior managing director, Accenture Industry X. \u201cHyperscalers and co-location companies are under tremendous pressure to deliver on this demand.

Together, Accenture and Soben bring leading minds in capital projects expertise and emerging technology together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we started Soben in 2011, our vision was to disrupt the construction consultancy marketplace, and we have now established Soben as one of the key players for capital projects in Europe and North America,\u201d said Scott Smyth, CEO at Soben. \u201cBy joining Accenture, we can realize that vision and offer fantastic opportunities for our people to grow their careers. We\u2019re looking forward to bringing Accenture\u2019s global reach and digital capabilities to our clients to help them scale their business fast and deliver exceptional outcomes for their capital projects.\u201d\n\nWith Soben, Accenture continues to grow its infrastructure and capital projects capabilities globally and in Europe. The company started scaling this business in 2023 with the acquisition of advisory and management company Anser Advisory in the US, and consulting and program management company Comtech in Canada. In 2024, it added BOSLAN, a management services provider focused on net-zero infrastructure in Spain, and IQT Group, a provider of engineering managed services for large infrastructure projects, based in Rovigo, Italy.\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.

            "content": "Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos have successfully convinced the Energy Department to rethink its choice of Accenture Federal Services for a potential $3.5 billion enterprise IT support contract.\n\nAccenture is the incumbent on the Chief Information Officer Business Operations Support Services blanket purchase agreement, known as CBOSS. Energy uses that pact to acquire enterprise IT and business support service.\n\nEnergy awarded the CBOSS 2.0 recompete to Accenture on Jan. 17, then Booz Allen and Leidos filed their protests in late January. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims joined the protests into a single case on Feb. 4.\n\nOn Monday, Justice Department attorneys representing Energy filed a motion to let the case go back for reconsideration. That sealed filing is listed as a \u201cconsent motion,\u201d which means both the agency and the protesters support the motion.\n\nThat does not mean Energy will change its mind on the award, but appears to have seen something in the protests that raised potential issues with the source selection decision.\n\nWith the motion, the protests are paused to give Energy a chance to take a second look. Leidos and Booz Allen can come back to the court if they disagree with whatever action Energy takes to address its concerns.\n\nMost of the filings are sealed, but the court has released redacted versions of Booz Allen\u2019s and Leidos\u2019 complaints.\n\nFrom what we can see, Booz Allen and Leidos argue that Energy did not follow the solicitation when it evaluated proposals and that resulted in a higher score for Accenture.\n\nAccenture\u2019s proposal came in at a lower price than Booz Allen and Leidos, who claim Energy did not evaluate the realism of Accenture\u2019s pricing. They also argue that Accenture\u2019s low price reflects a lack of understanding of the requirement.\n\nOne phase of the competition called on the companies to respond to a hypothetical task order for an IT infrastructure library, which is a collection of best practices for IT service management.\n\nBooz Allen alleges in its complaint that Accenture proposed a \u201csignificantly reduced, underskilled staff approach to the ITIL requirement.\u201d Accenture is essentially accused of lowering the seniority and skill levels of its labor mix, plus slashing salaries.\n\n\u201cThese risks should have been, but were not, assessed against the Accenture technical proposal, undermining the decision to award to Accenture,\u201d Booz Allen writes in its complaint.\n\nLeidos raises nearly identical allegations in its complaint.\n\n\u201cHad the Agency evaluated Accenture\u2019s proposal consistent with the terms of the Solicitation, it would have recognized that Accenture\u2019s low level of effort creates significant risk,\u201d Leidos writes in its complaint.\n\nThe companies also allege that the agency misevaluated their technical proposals.",

            "content": "Consulting.us\n\nAs the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk is now on a mission to cut contracts with consultancies that the Trump team considers wasteful. That crusade has now been directed at firms like Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture, and government agencies like the General Services Administration (GSA).\n\nIn just the first two months of the new Trump administration, there has been more than a triple-fold increase in the number of consulting contracts canceled. These contracts were for services with different parts of the federal government.\n\nJust last week, DOGE gave several agencies just a few days to justify their contracts with 10 large consulting firms. It is not clear what assessments or actions might follow that deadline.\n\nMajor consultancies, long under scrutiny for huge invoices at the expense of federal agencies, have gone damage control. In moves made apparently to appease the Trump administration, Accenture announced it was ending its DEI programs and Deloitte told employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures.\n\nMcKinsey, for their part, have already been largely black listed from any US federal government contracts after being force to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in various legal settlements related to their work in promoting highly-addictive opioid medications for Purdue Pharma. The firm was also grilled by members of congress for their work with the government of China.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\nPerhaps no other consultancy stands to lose as much as tech and digital transformation firm Booz Allen Hamilton. The firm relies on the US government for 98% of its contracts, which range from national park web services to defense industry cybersecurity tools.\n\nCEO Horacio Rozanski of Booz Allen Hamilton said in a recent interview that the firm functions more as a tech company than a consultancy, perhaps in an effort to distance the firm from the negative perceptions surrounding consultancies.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton stock has dropped by around 30% since Trump took office in January, though it has rebounded a bit since the beginning of March.\n\nThe GSA\n\nSince Trump\u2019s inauguration, DOGE has taken over the GSA, the government\u2019s procurement arm. It is now headed by Trump-appointed software entrepreneur Stephen Ehikian.\n\nAfter Trump and Elon\u2019s takeover, around 200 employees resigned or were fired from the GSA, a serious staffing issue that could negatively affect everything from passport applications to public health.\n\nSteven Reilly, the engineering lead for the main text messaging platform built for government agencies, notify.gov, resigned in February from the Technology Transformation Services arm of the GSA after the branch\u2019s new director tried to gain access to the notify.gov website.\n\nMusk \u2018deletes\u2019 new tax filing system\n\nOne major blow to the Technology Transformation Services division of the GSA has been the disbanding of the digital agency known as 18F. The team included designers, software engineers, and more who collaborated with other agencies to improve public service through technology.\n\nThis team had been working with federal agencies since 2014 and was recently developing a streamlined online system for Americans to file taxes more easily and free of charge. That new digital service for paying taxes, called Direct File, is now likely to be scrapped.\n\nAround 90 employees of 18F were immediately locked out of their devices after an announcement from the GSA that their jobs were deemed \u2018non-critical\u2019, according reporting from Reuters.\n\nFiling taxes is notoriously complicated for Americans, many of whom rely on paid third party tax services to crunch the numbers. By all measures, the move to scrap Direct File appears to be a clear move away from \u2018government efficiency\u2019: In this case, the goals of 18F actually appeared to align with the alleged goals of DOGE.\n\nMusk appears to have had a previous gripe with 18F. Earlier this month he called the group a \u201cfar-left government-wide computer office\u201d in a reply to a post on X. He added that the group has been \u201cdeleted.\u201d",

Place nominations before Jan. 31.\n\nAccenture Song had two things to show me, both tucked into the corner of a building where the non-profit thinktank SeedAI was hosting an AI showcase at SXSW in Austin, TX.\n\nThe first was in a small, silver room with a single computer.\n\n\u201cWhen our lawyers saw this, they told us not to release it,\u201d said Justin Durazzo, immersive design director at Accenture Song.\n\nInside the room, the monitor took a snapshot of my face. I was prompted to speak three different sentences, each with an increasing level of emotion. I watched a three-minute video hosted by Kyle Vorbach, who directed the 2024 documentary How I Faked My Life With AI, talking briefly about deepfakes.\n\nAnd then, I was shown surveillance footage of me acting sketchy in a hotel, and a social media video of me throwing a tantrum in a cafe.\n\nWhat\u2019s increasingly alarming about deepfakes is how quickly and easily they can be created\u2014and not just of celebrities with libraries of film, photos, and audio to sift through\u2014but of everyday citizens using minimal input.\n\nThe exhibit was called \u201cMeet Your Digital Maker,\u201d built by Accenture Song and its Droga5 agency, to showcase First AI-ID Kit, an initiative that debuted at CES 2025 to help people protect themselves against deepfake attacks.\n\nThe videos didn\u2019t replicate me perfectly. Accenture Song\u2019s head of innovation and executive creative director Maria Devereux told me the tech could make something with much more fidelity with a little more time and a few more assets.\n\nBut the point of the exhibit was to show how quickly and easily the tech could create a deepfake. Three minutes was the minimal amount of time to create something passable and the tech is just going to improve in the coming years.\n\nThe second part of the exhibition, which debuted at SXSW 2025, took place in a phonebooth (\u201cIt was really hard for us to get a hold of one of these,\u201d Devereux told me), where I had a conversation with an AI chatbot about how I felt about deepfake technology.\n\nIt listened to me answer a few questions, and then the AI chatbot\u2019s voice became my voice.\n\nOr at least, an approximation of it. The cadence was a little off and the speech seemed to have the hint of an accent that I definitely don\u2019t have, but the point was the speed at which my voice could be stolen and repurposed.\n\nI listened to myself claim to be in trouble and beg for money.\n\nEven if the voice wasn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s still another tool in a scammer\u2019s arsenal. My grandmother fell victim to this 15 years ago, when someone claiming to be my cousin called saying he was in jail, and asked her to wire money, which she quickly did. It was that easy already, and imagine how a synthesized voice of someone you know might make it even easier.\n\nThe two demos for Accenture Song\u2019s First AI-ID Kit are meant to be used by the public and by clients for educational purposes around deepfake training, and the company is considering building more demos.\n\nBut it\u2019s already deemed the technology too dangerous for general availability.",

            "content": "Sreevishnu has been missing since 10 December. The police reportedly told the family that his mobile phone was last traced to Amritsar in Punjab. (Supplied)\n\nSynopsis: Sreevishnu of Pathanamthitta in Kerala last contacted his home on 10 December before going missing from Gurugram, southwest of Delhi. An employee of Accenture, he was to visit home in February, and the family\u2019s efforts to trace him have so far gone in vain.\n\nSreevishnu contacted his family in Kerala\u2019s Pathanamthitta district over a video call on 10 December, and spoke for about two hours.\n\nThe 28-year-old man disconnected the call, saying he had to go to work. That was the last his family at Parakode, Pannivizha in Adoor, heard from him.\n\nAccenture, the company for which he worked as a supervisor, contacted Sreevishnu\u2019s family the next day. The firm asked about his whereabouts, and the family tried to contact him. His mobile phone was switched off.\n\nMonday, 10 March, marked three months since Sreevishnu contacted home. His family, meanwhile, tried all possible means to trace him. All went in vain.\n\nAfter receiving the reported call from Accenture, Sreevishnu\u2019s father, CS Manoharan, lodged a complaint with the Palam Vihar Police in Haryana\u2019s Gurugram, southwest of Delhi.\n\nSreevishnu, his family said, had been living in a rented accommodation in Sector 17, Gurugram.\n\n\u201cThe police keep saying that they are investigating but we have not received any concrete updates,\u201d Sreevishnu\u2019s relative Biju GS told South First.\n\n\u201cHis parents and sisters are devastated. He wanted to be with his family and had even planned a visit in February. But the investigation has been far from satisfactory,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: Rising youth crimes heat up debate on violence in films\n\nFamily seeks help\n\nDesperate for any leads, the family sought the intervention of political leaders, including MPs Anto Antony, NK Premachandran, Kodikunnil Suresh, and Union Minister Suresh Gopi.\n\nHowever, despite their efforts, the case has remained unresolved.\n\nSreevishnu\u2019s elder sister, Sreelekshmi, said there were no signs of work-related stress before his disappearance.\n\n\u201cHe spoke to us via a WhatsApp video call on 10 December afternoon for nearly two hours. Later, he messaged us saying he was getting ready for work and would leave his lodge soon,\u201d she told South First.\n\nSreevishnu, the family said, was on the night shift.\n\nSreelekshmi, however, flagged a suspicious request for money made that same day, 10 December.\n\n\u201cThe lodge owner (in Gurugram) told us that he had received a WhatsApp message from Sreevishnu asking for \u20b910,000. But when he called him to ask why he needed the money, his phone was already switched off,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was unusual. If he needed money, he would have asked me or my twin sister Sreeparvathi,\u201d she said.\n\nThe family added that no other requests for money came from Sreevishnu or anyone else.\n\nPhone traced to Amritsar\n\nInvestigators reportedly traced Sreevishnu\u2019s mobile phone movement to Amritsar, Punjab. His phone records showed he travelled to Delhi\u2019s Kashmere Gate, a major interstate transport hub, some 34 km Gurugram\u2019s Sector 17.\n\nApart from tracing his phone\u2019s presence in Amritsar, there have been no further leads. Sreevishnu\u2019s family said his belongings remained untouched in his rented apartment.\n\nSreevishnu had moved to Sukhrali, Gurugram, three years ago after securing an IT job through an online search.\n\nHis work model was hybrid\u2014he attended the office twice a week and worked remotely the rest of the week. His family said he was expecting a promotion and had assured them of a visit home soon.\n\nFriends join probe\n\nWith the police investigation appearing to be at a standstill, the Alumni Association of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in Pathanamthitta, where Sreevishnu studied, has intervened.\n\n\u201cA group from the JNV Pathanamthitta Alumni Association is set to meet the Haryana state police chief on Tuesday,\u201d Sreelekshmi said. \u201cWhen we asked if a family member needed to be present, they assured us they would contact us if required.\u201d\n\nWith each passing day, the family\u2019s concerns have been deepening even as their frustration with the authorities grew.\n\n\u201cIt has been three months, and we are still left in the dark. We just want to know what happened to Sreevishnu,\u201d Biju said.\n\nThe family demanded a thorough and urgent investigation into his disappearance, fearing that crucial time has already been lost.\n\nLetter from Accenture\n\nSreevishnu\u2019s family also accused Accenture of negligence in handling his disappearance.\n\n\u201cThey were the first to inform us that he was missing, but after that, they never followed it up,\u201d Sreelekshmi said.\n\nShe revealed that on 19 February, the company sent a letter addressed to Sreevishnu, stating that he had been absent from work since 10 December.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they had tried reaching him at all available addresses and that this letter was their final attempt. They warned that if he didn\u2019t report back by 28 February, his service would be terminated,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen the family questioned why the company had not lodged a police complaint, Accenture reportedly responded that since he had gone missing outside office hours, it was not obligated to do so.\n\nAccenture\u2019s response, as claimed by the family, could not be independently verified.\n\n(Edited by Majnu Babu).",

            "content": "Each week, Benzinga\u2019s Stock Whisper Index uses a combination of proprietary data and pattern recognition to showcase five stocks that are just under the surface and deserve attention.\n\nInvestors are constantly on the hunt for undervalued, under-followed and emerging stocks. With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance of information to uncover new opportunities and understand why certain stocks should be of interest.\n\nRead Also: EXCLUSIVE: February\u2019s 20 Most-Searched Tickers On Benzinga Pro \u2013 Where Do Tesla, Palantir, Alibaba, Nvidia Rank?\n\nHere's a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week ending March 7:\n\nBarrick Gold GOLD: The gold company saw increased interest from Benzinga readers during the week. The biggest reason for the increased attention was likely a UBS analyst upgrade on the stock going from Neutral to Buy with a $22 price target. Benzinga recently shared that the company is getting closer to resolving a dispute in Mali, an item that has hurt the company's financials. Gold stocks could also be seeing increased attention from investors as a possible hedge against tariffs and growing macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe stock was up 3% over the last week as shown on the Benzinga Pro chart below and shares are up 17% over the last year.\n\nAlamos Gold Inc AGI: Another gold stock seeing increased attention from Benzinga readers during the week was Alamos Gold. The company recently reported a record 2024 performance and predicted that production growth will grow 24% annually through 2027 with continued expansion. The company's fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue each beat Street consensus estimates. The company has now beaten earnings per share estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters and revenue estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nRealty Income Corporation O: The real estate investment trust saw strong interest from readers during the week. The company recently reported fourth-quarter financial results with adjusted funds from operations per share up 4% year-over-year to $1.05, falling shy of analyst estimates of $1.07. The company owns or holds interest in more than 15,000 properties and pays a monthly dividend, which could be a reason for the increased interest. Investors could be looking for investment income and high dividends to offset concerns from tariffs and macroeconomic concerns.\n\nHoneywell International HON: The industrial company saw increased interest from Benzinga readers during the week, which could be related to recent financial results and an acquisition. Honeywell announced a $2.2 billion deal to acquire Sundyne from Warburg Pincus. The acquisition will expand Honeywell's industrial equipment portfolio. Honeywell has now announced $9 billion in acquisitions since December 2023.\n\nThe company recently announced it would separate into three business units as part of a portfolio transformation. The move will include tax-free spinoffs for shareholders.\n\nHoneywell's fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share beat analyst estimates. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in more than 10 straight quarters. Honeywell's revenue has beaten analyst estimates in four of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nThe stock traded flat on the week and shares are up around 6% over the last year.\n\nAccenture Plc ACN: The IT Services company saw strong interest from readers during the week, which comes after it announced acquisitions and ahead of quarterly financial results. The company announced the acquisition of Denmark-based AI company Halfspace. The acquisition is expected to boost the company's presence in the Nordic and European regions and boost the company's overall AI capabilities. Halfspace, which was founded in 2015, develops AI solutions and products that can be used by companies. Accenture is also acquiring Altus Consulting, a company that provides advisory services. The acquisition is expected to add to Accenture's insurance division and boost its presence in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccenture will report second-quarter financial results on March 20. Analysts expect the company to report revenue of $16.63 billion, up from $15.80 billion in last year's second quarter and earnings per share of $2.82, up from $2.77 in last year's second quarter. The company has beaten estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

The 10 major firms whose contracts with the government are now under review include Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture, General Dynamics, Leidos, Guidehouse, HII Mission Technologies Corp, Science Applications International Corporation, CGI Federal, and International Business Machines Corporation, according to Business Insider The list of 10 firms earns billions of dollars a year performing outsourced tasks in contracts with different federal agencies. They are usually hired to advise the federal government on how to asses as well as advise the government on how to perform its functions better.Deloitte, in the 2024 financial year, earned just 9 percent of its revenue from contracts with the government. Consulting firms like Booz Allen Hamilton, however, heavily rely on contracts with the government.The consulting firm separated from its private sector consulting arm in 2008 and nearly all its revenue comes via government contracts at around $11 billion. Leidos Holdings is a consulting firm that provides technology for national security purposes. Many of the consoling firms work directly with the Defense Department.According to the Wall Street Journal , Executives from Booz Allen, Ernst and Young, as well as other major consulting firms met with the Trump administration in recent weeks in an attempt to convince the administration to not cancel their contracts with the government.The firms are being asked to \"defend the spend,\" and explain why their services are key to the goals of the Trump administration. Josh Gruenbaum, the Federal Acquisition Service commissioner in the General Services Administration (GSA) said, \u201cThe private sector provides incredible products that help make the government better. We value their partnership, which is why we\u2019re meeting with them. We welcome them working with us to decrease our excessive government spending while continuing to provide the essential services the government needs.\u201dGruenbaum, however, stressed that the meetings with the consulting firms are needed because of the debts the United States has accrued over time.",

Or how do you really calculate the return on organizational change?\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that it was \"an absolutely correct criticism\" that consultants work with urgency but not efficiency and that the industry was \"due for disruption.\"\n\n'Good value'\n\nBI spoke to a senior leader in Deloitte's GPS division who defended the firm's work.\n\n\"We're constantly striving to bring good value and show value because that's how we then win additional work,\" the senior leader said.\n\nThe leader understood the notion that there was inefficiency or bloat in federal spending and argued that consultants brought greater efficiency to the government.\n\n\"We're consistently showing, we implemented this new tool \u2014 it saved you 5,000 hours this year \u2014 or we identified X amount in cost or over burns or fees or whatever it is.\"\n\nThe Deloitte leader said the value came from bringing industry and technology expertise that the government didn't always have.\n\nBoth Mische and the Deloitte GPS leader thought that the contract reviews wouldn't necessarily lead to a significant loss of business for consultancies but rather a shift in the focus of work.\n\nThe Deloitte leader said departments such as climate and transportation have reason to feel uneasy, but those in data and AI \"might feel very bullish that things are going to pick up\" given the Trump administration's focus on automation and AI.\n\nHe thought there would also be a temporary rise in opportunity thanks to consultants having to step in as \"Band-Aids\" in place of federal employees who had been let go.\n\nHave a tip?

Despite recent macroeconomic volatility and concerns about discretionary spending, Kupferberg anticipates Accenture\u2019s upcoming financial results to align with expectations and supports the company\u2019s long-term revenue guidance. The company\u2019s previous guidance increase and its status as a leading IT services provider, along with its potential to benefit from advancements in generative AI, reinforce the positive outlook.\n\nWhile there are concerns about global discretionary spending and specific risks related to federal contracts, Kupferberg views these as manageable. The recent Supreme Court decision unfreezing payments to federal contractors is seen as a positive development. Additionally, Accenture\u2019s strong bookings, particularly in consulting and managed services, further support the Buy rating. Kupferberg remains selective in the IT services sector, favoring industry leaders like Accenture that are well-positioned to gain market share regardless of broader economic uncertainties.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Goldman Sachs also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $430.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

But now, employees working in these consulting divisions are bracing for what could be massive disruptions, as per Business Insider. While Deloitte US receives $3.3 billion annually through its contracts with federal agencies, which is about 9.6% of its latest annual revenue, reported Business Insider.The General Services Administration (GSA), the primary arm responsible for federal procurement, has asked federal agencies to review and justify their ongoing contracts with these firms, reported Business Insider. Agencies have been given until Friday to provide a list of which contracts are essential and which could be cut, as per the report. This move is part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to combat what it sees as wasteful spending.At firms like Accenture and Deloitte, staff are feeling the pressure. Many employees have reported increasing job insecurity, as these firms face intense scrutiny over the value they bring to government projects, according to Business Insider. Consultants at Accenture Federal Services, for example, shared their concerns anonymously, revealing that the company recently cut back on \"bench time\", the period between projects, meaning that employees now face layoffs if they are not immediately assigned to new work, according to Business Insider.An employee from Accenture claimed, \u201cEveryone is worried that their job will be next, and nobody knows when it's going to end. We already have fewer projects and expect more to get cut,\" as quoted by Business Insider.Deloitte, a firm that receives a significant portion of its revenue from US government contracts, is also feeling the impact. Employees in its Government & Public Services division have described a tense atmosphere, with projects being pulled and little new work available. One employee noted, \"There really isn't a lot of work available to apply for,\" as quoted by Business Insider, adding that workers felt \"it was best to leave government consulting and return in a few years when things have settled,\" according to the report.DOGE's review of government contracts is focused on evaluating the actual value consultants bring to federal operations, as per the report. Doug Collins, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, criticized wasting money on tasks like creating PowerPoint slides and taking meeting minutes, announcing a $2 billion cut in contracts, reported Business Insider.Michael Mische, a former KPMG partner and USC professor, acknowledged that consultants do play a valuable role but noted the challenge in measuring the return on their work, especially for long-term strategies or organizational changes, as per the report. He agreed with the criticism that \"consultants work with urgency but not efficiency\" and also mentioned that \"the industry was due for disruption,\" as per Business Insider.The DOGE is reviewing 10 consultancy firms like Deloitte, Accenture Federal Services, and Booz Allen Hamilton, among others.Agencies must review and justify their contracts with consulting firms, identifying which ones are essential and which could be cut.

These contracts are awarded to address specific needs the government may not be able to fulfill internally due to lack of expertise, resources, or time. The services offered through these contracts cover a wide range of areas, including management consulting to improve efficiency, IT consulting for technology solutions, policy advisory for developing and analyzing regulations, legal and regulatory consulting, and financial consulting for budgeting and audits.\n\nConsulting contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process and often involve specialized knowledge that helps the government carry out its mission. These contracts play a key role in helping the government solve complex problems, implement new technologies, and ensure efficient operations.

That\u2019s according to Scott Alfieri, the global leader of Accenture\u2019s massive Google Business Group that consists of tens of thousands of employees dedicated to driving Google sales for the $71 billion company. \u201cYou are now able to select Gemini from [Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce]\u2019s drop-down so that when you\u2019re building AI agents\u2014let\u2019s say it\u2019s in the contact center, which is where a lot of our work is\u2014you\u2019re now using the generative AI engine and R&D investments that are realized around the world from Google to allow agents to be utilizing the best LLMs that exist in the marketplace that are multimodal,\u201d said Alfieri. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited for customers.\u201d Agentic AI represents a $2 trillion market opportunity, according to a recent study from Salesforce. From Google Workspace with Gemini benefits to more easily providing AI agents to Accenture\u2019s massive customer base in more than 120 countries, Alfieri is bullish that the teaming of Salesforce and Google will be a boon for solution providers in the AI era. [Related: Salesforce Launches AI Agents Marketplace] \u201cYou\u2019ve now got this extensibility that will happen between Salesforce and Google with Vertex AI and then the other platforms that come with Google Cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we think about where Salesforce plays and where Google plays in the market, it\u2019s just this beautiful complementary matchup.\u201d Accenture is investing heavily in AI in 2025. This week alone, Accenture acquired AI provider Halfspace, which helps businesses leverage and scale AI to make better, more-informed decisions. Accenture also this year invested in Aaru, the creator of a leading AI-powered prediction engine that simulates consumer behavior and preferences. Accenture is a 20-time Google Cloud Partner of the Year award winner, thanks in part to Alfieri\u2019s leadership, which includes over 30 years working at Accenture. In an interview with CRN, Alfieri explains why Accenture and the channel should be bullish about Google Cloud and Salesforce\u2019s new $2.5 billion partnership in the AI era.\n\nGoogle Cloud And Salesforce Is An Agentic AI Home Run Salesforce and Google Cloud\u2019s $2.5 billion deal over the next seven years will see the two tech companies integrate their AI and CRM tools, linking the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure with Salesforce's AI-powered Agentforce assistants, CRM software and Data Cloud capabilities. Salesforce is adding Gemini to its Agentforce platform, meaning all Salesforce customers can begin using Gemini to power their AI agents. Alfieri said Accenture will be leveraging Google\u2019s Gemini models on Agentforce, allowing agents to work with images, audio and video and handle more complex tasks using Gemini\u2019s multimodal capabilities and two-million-token context windows. \u201cWe\u2019re now taking both of our kits, if you will, to bring those together to now create acceleration positions in these initial movements between Google and Salesforce,\u201d he said. With the offer using real-time insight and answers grounded in Google Search with Vertex AI, Accenture will help clients capitalize on this partnership by providing packaged accelerators to drive growth and reinvent business workflows and customer experiences. \u201cWhat matters is those first client meetings where you\u2019re talking about how Google and Salesforce will work together and how Accenture can bring them through to a business reinvention journey,\u201d he said. Google\u2019s Gemini models will also be available for prompt building and reasoning directly within Agentforce.\n\nOne Boosted Use Case: Real-Time Voice Translation Salesforce\u2019s customer service platform, Service Cloud, is now more tightly integrated with Google\u2019s own Customer Engagement Suite. This will enhance AI-enabled contact center capabilities including real-time voice translation, personalized agent recommendations and AI-driven conversational insight across all channels. Alfieri said Google Cloud\u2019s AI in Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud will enable real-time voice translation that breaks down language barriers. \u201cAllowing translation capabilities is very important. So that\u2019s a unique differentiator for Google in terms of the language translation that you\u2019re able to bring forward that\u2019s enabled with Gemini and Vertex AI,\u201d said Alfieri. For example, he said customer care representatives can receive AI-powered assistance in multiple languages and automated case summarization. \u201cAnother example for health care, you can be building agents and then call Gemini. Then from there, Google has their medical large language model\u2014MedLM\u2014you can now be using that in specific medical or health-care-specific use cases or industry and functional positions.\u201d In addition, new agent assist features within the Service Cloud desktop will analyze tone of voice and audio cues for deeper customer sentiment understanding.\n\nGoogle Cloud Marketplace Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, Data Cloud and Customer 360 apps will run on Google Cloud infrastructure, with access to new regions and simplified procurement through the Google Cloud Marketplace. This means that organizations can begin deploying Salesforce offerings through Google Cloud Marketplace. Alfieri said this synergy on Google\u2019s online marketplace opens the door to new possibilities for global businesses to optimize their investments across Salesforce and Google Cloud with Accenture. \u201cThe Marketplace allows [customers] to capture the innovation of the world,\u201d Alfieri said. \u201cThrough the marketplace, we\u2019re publishing specific Accenture intellectual property-controlled agents for both industry and function\u2014all built on Google Cloud.\u201d Alfieri said with customers\u2019 ability to procure and deploy Salesforce solutions via Google\u2019s online marketplace, it \u201cjust makes it easier for everybody.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just excited to do much more around the Google Cloud Marketplace as we go through 2025,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkspace Gemini Adoption With Slack Google Cloud and Salesforce said they are creating better ways to integrate Slack and Google Workspace products, like Google Chat, to easily communicate across platforms. The two companies are exploring the ability for users to use enterprise search in Slack to access and act on files in Google Drive. Another goal is the ability to more easily share information between Gmail and Slack, enhancing communication and knowledge sharing. Alfieri said this will enable Salesforce customers to leverage the power of Gemini and Workspace after Google Cloud this year made Gemini available free of charge for clients with Business and Enterprise subscription plans. \u201cWorkspace and Gemini are now all one,\u201d said Alfieri. \u201cWe had built a value accelerator of how generative AI can impact a client in the Workspace world, but now it\u2019s just one motion. So it\u2019s actually a more efficient and singular conversation with a client.\u201d Accenture is particularly excited to leverage Workspace\u2019s digital sovereignty technology for its Salesforce customers. \u201cFor Workspace, it\u2019s not just about collaborations, it\u2019s about how can this be about business reinvention and business change,\u201d Alfieri said.",

            "content": "Accenture has revealed its Technology Vision 2025 report, focusing on the emergence of AI-powered autonomy as a significant force in business and technology development.\n\nThe report suggests this new era of digitisation, characterised by AI's continuous learning capabilities, will drive unprecedented levels of autonomy within organisations. As AI becomes an integral component of enterprises and society at large, trust in the technology's performance is highlighted as the key measure of success.\n\nThe Accenture Technology Vision 2025 analyses how AI's increasing role will redefine technology development, customer experiences, the physical world and the global workforce. With 70% of New Zealand executives acknowledging the urgency of innovation, the research suggests AI will become a collaborative technology partner, personal brand ambassador, and power behind robotic bodies in physical environments. Accenture also predicts a new symbiosis between AI and people, fostering mutual enhancement.\n\n\"Our 25th Technology Vision gives leaders a look into what's ahead when AI continuously learns, acts autonomously with and on behalf of people, and pushes enterprises and the people who use it into new and exciting ways to continuously reinvent,\" stated Justin Mowday, Country Managing Director, Accenture New Zealand.\n\nHe added that the full potential of AI could only be realised if trust in its capabilities and outcomes is systematically developed by business leaders. This, he claims, will enable businesses and individuals to unlock AI's full potential.\n\nTrust in AI, beyond its technical capabilities, is deemed critical for achieving its broad and positive impact. Digital systems and AI models need to exhibit accuracy, predictability, consistency, and traceability. Furthermore, 73% of executives believe AI's benefits hinge on a foundation of trust, while 74% suggest trust strategies must progress alongside technological advancements.\n\nAccenture posits that digitising knowledge, building new AI models and agent systems, and establishing cognitive digital brains through autonomous systems will drive dynamic and intention-driven organisations. However, this vision relies heavily on the trustworthiness of the systems.\n\nThe report also explores the tangible impact of generative AI as it influences various aspects of technology and business. Accenture is utilising platforms such as GenWizard, SynOps, and AI Refinery to facilitate the development of multi-agent systems, aiming to expedite the value derived from customised solutions.\n\nCompanies are in a race to integrate AI as a customer interface. Despite concerns (63%) that language models and chatbots may result in a uniform brand voice, 64% of executives believe distinct AI experiences can be crafted by embedding brand-specific elements into digital interactions.\n\nThe physical world too will see AI's influence as Accenture partners with firms like KION Group and NVIDIA to optimise AI-driven warehouse robots. Research suggests 80% of executives support the idea that human collaboration with robots, paired with continuous learning, will build trust in robotic and AI technology.\n\nAI's integration is creating a positive feedback loop, enhancing its abilities and increasing users' willingness to engage with the technology. Leaders are prioritising the relationship between people and AI, ensuring it does not succumb to automation fears, but instead maintains open communication with employees about AI strategies.\n\nAccenture has also initiated a Generative AI Scholars Program in collaboration with Stanford Online to further knowledge in AI technologies. Organisations are encouraged to empower employees with digital tools to boost proficiency in AI, noting individuals familiar with AI view it more positively.",

            "content": "Accenture\u2019s latest investment signals a shift in marketing intelligence paradigms.\u200b\n\nThe AI arms race just got a new frontrunner. Accenture Ventures has thrown its weight behind Aaru, a company that\u2019s redefining customer prediction with synthetic data \u2013 AI-powered simulations that model human behavior with unprecedented accuracy. This isn\u2019t just another AI investment. It\u2019s a signal that synthetic data is moving from the fringes of experimental tech to the core of marketing, product development and customer strategy.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nWhy this matters\n\nEvery marketer knows the pain of unreliable customer insights \u2013 surveys are slow, focus groups are flawed and real-world data is often incomplete or riddled with bias. Aaru\u2019s multi-agent AI systems claim to sidestep these issues, creating ultra-precise simulations of consumer behavior in minutes. Accenture Song plans to integrate Aaru\u2019s Lumen model across its AI suite, effectively giving brands the ability to \u201cforecast\u201d customer reactions before launching campaigns, products or services.\n\nSome might argue it could spell the end of the era where brands rely on costly, time-consuming market research methods. As Accenture Song\u2019s chief strategy officer, Baiju Shah, put it: \u201cAnticipating customers and uncovering new growth opportunities using AI-powered agents is now a strategic edge for businesses.\u201d\n\nIn short, synthetic data is shifting from being a futuristic concept to an essential tool in marketing strategy \u2013 and Accenture just made a big bet on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSynthetic data \u2013 the next big thing in AI?\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal with synthetic data? Traditionally, AI models are trained on real-world data, which can be scarce, privacy-sensitive or biased. Synthetic data solves that problem by creating AI-generated datasets that mimic real ones, without the privacy concerns or regulatory headaches.\n\nMarketers are already using synthetic data in three major ways:\n\n1. Hyper-personalized advertising: Imagine generating millions of customer personas and testing ad campaigns on them before spending a single dollar on real-world media. No more A/B testing blind spots.\n\n2. Deepfake-driven creative: AI-generated video and voice technology is allowing brands to scale content production faster than ever. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30% of all outbound marketing messages from large enterprises will be synthetically generated.\n\n3. Smarter product development: Companies can now simulate customer interactions with products before launch, eliminating misfires and speeding up time-to-market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bigger picture \u2013 is this the beginning of \u2018decision dominance\u2019?\n\nAaru isn\u2019t just another AI analytics firm \u2013 it\u2019s pitching something much bigger: decision dominance. In its own words, Aaru\u2019s technology doesn\u2019t just predict consumer behavior; it models entire populations. That means brands won\u2019t just be reacting to consumer trends \u2013 they\u2019ll be shaping them in real-time.\n\nCameron Fink, Aaru\u2019s CEO, sees this as the next major shift in AI: \u201cSimulation is an incredibly powerful tool and will be the differentiator between companies that lead the market and those that fall behind in the AI age.\u201d\n\nIf Aaru delivers on its promise, it could rewrite the rules of consumer engagement, turning marketing from a reactive game into a predictive science. And with Accenture backing it, it\u2019s only a matter of time before synthetic data becomes a mainstream marketing must-have.\n\nThe bottom line? Marketers who aren\u2019t paying attention to synthetic data now might find themselves outpaced by those who are.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other trending AI news updates driving US markets.\n\nAs the global AI race heats up, the Trump Administration\u2019s downsizing of federal agencies poses a risk to AI development in the US. His cost-cutting measures are already impacting AI research efforts. Yesterday, a key federal AI research agency witnessed layoffs and faced potential budget cuts. Several US National Science Foundation employees, with expertise in AI, were terminated, threatening the agency\u2019s ability to sustain AI research.\n\nThe government\u2019s latest move also affected the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships within the National Science Foundation. The department played a key role in funneling government grants related to AI. Industry experts heavily criticized the downsizing.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese buyers are circumventing US export curbs to acquire the latest AI chips from top US manufacturers, exacerbating Trump\u2019s challenges in cutting off the transfer of American technology to China. Washington imposed export controls in 2022 to curb China\u2019s access to semiconductors for training AI models, but underground brokers are still managing to bypass the controls.\n\n\u201cChina will help bridge the technological divide and prevent technological innovation from becoming a game for the rich countries and the wealthy,\u201d said Chinese politician and computer scientist, Lou Qinjian, at the start of the annual National People\u2019s Congress.\n\nWe selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1000 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The three operators provide regional presence, and Skylo, offering Release-17 level (5G-compatible) NB-IoT on geostationary (GEO) satellites, patches up IoT coverage in remote and rural areas where there is no terrestrial IoT infrastructure.\n\nSeparately, it has announced a cybersecurity deal to develop new enterprise cybersecurity services with Accenture.\n\nBell Canada and Telenor IoT have been announced previously; Singapore-based Singtel, adding coverage in Asia Pacific, and US startup Skylo, focused on blackspots and no-spots in the US (according to a press note), are new. The latter will be available in the \u201cnear-term\u201d, said Verizon Business. It said it expects to have 30 operator partners in due course, to expand and densify its global IoT offer. Coverage is available to enterprises, manufacturers, and developers in \u201cup to 200\u201d territories, the US carrier said.\n\nThis is enabled via both owned infrastructure and roaming deals, between the existing partners. Verizon\u2019s Global IoT Orchestration service is now commercially available to US-based customers activating eSIM profiles in IoT devices in global markets. It offers IoT fleet management via the firm\u2019s ThingSpace IoT portal \u2013 \u201con a single pane of glass using a seamless API interface or web portal\u201d.\n\nShamik Basu, vice president of strategic connectivity at Verizon Business, said: \u201cOur IoT services and platforms are designed to meet our customers\u2019 needs wherever they do business, which is all around the world\u2026 We\u2019re proud to offer an IoT capability that\u2019s expansive, mobile, and conveniently managed through Verizon ThingSpace.\u201d\n\nRCR Wireless spoke with Basu at MWC 2025; more coverage to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon Business has also announced a partnership with Accenture to \u201caccelerate the development and delivery of advanced cybersecurity solutions\u201d. They are looking to provide solutions to protect enterprises of all sizes, they said. They will begin by offering new as-a-service capabilities including \u2018identity and access management\u2019 (IAM), \u2018managed extended detection and response\u2019 (MxDR), plus \u2018cyber risk services\u2019. Following, they will look to \u201cco-innovate new solutions\u201d, they said.\n\nKyle Malady, chief executive at Verizon Business, said: \u201cCybersecurity is a top priority for businesses\u2026 We are seeing evolving demands from our customers and we are building out new cybersecurity capabilities. Partnering with Accenture will be key to scaling our capabilities and delivering new and innovative products to address our customers\u2019 most pressing needs.\u201d\n\nManish Sharma, chief executive in the Americas at Accenture, said: \u201cThe security landscape is growing more complex, driven by emerging technologies, geopolitical uncertainty, global data and cyber security regulations, supply chain risks, and a cyber skills gap. Businesses must prioritise resilience to stay ahead of evolving threats. [Together we] will enable businesses to better protect their data and operations against cyber-attacks.\u201d",

As part of this collaboration, Accenture Song intends to integrate Lumen\u2014Aaru\u2019s flagship model for the private sector\u2014into its AI products and services across new product development, marketing, customer strategy, and customer service.\n\nAaru\u2019s unique approach to prediction uses multi-agent AI systems to create simulations of human behavior with greater precision based on proprietary and public data sources.

In addition, Baiju Shah, chief strategy officer of Accenture Song, will become a strategic advisor to Aaru as the business continues to scale.\n\n\"With 85% of CMOs saying it\u2019s more difficult than ever to stay relevant, the widening gap between what companies offer and what customers expect has created an urgency to innovate,\u201d said Shah. \u201cAnticipating customers and uncovering new growth opportunities using AI-powered agents is now a strategic edge for businesses and brands.

Advances in technology present a significant opportunity to create growth and efficiencies for this vital sector, but only if they can harness it,\u201d said Carmina Lees, Insurance lead for Accenture in the UK & Ireland . \u201cOur acquisition of Altus Consulting will accelerate our goal of helping clients to reinvent their business, building digital capabilities that enable them to better serve customers as they plan for their futures.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs several of the world\u2019s largest economies face a significant proportion of their workforce entering retirement age over the next two decades, the ability for people to prepare well for retirement is increasingly more challenging,\u201d said William Pritchett, global lead for Accenture\u2019s Retirement practice. \u201cGovernment and industry are striving to help, including providing greater access to advice and guidance, narrowing the gender savings gap and establishing innovative risk-sharing products. Altus Consulting is a trusted advisor across the insurance and investment industries, bringing relevant experience and IP to enhance Accenture\u2019s ability to address such challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy joining Accenture, we gain the resources to dramatically enhance our offering to clients, whilst maintaining the values and approach that helped us build such a strong business. The move will allow us to deliver end-to-end transformation programmes at scale, from strategy and vision right through to design and delivery,\u201d said Martyn Evans, CEO at Altus Consulting. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment for the financial services industry, particularly in insurance where there is still so much untapped potential for technology to innovate products and services. We\u2019re excited about the future and to see the impact we can make for our clients with our shared vision.\u201d\n\nAltus Consulting builds on several significant acquisitions by Accenture in recent years that have expanded its offerings for clients across the financial services sector in the UK \u2013 including BCS Consulting and Mudano.\n\nAccenture has acquired Altus Consulting from Equisoft Inc. a global digital solutions provider to the financial services industry. Equisoft Inc. retains the former Altus software business and maintains its focus on offering software products and tools within the life insurance, pensions and investments industries.\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nExcept for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

And companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte and Accenture, are among those with billions on the line.\n\nIn new guidance, the General Services Administration (GSA) ordered agencies to provide information on their contracts with the top ten firms. In a letter to agency procurement executives, acting GSA Administrator Stephen Ehikian said, \u201cWe have identified the 10 highest paid consulting firms listed below are set to receive over $65 billion in fees in 2025 and future years. This needs to, and must, change.\u201d\n\nThe list is due by March 7, and agencies must include which contracts they want to ditch and which they plan to keep.\n\n\u201cFor any contracts between these firms and your agency that will continue, please provide a signed statement from a senior official verifying that such contract is mission critical and provides substantive technical support,\u201d wrote acting administrator Ehikian.\n\nThe ten companies GSA asked agencies to focus on are:\n\nAccenture Federal Services\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\nCGI Federal\n\nDeloitte Consulting\n\nGeneral Dynamics IT\n\nGuidehouse\n\nHII Mission Technologies\n\nIBM\n\nLeidos\n\nSAIC\n\nThe letter comes after GSA sent an earlier letter asking agencies to review contracts with the above firms. Acting administrator Ehikian said \u201cnot enough action has been taken,\u201d regarding that review.\n\nOutside experts suggest that reducing government contracts is not necessarily a bad thing but warn that it must be done thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cWhile one could debate whether some of this work is necessary or nice to have, a lot more of a thoughtful approach is needed about work that if eliminated doesn\u2019t lead to gaps in government understanding, decision making and ultimately delivery of services to people,\u201d said an anonymous former GSA official to Federal News Network.\n\nBig Spenders Moving Ahead\n\nThe Department of Defense, one of the biggest spenders on contracting, laid out plans for an analysis.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the agency to \u201cconduct a comprehensive review and validation of existing contracts for consulting services\u201d with the intent of \u201cterminating or descoping contracts for activities that are not essential for the Department to fulfill its statutory purposes.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, federal agencies spent more than $500 billion on consulting related contracts from fiscal years (FY) 2019 through 2023, with DOD accounting for more than 46 percent of the total.\n\nVA Contracts Questioned\n\nOver at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the administration may have moved too swiftly and is now backtracking. The VA put the brakes on contract terminations and ordered additional reviews of the programs being cut.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that some of the 875 programs slashed helped veterans with medical services, funded cancer programs, recruited doctors, and provided burial services to veterans, according to internal VA documents.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins initially said the cuts would save taxpayers about $2 billion.\n\nSaving Money?\n\nDespite all the attention, the contract cuts may not be saving much money for taxpayers.\n\nData published by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) finds that 794 out of 2,300 contracts terminated in recent weeks, or about 40%, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nThat\u2019s typically because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, meaning the government has a legal requirement to spend the funds for the goods or services it purchased and, in many cases, has already done so.\n\nDOGE insists the canceled contracts will save nearly $10 billion, an amount questioned by independent experts.\n\nYou can track contracts terminated by DOGE at this link.",

Accenture\u2019s investment will help Aaru accelerate its growth and expand its capabilities to meet the increasing demand for AI-driven data and analytics.

            "content": "If there\u2019s a lyrical hook to describe Accenture Song, it might be Tom Petty\u2019s chorus on \u201cRunnin\u2019 Down a Dream\u201d from the seminal Full Moon Fever album.\n\nThe narrative unfolds on Petty (presumably), who is driving some metaphorical highway,\u201cworkin\u2019 on a mystery\u201d and \u201cgoin\u2019 wherever it leads.\u201d Hopefully to the aforementioned dream.\n\nWhen Accenture rebranded its interactive practice \u2013 in essence, rewriting it in a song \u2013 it was the post-pandemic halcyon days of 2022. The company was chasing new ways to reinvent customer connections and drive commerce at a time when, according to some analysts, we had experienced seven years of digital transformation in the space of a few months.\n\nGiven that hyperbolic pace, digital agencies were in a head spin, struggling to help organizations make the leap to a digital-first, multi-channel world. In the transom, Accenture saw the importance of people in the value equation. As such, it chose the \u201cSong\u201d moniker as an expression of the \u201cenduring and universal form of human craft, connection, inspiration, technical prowess, and experience,\u201d enabling imagination and ideas to deliver real results.\n\nWhat does that look like from a services perspective? For starters, it\u2019s a new paradigm for agencies that bucks the status quo \u2013 a blend of creativity, innovation, and technology that helps brands push boundaries and build relevance.\n\nAnd while this new fusion still provides the full gamut of capabilities you would expect from a creative shop, they do it with a tech-focused transformational edge. That means immersive content experiences like AR/VR, edge applications with artificial intelligence, and more.\n\nCase in point: Song recently partnered with Fortune to modernize its ubiquitous Fortune 500 list into an AI-driven platform, giving business leaders access to insights gleaned from years of data \u2013 we\u2019re talking all the way back to 1938.\n\nThis kind of ground-breaking innovation led the company to an estimated revenue of $19 billion last year, roughly one-third of parent company Accenture\u2019s nearly $70 billion in revenue.\n\nBut here\u2019s the \u201cmystery\u201d part of the chorus: Change. It\u2019s undeniable, and it\u2019s driving faster than Tom Petty\u2019s fingers on a fretboard. Based on Accenture\u2019s own research, nearly 90% of C-suite executives stated that the current needs of customers and employees are changing faster than leaders can adapt their businesses.\n\nThat means new kinds of growth models are required to keep runnin\u2019 down the dream \u2013 if we ever hope to realize it. Nowhere is that truer than in the realm of digital commerce, where Accenture Song has been writing a new tune and composing it with composable.\n\nTo put it on wax, Accenture Song has been investing in a multitude of areas to juice its data and intelligence capabilities. In 2022, they bought an outfit called Fiftyfive5, a customer insights and advisory business that helps clients tap data insights and performance marketing to accelerate growth and innovation.\n\nThen, in March of last year, they acquired Mindcurv, a cloud-native digital experience and data analytics company specializing in composable software, digital engineering, and commerce services. The purchase enhanced Accenture Song\u2019s position as a leader in composable commerce, cementing the company\u2019s composable practice in North America, Europe, and other regions.\n\nNow, the company is taking another bold step behind composability by joining the MACH Alliance, the industry group advocating for open, best-of-breed technology ecosystems.\n\nAnnounced last week, Accenture Song will become the latest member of the Alliance\u2019s certified GSI (Global Systems Integrator) cohort \u2013 an exclusive group of MACH SIs that share a sizable global influence. The Alliance bench also includes Deloitte Digital, EPAM, Publicis Sapient, Valtech, and VML.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200bAccording to Amjad Liaquat \u2013 global lead, commerce platform design at Accenture Song \u2013 MACH aligns with his organization\u2019s vision on a number of levels.\n\n\u201cAt Accenture Song, composability and the MACH paradigm are fundamental enablers of customer-centric transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cBy embracing modular architectures, API-first design, cloud-native solutions, and headless experiences, we empower brands to move with agility, innovate at scale, and craft truly differentiated experiences.\u201d\n\nChange is still a mystery, but having the right people and technology can help brands become more agile and resourceful \u2013 so they can face the unknown and thrive. As Liaquat shared, it\u2019s the combination of creativity with the flexibility of MACH that enables businesses to seamlessly adapt to evolving customer expectations, unlocking new value at the crossroads between tech and design.\n\n\u201cWith our unique ability to bring together advisory, creativity, and technology at scale, we help global clients navigate this new AI-powered world,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhere adaptability, intelligence, and human-centric experiences are the key to sustained growth and differentiation.\u201d\n\nRunnin\u2019 down the composable dream\n\nLike all its peers in the GSI and broader MACH Alliance membership, Accenture Song will be working to align with industry standards, collaborate with ecosystem leaders, and drive client-focused innovation.\n\nAs a highly visible and globally respected brand, Accenture Song will serve as an authoritative voice in composable commerce initiatives and share expertise with other members. Additionally, it has committed to growing and deepening the market\u2019s awareness of the MACH approach to composable commerce \u2013 and how MACH can help businesses to innovate.\n\nAccenture Song\u2019s involvement could also have a significant \u201clift\u201d effect, encouraging MACH adoption in a professional services category that is seeing a steady increase of adoption. This is reinforced by data gathered in the 2025 MACH Alliance Global Annual Research \u2013 a report that surveyed IT leaders across sectors. It found that over half of all companies with a \u201cmostly\u201d MACH/composable infrastructure in place have become more competitive and adapt more quickly to that mystery of change.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Accenture Song has joined the Alliance as a certified GSI member, alongside a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of world-class digital agencies and consultancies. Like all other members, it achieved its GSI status by meeting a rigorous set of criteria, which includes having more than 1,000 certified engineers, developing five MACH vendor partnerships, and working with five clients earning more than $1 billion in revenue.\n\nAs MACH Alliance president Casper Rasmussen observed, Accenture Song has shown an ability to partner with leading enterprises to deliver on the expectations of MACH \u2013 representing a high bar of achievement that only large, multi-national agencies and system integrators can achieve.\n\n\u201cAccenture Song joining the Alliance will be of value to the MACH community and the wider member ecosystem,\u201d Casper said. \u201cWe really believe that both current and future end-users will find great inspiration from the work of Accenture Song, and in particular, this experience will help them turn their strategies into high impact gameplans.\u201d\n\nWhy it matters\n\n\u201cRunnin' Down a Dream\u201d is wicked, but Tom Petty conjured a slew of memorable hits.\n\nThis one, too, might live on forever: \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d You can interpret the lyrics at your own discretion, but I've always felt it was a love song about Los Angeles wrapped in a cautionary tale about losing control.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the rapid advancement of AI or economic uncertainty, change is the big mystery we\u2019re all facing. How we prepare and adapt equips us to avoid a potential free fall \u2013 and we need vision, leadership, and a reliable set of guardrails to keep us from careening off the cliff.\n\nAs more enterprises embrace composable architectures and strategies, having reputable, large-scale SIs join the chorus of support brings greater validation to the MACH movement. On the MACH journey, many organizations rely on the proven expertise of trusted SI partners, and having global brands like Accenture in the lineup provides greater choice from a widening range of credible system integrators.\n\nWith a large staff and reliable infrastructure to support its technology and services, Accenture Song could also provide an enhanced template for accountability when building composable stacks. Like its GSI peers, it has amassed significant and compelling experience with multi-national brands and developed its own standards for success. This could mitigate more of the risk enterprises face when deploying composable architectures \u2013 which sometimes lack the proper mechanisms for supporting performance and sustainability.\n\nAmplifying thought leadership with a highly visible brand like Accenture also benefits the MACH community. As a member of the Alliance, Accenture Song has a clear charter to \u201cchampion the cause\u201d through knowledge transfer and education. With a globally recognized brand and demonstrable market leadership, Accenture Song can leverage its own internal expertise and platform to further expand the MACH messaging.\n\nAccenture (the parent company) has a longstanding culture of change. But that change is coming from every direction \u2013 and faster than ever. As Accenture Song\u2019s CEO David Droga observed in 2022, brands need to be moving at the \u201cspeed of life\u201d to remain competitive.\n\nMACH itself might seem a bit of a mystery to some. There have certainly been examples of project failures and cost overruns that have led to a \u201cMACHlash\u201d in certain quarters (or what we might call a \u201cfree fall\u201d).\n\nBut Accenture Song could bring more of what the Alliance needs from both a validation and education perspective \u2013 and ultimately give businesses what they need to start runnin\u2019 down their dreams.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nMay 13-14, 2025 \u2013 Frankfurt, Germany\n\nDon't miss the first European edition of our prestigious international conference dedicated to the global content management community!

With a market capitalization of $218.09 billion, the company offers its services globally, aiding clients to build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as \u201cmega-cap stocks,\u201d and ACN fits right into that category, signifying its substantial size, stability, and dominance in the information technology industry. Serving numerous clients in the Fortune Global 100 and the Fortune Global 500, Accenture has evolved as a trusted and viable consulting services provider through its digital, cloud & security strategy.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nHowever, the consulting giant has fallen 12.5% since hitting its 52-week high of $398.35 on February 5. Moreover, shares of ACN have declined 3.8% over the past three months, compared to the Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI) 2% decline over the same time period.\n\nMoreover, ACN shares have gained 3.3% over the past six months but declined 7.8% over the past 52 weeks. By contrast, DOWI has gained 6.7% over the past six months and 12.6% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nACN has been trading below its 50-day moving average since mid-February but above its 200-day moving average since early July.\n\nAccenture\u2019s underperformance over the past year stems from reduced client spending on non-essential services like consultancy and delayed revenue as companies shift budgets toward long-term priorities.\n\nHowever, ACN shares jumped 7.1% with its fiscal 2025 Q1 release on Dec. 19. The company reported a 9% year-over-year increase in its revenue and an EPS of $3.59, surpassing the Wall Street EPS estimates by 6.2%.\n\nIn the competitive tech sector, Accenture\u2019s top rival, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), is in the lead, with its shares gaining 27.2% over the past six months and 36.2% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts remain reasonably bullish on ACN\u2019s prospects. The stock holds a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 25 analysts covering it.

This move follows a period where global market indices experienced volatility due to uncertainties surrounding economic policies and inflation concerns. The broader market, as indicated by indexes like the Nasdaq, faced similar downward pressure, shedding 4% in February, influenced by economic data and geopolitical tensions. Accenture's partnerships, such as those with Google Cloud and KION GROUP AG, suggest a focus on leveraging AI across sectors, but these positive efforts came amid a backdrop of cautious investor sentiment. While the company's initiatives address a clear demand for innovation, they unfold against a turbulent market environment characterized by inflationary pressures and fluctuating investor confidence, leading to its modest share price movement.\n\nSee the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Accenture.\n\nNYSE:ACN Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Accenture has achieved a total return of 128.63%, reflecting substantial shareholder gains. This performance is noteworthy considering the company's recent underachievement compared to the broader US market and IT industry over the past year. Some pivotal events have shaped this longer-term trajectory. Notably, Accenture's formation of Accenture Cloud First in late 2020, with a US$3 billion investment, put a spotlight on cloud infrastructure, a key area driving tech industry evolution. This initiative likely bolstered revenue and client acquisition through cloud-based solutions.\n\nAdditionally, Accenture's commitment to shareholder value has been evident through consistent dividend increases and substantial share buyback programs. For instance, as of late 2020, the company declared a higher quarterly dividend and continued repurchasing shares, enhancing shareholder value. These financial strategies, combined with innovative collaborations, have contributed to a robust five-year performance, underscoring Accenture's capability to navigate challenging market conditions while delivering significant returns to shareholders.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving significant growth in the data center market. Analysts predict that the demand for data center capacity to support AI workloads will increase significantly due to factors like growing computing power requirements. The need to process large amounts of data and the growing adoption of AI applications across various industries should accelerate the growth.\n\nLikewise, Fortune Business Insights expects the data center market to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25.7% between 2024 and 2032. The growth comes as companies and nations prepare a massive capital deployment of $1.8 trillion from 2024 to 2030 to meet the growing demand for computing power worldwide.\n\nThe US is one of the countries spearheading the data center investment spree. As part of the Stargate project, the US is poised to play host to a $500 billion investment into data centers, which is expected to bolster the country\u2019s computing capacity to boost AI development. The first $100 billion investment is expected to come up this year.\n\nThe Stargate project is expected to give the US a strategic advantage and create thousands of jobs.\n\n\u201cAs for the 100,000 jobs the project is supposed to create? Some construction jobs will be created as the data centers are built, but many more (millions more) will be created as the data centers come online. We\u2019ve never had a compute cloud like this\u2014there\u2019s literally no way to calculate the economic impact of this amount of AI compute. It will be massive,\u201d said Shelly Palmer, a tech pundit and consultant,\n\nAmid the investment spree, there are growing concerns over a potential oversupply of data center capacity despite the ever-growing needs as part of the AI boom. Reports that Microsoft is canceling leases for US data center capacity are raising concerns about whether tech giants have secured more AI computing capacity than they needed. The software giant has already canceled data center leases totaling hundreds of megawatts, signaling it could have more capacity in its pipeline than it needs.\n\nAccording to the Kyndryl AI Readiness Report, 86% of leaders are confident in their AI implementation, but 36% cite ROI as a barrier to adoption. Data centers, the core of the digital economy, support various demanding workloads, emphasizing the need for low-latency, high-bandwidth environments for AI applications. The time to invest is now.",

            "content": "In this episode of CFO Weekly, William Washington, Global CFO of Baker McKenzie, joins Megan Weis to share his experiences regarding financial leadership, process improvement, operational efficiency, and many more. William, as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt in Finance expert, dives into the methodologies that transform operations and prepare financial teams for the AI revolution.\n\nAs a certified Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt with an MBA and Master's in Law Firm Management, William combines deep financial understanding with operational excellence principles to drive organizational success. His career spans prominent roles at global organizations, including Accenture and Fannie Mae, before finding his true calling in legal finance leadership.\n\nTranscript\n\nIn this episode, we discuss:\n\nHow the Six Sigma methodologies transform financial operations and process improvement\n\nThe unique challenges of financial leadership in law firms\n\nThe importance of authentic leadership and creating a culture where \"trying is not a failure\"\n\nWhat impact does AI have on financial operations\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nMastering Six Sigma Black Belt\n\nBecoming a Six Sigma Master Black Belt is a rigorous, stats-heavy journey that demands persistence. However, for William, it's more than just a certification; it's a mindset. His commitment to continuous improvement led him to embrace and teach Six Sigma principles, turning challenges into learning opportunities. Now, he instills this approach in his financial leadership, ensuring his team sees Lean Six Sigma not as a rigid framework, but as a powerful toolkit for identifying inefficiencies, solving problems, and driving career growth.\n\n\"Every leader on my team, every person who reports to me gets some dose of William Washington's Lean Six Sigma concepts because I want them to embrace the theory of continuous improvement in everything that they do.\" Washington noted. - 05:54 - 10:00\n\nWhy Law Firms Are Their Own Biggest Challenge\n\nLaw firms are unique because their owners are also the product. Unlike companies that sell physical goods, law firms sell knowledge and expertise, making alignment on business strategy a challenge. William highlights the importance of teaching lawyers to view their services as a product, much like an ice cream truck driver must understand their inventory, pricing, and customer demand to stay profitable. His approach? Listen first, understand their market, and help them navigate financial success as if rowing alongside them.\n\n\"One of the things I learned during my time doing Lean Six Sigma was to listen and understand the clients in the market.\" Washington commented. - 10:00 - 14:57\n\nLearning Six Sigma in Finance\n\nApplying Lean Six Sigma is a game-changer for everyday financial operations. William shares how Kaizen events and process improvements helped his team slash an 18-month budgeting project down to six months. His approach? Empower the team with the right tools, provide continuous learning, and bake improvement into daily work.

            "content": "Resilience has become somewhat of a buzzword in tech. It's something we highlight in interviews, leadership talks, and performance reviews. And while resilience is an incredible trait, when it's a daily requirement just to exist in an industry, we have to ask: Are we celebrating strength, or just normalising struggle?\n\nBefore I go further, I want to acknowledge something I hear from many men in leadership: 'I want to help, but I don't always know how.' If that resonates with you, you're not alone. Many genuinely care about fostering an inclusive workplace but feel uncertain about what meaningful action looks like. I get it. These conversations can be uncomfortable. No one wants to be told they're part of a broken system. But the reality is, you probably have worked in one. The good news? There are concrete ways to make a difference without needing to have all the answers right away.\n\nTech thrives on innovation. Yet for too long, women in leadership have been asked to persist through outdated workplace cultures instead of being given the support to succeed within them. We admire the women who have pushed through obstacles, fought burnout, and navigated industries that weren't built with them in mind. But instead of celebrating survival, shouldn't we be creating workplaces where survival isn't the baseline?\n\nResilience isn't currently being used as a growth tool. It's become a basic survival skill. And women in tech, particularly those in leadership, shouldn't have to use it every single day just to exist in the industry.\n\nBut let's talk about what really happens when we glorify resilience over fixing broken systems. Women don't just \"bounce back.\" They burn out. They leave. And in some cases, they never come back.\n\nWomen leave tech roles at nearly twice the rate of men. A study by Accenture and Girls Who Code found that half of women in tech roles drop out by the age of 35. They're not leaving because they weren't resilient enough. They're leaving because they were exhausted from constantly proving their worth.\n\nThis \"just push through it\" culture is expensive. Companies lose diverse talent, fresh perspectives, and the very people they claim to want more of. Instead of asking why women don't stick around, maybe it's time we ask: What if the problem isn't them, but the environment they're trying to survive in?\n\nAt Quickli, we've seen firsthand that when you remove unnecessary barriers, talent flourishes. And we're not alone. Across tech, leading companies are embracing key shifts that are proving to be game-changers for retention, innovation, and culture. Consider whether you could make these work in your workplace:\n\nFlexible work policies that actually work in practice and not just something leaders pay lip service to.\n\nExample: A leadership team sets clear core collaboration hours (e.g., 10 AM - 3 PM), allowing employees to adjust their schedules without guilt or career penalties.\n\nGenuine leadership support, where asking for help isn't seen as a weakness . We're working on advocating for our people instead of asking them to tough it out.\n\nExample: Managers proactively check in with employees on workload and well-being, adjusting priorities instead of expecting them to \"push through.\"\n\nRecognition of contribution over endurance. We are rewarding and celebrating impact, not exhaustion.\n\nExample: Instead of praising late-night work, leaders publicly celebrate team members who solve problems efficiently and deliver high-impact results.\n\nAnd guess what? When you build a workplace like that, you don't need to teach people to be resilient. Because the truth is they already are. They just finally have the space to do great work and unlock their full potential.\n\nAs Jen Roche, our Head of Partnerships said, \"Joining Quickli has been an incredibly refreshing experience. I'm inspired to be part of a culture where flexibility is real, leadership support is genuine and readily available, and impact is what truly matters. It's amazing to work with a team that doesn't just talk about these values but truly lives them every day\".\n\nTech moves fast. The companies that will thrive in the next decade aren't the ones that demand endless resilience, they're the ones that foster it in a way that doesn't push people, especially women, to the brink. Because too often, resilience has meant enduring unsustainable workloads and invisible labour. The future worth building is one where resilience is a strength, not a survival mechanism.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s start with the good news. As a tech-native industry, the telecommunications industry is used to integrating new technologies into its operations. The sector has over a decade of experience with artificial intelligence (AI) and as a result, machine learning and predictive AI is omnipresent in its processes.\n\nFrom that perspective, the industry is well-positioned to leverage generative AI\u2019s (GenAI) benefits. This is supported by recent research that suggests the telecom sector is ahead of the pack on GenAI spending compared to most other industries and its employees have a mostly positive sentiment towards GenAI. But here\u2019s the stinger: capitalizing on AI\u2019s opportunity is critical for telcos to survive and thrive. In most established markets, Communication Service Providers (CSPs) face stagnating revenue and margin growth and increasing debt-to-equity ratios, limiting the ability to invest for growth. Show Full Article\n\nConsequently, CSP market capitalizations have only grown by 7% since 2018 versus digital platforms\u2019 230% and S&P 500\u2019s 172%, according to S&P Global and Accenture analysis from June 2024. Even in growth markets, telcos need GenAI to manage this growth and complexity from the multi-vendor architecture, customers demanding a more personalized service and sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nUnlocking AI benefits to telecoms\n\nThe World Economic Forum has partnered with Accenture to develop a better understanding of the current state of play of AI across the sector.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked closely with a community of telecoms across regions, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other ecosystem partners, industry associations and academia to gather insights and real-life experiences, developing a consensus on emerging opportunities, challenges and key enablers.\n\nThe findings show a variety of AI use cases across different functions within telcos, of which 10 are characterized as top priorities with a high perceived readiness and impact.\n\nValue versus readinessImage: World Economic Forum/Artificial Intelligence in Telecommunications White Paper\n\nAnother set of use cases is deemed to be implementable in the next 12-18 months. These use cases promise value across four imperatives:\n\n1. Reduce the cost to serve\n\nDespite efforts to bring them down, CSPs\u2019 operational costs remain stubbornly high, at 65-70% of revenue; network operations alone will consume 50% of total operating expenses (OpEx) by 2027.\n\nGenAI can help CSPs automate repetitive, structured tasks, such as network planning applications or generating customer emails and increase process automation across IT and network management.\n\nFor example, traditional AI and GenAI can create cost-effective network designs, automate multi-vendor component integration and continuously monitor performance to detect anomalies.\n\n2. Drive business growth\n\nGenAI enables the creation of highly personalized marketing campaigns and customer journeys powered by predictive models that anticipate individual behaviours. For example, Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s Next Best Action AI Brain uses an in-house Kernel platform to revolutionize customer interactions with precise, contextually relevant recommendations.\n\nInitial implementations have shown sales increases of nearly 20% and conversion rates of around 30%. Additionally, as existing trusted infrastructure providers, CSPs can employ their assets to offer innovative services across the full spectrum of the cloud, edge compute and connectivity. This includes a potential role in providing sovereign AI services.\n\n3. Differentiate customer experience\n\nOnly 34% of telecommunications customers feel satisfied with their service and 70% are frustrated by a lack of consistent experience across channels. GenAI is transforming customer experiences with advanced conversational tools, such as natural language chatbots and AI-powered retail assistants, making every human agent a \u201csuper-agent\u201d.\n\nFor example, a European telco achieved a 40% reduction in service resolution time, a 35% improvement in customer effort scores and a 28% increase in digital channel adoption by deploying an AI-powered service automation platform.\n\n4. Secure and reliable operations\n\nThe combination of complex networks consisting of legacy components with open interface elements, the increased use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and the fact that telcos manage sensitive user data make them a prime target for state-sponsored attackers and cybercriminals.\n\nManaging these risks requires advanced AI capabilities, as AI can identify and patch vulnerabilities and analyze vast operational datasets in real time to detect security incidents and prevent fraud. For example, Bharti Airtel launched India\u2019s first anti-spam network.\n\nThe AI-powered network uses advanced algorithms to provide real-time spam protection at no cost to the customers. Processing a staggering 2.5 billion calls and 1.5 billion messages daily, it successfully identified close to 1 million spammers every day within the first two months.\n\n\u201cTo fully capture the opportunity of AI, telcos need a vision and a strategic approach to where to focus their investments and where to tap into existing and new partnerships. \u201d\n\nEvolving telcos in the GenAI age\n\nA pathway is emerging for a new type of telecommunications organization, the so-called \u201ctechco\u201d, which is increasingly automated, secure and able to provide truly personalized service to customers or expand into AI service provision.\n\nIn this scenario, GenAI provides opportunities such as truly autonomous networks, data monetization, AI-as-a-service offerings and a personal concierge concept. e& Autonomous Store Experience (EASE) offers a glimpse into this future.\n\nIt is the world\u2019s first autonomous telecom store, which uses smart gates, AI-powered cameras, robotics and smart shelves to create a frictionless shopping experience. Customers can enter with facial recognition or the e& app, shop from an extensive range of e& products and services and walk out with automatic self-checkout.\n\nTo fully capture the opportunity of AI, telcos need a vision and a strategic approach to where to focus their investments and where to tap into existing and new partnerships.\n\nFollowing that vision, successful telcos will continue to invest in foundational elements, like data architecture and automation, and upskill their workforces while building on their trusted customer relationships to drive growth and innovation.",

            "content": "CHICAGO \u2014 Snacks and confections giant Mondelez International has tapped Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon\u2019s infrastructure technology subsidiary, as its primary provider of cloud computing services.\n\nChicago-based Mondelez said the partnership will spur digital innovation across the company, with the AWS cloud infrastructure and services bringing more security, agility, cost efficiency and reliability to operations. The transition to AWS also is expected to bolster Mondelez\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, now being migrated to the SAP RISE platform powered by AWS.\n\nSo far, Mondelez said it has \u201calready migrated hundreds of workloads\u201d to the AWS cloud platform.\n\n\u201cA key focus of our growth strategy is our digital transformation,\u201d said Kostas Georgakopoulos, chief technology officer and chief information security officer at Mondelez. \u201cAWS is a strategic partner complementing our own internal cloud platform engineering capabilities to lead digital transformation across the enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe shift to AWS will accelerate the move to the SAP RISE ERP platform, which is expected to deliver improved performance, reliability, resiliency, security and AI functionality for business systems and insights, according to Mondelez.\n\nIn July, Mondelez\u2019s board of directors approved $1.2 billion in funding for a multi-year project to upgrade its global ERP and supply chain systems. Plans call for the new ERP platform to be implemented in several phases by region, with expenditures occurring over the next five years. The project is expected to be completed by year-end 2028. Mondelez is working with global IT and professional services firm Accenture on the ERP implementation, with AI-powered integrated planning system specialist o9 Solutions handling the supply and demand planning component.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the preparation we had been doing for the last 18 months positions us well in terms of successful execution,\u201d Mondelez chief financial officer Luca Zamarella said about the ERP project in a July 30 analyst call on second-quarter results. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to minimize all potential issues by going broadly in one region or by going broadly in the world on SAP. And we believe, given also the resources we have internally and importantly the ones we have secured through SAP and Accenture, that we will have a good opportunity to execute this well.\u201d\n\nBesides enhancing internal platform engineering abilities, the AWS partnership provides a cloud services suite that Mondelez said \u201caligns seamlessly\u201d with its focus on automation, security, resiliency and agility, which the company described as \u201ckey pillars\u201d of its strategic growth plan. AWS\u2019 focus on renewable energy and energy-efficient data centers also is expected to advance sustainability, Mondelez added.\n\n\u201cMondelez has a clear vision of how the cloud, AI and systems like SAP RISE can fuel its growth, and it is truly impressive to see the company execute on that vision,\u201d said Rich Geraffo, vice president of AWS North America. \u201cOur team is proud to have worked closely with their organization to implement the architecture, applications and services that will serve as a foundation for continued innovation across their company.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with AWS comes nearly five months after Mondelez announced the hiring of Filippo Catalano as chief information and digital officer, charged with accelerating the company\u2019s global technology and digital transformation. Catalano previously held the same role at health care brands company Reckitt. Mondelez noted that, while at Reckitt, Catalano led initiatives to \u201cre-platform\u201d the company\u2019s technology stack to boost omnichannel operations and implement AI, machine learning and advanced analytics platforms and solutions.",

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the United States government is making its way into Australian politics and business. While global companies such as mining giant Rio Tinto say they are adhering to their inclusion practices, many others with significant Australian arms, such as global services company Accenture, are scaling back politically charged DEI initiatives to stay in the lucrative US market. There are signs, too, of softening commitments to such programs in Australian boardrooms.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is the social licence is moving backwards,\u201d one director in the financial services industry tells The Saturday Paper. On a range of progressive issues, including climate change commitments, they observed, \u201cpeople say it\u2019s time to cut back\u201d.\n\nThis past week, after years of troubled negotiation, the independent body that sets governance standards for companies listed on the Australian stock exchange quietly shelved a plan to require more detailed diversity reporting.\n\nThe ASX Corporate Governance Council was preparing a fifth set of recommendations that would update the prior 2019 edition to require reporting not only on gender \u2013 data that has helped increase the numbers of women on boards \u2013 but aspects such as sexuality, age, indigeneity and disability. Compliance with these benchmarks is not mandatory, but non-compliant companies are required to explain omissions.\n\nAccording to The Australian Financial Review, five key members voted not to proceed, including the ASX itself and lobby group the Business Council of Australia. The latter complained in its submission that Australian companies were already facing an \u201conslaught of regulatory change, including the introduction of mandatory climate-related financial disclosures\u201d.\n\nThe recommendations would have included a benchmark for 40 per cent female representation on boards and governing bodies, up from the current 30 per cent requirement. Last year, the annual report from industry research group ACSI said female representation on ASX200 boards had risen above 37 per cent \u2013 that compares with only about 21 per cent a decade ago.\n\nResponding to a related question from Greens Senator Barbara Pocock in Senate estimates on Thursday, Joe Longo, the chair of corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting incident and a disappointing one because I think there were high hopes right up until recently that there would be a fifth edition. It just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the members on their board, the financial services director says discussions have already shifted from raising quotas to \u201cmerit-based\u201d appointments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting if there\u2019s a change of government,\u201d they said, noting that the corporate watchdog tends to take its cues from the leadership of the day.\n\nFor a Liberal leader, Peter Dutton has been unusually outspoken in criticising corporations over progressive stances on issues such as support for the Indigenous Voice to Parliament \u2013 in the case of Wesfarmers, Rio Tinto and others \u2013 or the stocking of Australia Day merchandise, which Woolworths boycotted last year.\n\nAs part of its election pitch, the Coalition has focused heavily on proposed cuts to the public service, and the opposition leader has made very clear his disdain of advisers in the space of culture, diversity and inclusion.\n\n\u201cSuch positions, as I say, do nothing to improve the lives of everyday Australians,\u201d Dutton said in a speech to the Menzies Research Centre in late January. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not frontline service delivery roles that can make a difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThese are programs in business and public institutions that are cited in Trump\u2019s executive orders as \u201cdangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences\u201d. The US president claims they have diminished \u201cindividual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination\u201d. To secure US government contracts, employers now must certify that they do not operate DEI programs. They have already been scaled back at companies with significant Australian presences such as Amazon, PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s and tech giants Meta and Google.\n\nWhile consulting firms active in Australia \u2013 PwC, EY and KPMG \u2013 have reaffirmed commitments to diversity targets, major government technology contractor Accenture has ripped up its global diversity and inclusion goals after what US-based chief executive Julie Sweet describes as an \u201cevaluation of the changing US political landscape\u201d.\n\nAn internal Accenture memo, seen by The Saturday Paper, states that the move is \u201cnot just in the US\u201d and is \u201csubject, as always, to local laws and tailored to the needs of our local markets\u201d.\n\nAccenture, which has about 6500 staff in Australia, will start \u201csunsetting\u201d the diversity goals it set in 2017, along with career development programs for \u201cpeople of specific demographic groups\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are and always have been a meritocracy,\u201d Sweet wrote to staff, before stressing that \u201cdifferent backgrounds, different perspectives and different experiences are essential to driving innovation and serving global companies across multiple industries\u201d.\n\nThe Department of Finance says Accenture and other companies giving up equity and inclusion targets or practices will have to maintain compliance with Australian law.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a particular requirement around specific DEI things that someone has to sign up to, but that\u2019s what we would have to look at in its totality,\u201d secretary of the Department of Finance Jenny Wilkinson told the Senate estimates hearing.\n\n\u201cWe would have to look at what the domestic arm of Accenture was doing. We would be very concerned if they were not complying with Australian law.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher added that the Albanese government would not be \u201cseeking to exempt\u201d any entity from Australian requirements.\n\nBarbara Pocock, who worked as an equal opportunity officer in the 1980s in New South Wales, asked the Department of Finance if it was actively monitoring Accenture as a major contractor.\n\nThe answer from the deputy secretary, Richard Windeyer, was: \u201cNo, we are not. We are not monitoring the practices.\u201d\n\nThe South Australian senator was unimpressed. \u201cWhat is the meaning of a code of conduct, if you have a major contractor who clearly stated they are giving it up, DEI, in the shadow of Trump? Does that mean nothing?\u201d Pocock asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not saying it means nothing, senator,\u201d Windeyer replied. \u201cIt will continue to be important that they are able to demonstrate that they are able to support diversity.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to hypothetically know, frankly, what we will see, what might look different to us when we\u2019re looking to work with or consider working with Accenture versus any other supplier.\u201d\n\nAn Accenture spokesperson tells The Saturday Paper that the company will not be backtracking on hard-fought workplace achievements and will comply with Australian law.\n\nOne avenue for some companies trying to breach the divide in their US and Australian operations may be to soften their external communications on matters of diversity and inclusion, while holding firm internally.\n\nSex Discrimination Commissioner Anna Cody says global companies must abide by the laws of the countries they operate in, and Australia\u2019s position is strong. Employers\u2019 obligations are laid out clearly in Respect @ Work legislation, and gender balance is guided by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency requirements.\n\n\u201cLack of gender diversity and inclusion is a financial risk, which is why we must stay the course on these critical issues. We\u2019re encouraged that in the Australian context we haven\u2019t seen material evidence of companies stepping away from gender diversity commitments.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner insists she is not seeing strident changes in Australia.\n\n\u201cWhen I speak to corporates there\u2019s a very clear commitment, particularly with the Respect @ Work program of work, to continue to abide by their legal obligations, which are to eliminate those forms of inequality, and particularly gender inequality, throughout the workplace.\u201d\n\nThis is a sentiment echoed by Debby Blakey, chief executive of HESTA. The superannuation giant is among several in the industry that have pushed for higher quotas of women on boards and supported the new reporting recommendations for ASX companies. HESTA has a policy of exerting pressure on recalcitrant companies where it is a major shareholder, and Blakey says it will \u201ccontinue to engage\u201d. The superannuation industry has considerable heft, with roughly $4 trillion of funds to invest and is keen to meet their clients\u2019 increasing demands to support businesses that uphold environmental and social goals.\n\n\u201cLack of gender diversity and inclusion is a financial risk, which is why we must stay the course on these critical issues,\u201d Blakey says. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that in the Australian context we haven\u2019t seen material evidence of companies stepping away from gender diversity commitments.\u201d\n\nResource giants Woodside Energy and Rio Tinto have recommitted to their diversity and inclusion goals. Woodside doubled its full-year profit and amid the reporting to the ASX stated it is \u201ccommitted to improving the diversity mix of our workforce to reflect the communities in which we operate\u201d.\n\nRio Tinto\u2019s persistence follows reports of an internal \u201cbacklash\u201d against diversity efforts, according to comments from the chief executive of its Australian operations, Kellie Parker, last year. The programs were implemented to address a damning report from 2021, including a survey pointing to widespread bullying, sexual harassment and racism. Chief executive of the iron ore division Simon Trott told an audience this month that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to do a better job explaining how diversity benefits us all\u201d.\n\nIn November, the AFR reported that Rio would \u201csoon\u201d release new workplace diversity targets for 2030, but that the company\u2019s chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, \u201cwanted to talk more with colleagues before deciding whether it was appropriate to aim for gender balance\u201d. There\u2019s been no announcement of a new target since.\n\nSusan Lloyd-Hurwitz, who is a non-executive director of Macquarie Group and joined Rio Tinto\u2019s board of directors in 2023, says \u201cboth companies firmly understand that harnessing the best talent to create diverse and inclusive teams is about driving business performance \u2013 nothing more, nothing less\u201d.\n\nAsked by Senator Pocock in Senate estimates about a \u201cshadow of Trump\u201d in Australia, ASIC\u2019s Joe Longo focused on what he sees as a strong corporate culture.\n\n\u201cThis unfolding situation is a concern to anyone who is worried about the higher standards of corporate governance,\u201d the ASIC chair replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our views about the US, but\u2026 our values, our principles, are well embedded in our institutions and in our law.\n\n\u201cNow, some of that are actually values and principles. They\u2019re not to be found in the Corporations Act. We have a particular culture, a way of doing things in Australia and we should be, I think, proud of that.\u201d\n\nAs the private sector considers how to align in the DEI debate, the opposition continues to campaign heavily on an efficiency drive. Without providing detail on where jobs would be cut, Dutton has claimed savings from the public service of as much as $6 billion a year.\n\nAcross this week\u2019s sessions of Senate estimates, opposition members have been actively grilling agencies and departments over factors such as staffing levels and flexible working arrangements. A particular target was the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which is preparing for its signature data release on the gender pay gap for employees, including chief executives, at 7800 individual private sector employers.\n\nGreens Senator Larissa Waters noted the interest as she questioned the head of WGEA.\n\n\u201cAfter this morning\u2019s line of questioning from the Coalition \u2013 which covered things like the cost of your lease, how many people sit in their chairs at work and usage of stock photos \u2013 are you concerned about the longevity of your agency, should the Coalition form government?\u201d\n\nWGEA chief executive Mary Wooldridge responded that the agency had existed and worked constructively with the government of the day for 40 years, and \u201cwill continue to do so\u201d.\n\nMore explicit commitment is needed to ensure a level playing field, says Barbara Pocock.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to pale, male and stale public sector or consulting firms,\u201d she tells The Saturday Paper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of it. It doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not effective, it\u2019s not efficient and we need to stick with the good, inclusive diversity programs that we are world leaders on.\u201d",

            "content": "Accenture (ACN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this consulting company have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which Accenture falls in, has lost 5.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAccenture is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.73 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.73 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Accenture is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Accenture is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "One of government\u2019s biggest technology service sellers has ditched diversity policies in the shadow of the Trump administration, raising questions about how it can remain a responsible supplier.\n\nAccenture, which has inked nearly 1,000 federal contracts in Australia worth more than $7 billion, this month announced it is ditching gender quotas and other diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nThe move was reportedly made to appease the Trump administration and ensure it did not lose out on work from the president\u2019s order preventing US agencies from engaging suppliers with active DEI policies.\n\nAustralia is heading in the other direction, with parliament currently weighing new laws that would require large companies to set and meet gender equality targets to remain eligible for federal contracts.\n\nAccenture\u2019s memo to Australian staff said the changes apply globally \u201csubject, as always, to local laws and tailored to the needs of our local markets\u201d.\n\nWhen quizzed about Accenture\u2019s moves, ASIC chair Joe Longo said the corporate regulator is concerned about the governance impact of a wider corporate retreat on diversity. But scrapping DEI isn\u2019t necessarily breaking corporate law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you could say \u2018the Corporations Act requires diversity in the boardroom\u2019. I don\u2019t think you could put it as bluntly as that. I think it\u2019s more likely to be more subtle,\u201d Mr Longo said at Senate Estimates on Thursday.\n\nConsequences will arise elsewhere, according to Mr Longo, who foresees the entities running up against policies like government procurement.\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth \u2014 I\u2019m speaking hypothetically \u2014 won\u2019t want to do business with an entity that doesn\u2019t subscribe to these [DEI] values and principles. I can see that way of enforcing, if I can use that word, this approach,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Accenture\u2019s case, it could be especially effective. The Irish domiciled multinational has signed almost $28 million in federal contracts already in 2025 and last year secured its biggest ever, a $289 million contract to uplift aged care technology.\n\nGreens Senator Barbara Pocock says Accenture\u2019s move to stay \u201csweet\u201d with President Trump could distort a market of government suppliers.\n\n\u201cIf a bunch of contractors and consultants are attending carefully to their DEI obligations, which they consider an ethical baseline for themselves as enterprises, and Accenture walks away, it creates a really significant difference in that playing field? Does it not?\u201d she asked Department of Finance officials this week.\n\nOfficials said the tech services giant will continue to be bound by Australian law and expected to demonstrate it is supporting diversity, but its actions are not being actively monitored.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing we will certainly look at closely in the context of procurement decisions,\u201d Department of Finance deputy secretary Richard Windeyer said.\n\nA new federal supplier code of conduct means Accenture and others are \u201cencouraged to look for opportunities to improve gender equality in the workplace and support a diverse and inclusive workforce\u201d among several other ethical considerations.\n\nLongstanding Commonwealth Procurement Rules also oblige government buyers to consider suppliers\u2019 ethical behaviour and integrity, as well as broader benefits to the Australian economy of the work.\n\nBut it is a bill currently before the Senate that could set much clearer and more enforceable DEI requirements on suppliers.\n\nIf passed, it will require to employers with 500 or more employees to select and meet gender equality targets and report on their progress to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.\n\nFailure to comply could see the company named and shamed and made ineligible for federal government work.\n\nThe bill has passed the House of Representatives and was read a second time in the Senate this month.\n\nMr Longo said Australia\u2019s progress on inclusion does not hinge on any one policy and is embedded in national institutions and law.\n\n\u201cWe have a particular culture, a way of doing things in Australia, and I think we should all be proud of that\u2026 Entities will have to take responsibility for what they say about their practices and approach to this topic. We\u2019re all going to be interested to see what happens in the next six to 12 months to see what walking back there is from this topic.\u201d\n\nDo you know more? Contact James Riley via Email.",

            "content": "In recognition of his accomplishments in wealth management, Morgan Stanley announced in 2022 that Zaro, then serving as a First Vice President and Financial Advisor at the firm\u2019s Wealth Management office, was named to Forbes Magazine\u2019s prestigious list of Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors. This ranking evaluates candidates based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including industry experience, leadership experience, assets under management, revenue trends, and compliance records. The selection process also incorporates insights gained from extensive interviews.\n\nWith over two decades of experience, Zaro founded Bourgeon Capital with the vision of offering a more client-centric approach to wealth management. His goal has always been to foster strong, long-term relationships with clients through honest and strategic financial guidance. Bourgeon Capital continues to uphold this commitment, ensuring that each client\u2019s investment strategy is tailored to their unique financial needs and aspirations.\n\nJohn Zaro\u2019s career in finance has been marked by influential roles at major financial institutions; it began at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC where he held the role of vice president from 1984 to 1991. Later, he served as a portfolio manager and vice president at J.P. Morgan Investment Management from 1991 to 1997 during which he managed substantial assets for clients. Just before establishing Bourgeon Capital, Zaro held the positions of Chief Investment Officer and Managing Director at Warburg Pincus Asset Management from 1997 to 1999. During his time there, he played a key role in shaping investment strategies for high-net-worth clients. With expertise in portfolio and alpha target management, Zaro was instrumental in refining investment processes for private clients and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nJohn Zaro, the firm\u2019s founder and managing partner, has an extensive background in investment management spanning several decades. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Economics from Stanford University, he is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and an active member of the New York Society of Security Analysts.\n\nBourgeon Capital Management LLC is an investment advisory firm headquartered in Darien, Connecticut. Founded in 1999 by seasoned financial professional John Aniblo Zaro, the firm specializes in actively managed, separate accounts with investment portfolios consisting primarily of stocks and bonds. In 2002, Bourgeon Capital expanded its leadership team when Michael Keohane joined SAC Capital to co-manage the firm\u2019s long/short hedge fund. With a portfolio value of nearly $535.55 million by the end of December 2024, Bourgeon Capital is known for providing personalized investment strategies designed to manage risk while achieving long-term growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Top 12 Stocks to Buy According to Bourgeon Capital . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other stocks to buy according to Bourgeon Capital.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBourgeon Capital\u2019s investment philosophy is centered on achieving consistent, long-term returns while minimizing volatility. The firm prioritizes risk management by employing strategies that aim to reduce extreme market fluctuations. A key approach under Zaro\u2019s leadership has been investing excess cash in the bond market to capitalize on higher interest rates. This strategy reflects the firm's commitment to balancing risk and reward while ensuring that clients\u2019 investments align with their financial goals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Bourgeon Capital\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of Bourgeon Capital\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024. In order to assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from over 1000 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Originally founded in 1989, the company has grown into a Fortune Global 500 leader, offering expertise in areas such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, finance, supply chain management, and sustainability. Serving industries ranging from aerospace and banking to healthcare and energy, Accenture leverages AI-driven solutions to enhance customer and employee experiences, drive brand loyalty, and optimize business operations.\n\nThe company traces its roots back to the early 1950s as the business and technology consulting arm of Arthur Andersen. One of its early milestones was a feasibility study for General Electric, leading to the first commercial installation of a UNIVAC I computer in the U.S. at GE\u2019s Appliance Park in Kentucky. Over the decades, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has continued to evolve, integrating advanced technologies and expanding its industry reach to help businesses navigate digital transformation and remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) announced its collaboration with SAP to provide personalized learning and training services aimed at upskilling and reskilling employees across various organizational levels. As one of the first global partners authorized to deliver SAP Learning programs, Accenture will integrate SAP\u2019s partner-led training initiatives with its own expertise to foster a culture of continuous learning. This partnership offers businesses access to structured, instructor-led training and customized learning journeys, enhancing employees\u2019 technical and industry-specific skills. The initiative is designed to optimize SAP solution adoption, improve decision-making, and increase workforce satisfaction, ultimately strengthening employee retention and organizational growth. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to earn an SAP-focused Nanodegree from Udacity through Accenture LearnVantage. Both companies are also working on leveraging AI-driven learning pathways to further personalize training, ensuring professionals are equipped with the latest SAP knowledge to drive business transformation.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue finding compelling new ideas, even as the bull market proceeds. In Q3, we initiated three new positions in Aon, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and Builders FirstSource. Accenture is a leading global IT services and consultancy business. We think the services it provides \u2014 which are differentiated and in specialty areas relative to many of its peers \u2014 are critical and will be in high demand in the technology ecosystem for years to come. This should contribute to stable prices and margins. We believe the market is undervaluing Accenture relative to the opportunity ahead of it and, consequently, were able to initiate a position in the quarter at a discounted share price.\u201d\n\nOverall ACN ranks 9th on our list of the stocks to buy according to Bourgeon Capital. While we acknowledge the potential for ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Consulting.us\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Department of Defense (DoD), headed by recently-appointed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, announced that it would slash consulting services that do not align with the president\u2019s priorities. Though details on the cuts are scant, here is a look at the top players when it comes to DoD consulting contracts.\n\nAn oft-repeated criticism of the US government charges it with being too dependent on consulting firms, essentially outsourcing critical governmental functions to the private sector \u2013 at huge cost to tax payers, no less. The DoD is no exception to this, billing private firms billions every year for a wide range of consulting services.\n\nNow, with US President Donald Trump and his closest aid Elon Musk cutting enormous amounts of expenditures across the government, the DoD is next in line. Hegseth, a noted Trump loyalist, is likely to do the bidding of his bosses with little push-back, considering he already publicly defended Trump\u2019s shocking move to fire Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr., one of the Pentagon\u2019s top officials.\n\nHegseth\u2019s DoD said in a memo that it will \u201cconduct a comprehensive review and validation of existing contracts for consulting services.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the review is to carry out an assessment of contracts, \u201cfor the purpose of terminating or descoping contracts for activities that are not essential for the Department to fulfill its statutory purposes.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that the memo does not define \u201cconsulting services,\u201d nor much less provide any details on which services they are referring to.\n\nDetermining which consultancies are the top players when it comes to DoD contracts is quite tricky because exact, up-to-date figures are not always publicly available. That being said, some of the most significant players are Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, Accenture, and McKinsey & Company, all of which are known to have high-value contracts with the DoD.\n\nSo, though we do not know exactly what actions will be taken after Hegseth\u2019s review of contracts, we can assume all DoD contracts might potentially end up on the chopping block. While major, mission-critical contracts are unlikely to be scrapped, it is impossible to know what cuts will be made.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton is a heavyweight in DoD contracts. This tech and defense consultancy is known for raking in billions annually from federal contracts, with a huge chunk coming from the DoD. In 2022, for example, Booz Allen Hamilton reported defense-related revenue of around $6.8 billion, according to industry analysis from USGI.\n\nIts work spans areas like cybersecurity, AI, and mission support, all of which the DoD spends heavily on. Booz does not just offer the typical strategy consulting, but is embedded in operational and tech support, which inflates their contract values.\n\nDeloitte\n\nBig 4 consultancy Deloitte is another major player. While the firm does not always disclose DoD-specific numbers, their federal practice is known to be massive, and they have long been a go-to for business transformation, IT modernization, and audit-related services.\n\nIn 2023, the DoD reported that Deloitte was awarded a $450,000,000 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for rapid research, development, testing, and evaluation \u2013 and that is just one disclosure. Last year, Deloitte was awarded a potential five-year contract worth $2.4 billion to work with the Navy and DoD on efforts to modernize and expand infrastructure for submarines.\n\nAccenture\n\nAccenture Federal Services, a subsidiary of Accenture focused exclusively on US federal government contracts, was awarded nearly $1.6 billion for just a single contract last year to scale and enhance Cloud One, a cloud computing platform available to the DoD. That is just one among many other such Accenture contracts over many years.\n\nJust the fact alone that Accenture has an entire subsidiary focused on these types of US government contracts indicates just how much revenue it scores from these kind of contracts. In fact, the firm was quick to ditch DEI in line with Trump directives, in large part out of fear of losing those contracts.\n\nMcKinsey & Company\n\nDespite a lack of transparency when it comes to DoD contracts, some of the mystery was unveiled last year in a probe by US lawmakers demanding information on contracts signed by the DoD and the Department of Justice. The impetus for the probe was outrage over McKinsey\u2019s failure to properly disclose its work with the government of China.\n\nThe probe revealed that McKinsey has earned around $470 million from various DoD contracts since 2008, including work on the F-35 fighter jet program and projects related with microchips. That includes revenues from over 90 prime contracts with the DOD and over 15 subcontracts, according to probe.\n\nA long list of other contracts\n\nThe very top of the list of contractors to the DoD that bill for the most amount of money are not typical consultancies, but rather defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n\nWhile they may offer the DoD what can be considered traditional consultancy services, the vast majority of the value of their contracts will undoubtedly be from tangible goods like missiles, drones, ships, and aircraft, but also things like training aids and other defense technologies.\n\nRAND Corp and IDA (the Institute for Defense Analyses) also have large contracts with the DoD, but both are non-profits and thus are not in the same league revenue-wise as the big consultancies. RAND Corp does research and analysis, with contracts worth hundreds of millions, while IDA supports technical assessments. The DoD has many other contracts with these type of think-tank organizations.\n\nThe memo on the DoD cuts come as Hegseth ordered the Pentagon to reallocate around $50 billion in the 2026 budget towards initiatives that align with the goals of Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team.",

Organisations are going to rewire themselves and reinvent themselves. It is a huge opportunity to do that now. Globally, over 50,000 people were trained on the Agentic AI platform , and many of them are based in India,\" said Senthil Ramani, lead \u2013 data & AI for Accenture. He spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum 2025 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Recently, Accenture designed a platform\u2014AI Refinery\u2014to onboard agents to work alongside software professionals. The platform caters to 12 industry sectors to help firms rapidly build and deploy a network of AI agents.Ramani emphasised that it is crucial for companies to structure and arrange their data layer effectively. \"Firms need to engage in dialogue with data. By dialogue with data, I mean that when you are in an enterprise and you really want a business to use many of the AI models you create, it is essential to facilitate effective communication with data. If businesses can effectively dialogue with data, then you have already achieved your purpose because you have diffused AI, and they are already using your models,\" Ramani said.He highlighted roles with additional responsibilities that would be reshaping skills in an AI-first world. He said the role of a data engineer is evolving from primarily building data pipelines for data extraction and cleansing to using Gen AI for data engineering. This includes automating and building data products, using GenAI agents for data quality engineering, and employing AI for data governance.The responsibilities of an AI/ML computational scientist are transforming significantly. Rather than relying solely on traditional AI/ML methodologies for model development and training, the focus has shifted towards utilising GenAI with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This advancement enables professionals to create and deploy Gen AI agents, leading to comprehensive process innovations.The role of an LLM (large language model) architect will now evolve from designing an architecture for LLM model usage to designing an architecture for agents where the parameters of multi-LLM environments and autonomous action will need to be addressed.Full stack developers specialising in LLLMs will broaden their scope beyond creating language models. Their expertise will encompass the development of self-governing systems, where smart agents possess the capability to execute real-time decision-making, demonstrate adaptability and perform independent actions.In response to the rapid strides in AI, the interconnection among different teams has become increasingly vital. AI specialists, data analysts, business professionals, and governance experts function cohesively, moving away from siloed operational approaches.",

His new position in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) suggests that consulting firms, long reliant on lucrative government contracts, might face an uncertain future. But how deep will this impact go?AI has already disrupted sectors like customer service, retail, and data entry. However, recent reports indicate that high-paying consulting jobs could also be at risk. Major firms like McKinsey, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) have long benefited from government contracts, but Musk\u2019s cost-cutting approach could significantly reduce their role.Since taking over DOGE, Musk has prioritized eliminating inefficiencies in government spending. His team is actively working to reduce the reliance on external consultants, which means less funding for firms traditionally hired to solve government issues. This could lead to a significant shift in how federal agencies operate.According to data from The Economist, consulting firms like BAH and Accenture (ACN) have secured billions in federal contracts. If Musk decides to drastically cut this spending, these firms could lose a major revenue stream, forcing them to either adapt or downsize.AI\u2019s rapid advancement means that many traditional consulting functions could soon be automated. While human expertise remains valuable, Musk\u2019s vision involves implementing AI-driven strategies in government operations. If this happens, it could lead to significant job losses in the consulting sector.Musk\u2019s connection with Palantir Technologies (PLTR), a defense and data analytics firm, has raised speculation about a shift in consulting partnerships. Palantir\u2019s former Head of Intelligence & Investigations was recently appointed to a key position in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), signaling a possible preference for AI-driven solutions over traditional consulting services.Industry expert Yersultan Sapar, a former Apple engineer and AI entrepreneur, believes that while consulting giants will continue to exist, they must evolve. He predicts a future where firms become more specialized and integrate AI to stay competitive.Musk\u2019s ultimate goal remains unclear. However, with his history of aggressive cost-cutting and automation-focused strategies, it\u2019s possible that government consulting budgets could be drastically reduced or even eliminated in certain sectors.The future of consulting is uncertain, but firms that successfully integrate AI will have a better chance of surviving. As The Economist noted, \u201cUnlike most other software providers, Palantir embeds teams of engineers with its clients to help them make use of its technology.\u201d This suggests that AI-driven consulting could be the new norm.Elon Musk\u2019s cost-cutting approach at DOGE may reduce government spending on traditional consulting firms, shifting towards AI-driven solutions like Palantir.AI is changing consulting, but firms integrating AI alongside human expertise will likely survive and thrive.",

            "content": "As enterprises face an explosion of data-driven decision-making, many struggle with processing petabyte-scale datasets efficiently. Traditional CPU-based systems create bottlenecks, limiting the ability to extract real-time insights and power AI-driven innovations. Addressing this challenge, Accenture has announced an investment in Voltron Data, a company specializing in GPU-powered data processing solutions that accelerate large-scale analytics and enable AI/ML capabilities.\n\nThe investment, made through Accenture Ventures, will help businesses harness high-performance computing (HPC) to eliminate data silos, reduce processing times, and enhance AI adoption\u2014all while optimizing costs and energy consumption.\n\nSolving the data bottleneck problem\n\nEnterprises across industries\u2014from banking to telecommunications and healthcare\u2014generate massive amounts of structured and unstructured data daily. Traditional data processing methods can take hours or even days to analyze key insights, delaying critical business decisions.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nVoltron Data\u2019s flagship product, Theseus, provides a breakthrough approach by leveraging GPUs and other hardware accelerators to process log, machine, and tabular data at lightning speed. Rather than waiting for extended data ingestion times, companies can process complex queries in minutes, unlocking immediate value.\n\n\u201cCompanies across all industries are increasingly using massive datasets to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of traditional infrastructure. Combining Accenture\u2019s expertise in accelerated and high-performance computing with Voltron Data\u2019s large-scale data processing platform, companies can better realize the full potential of their data assets and unlock new kinds of business value,\u201d said David Wood, Accenture\u2019s Technology Consulting lead, in a statement.\n\nAccelerating AI and machine learning adoption\n\nFor organizations investing in AI and machine learning, Theseus provides a unified data analytics and AI pipeline, allowing companies to preprocess data directly on GPUs\u2014whether on-premises or in the cloud. This reduces infrastructure costs, minimizes energy consumption, and accelerates AI model training by removing data bottlenecks.\n\nMichael Abbott, Accenture\u2019s Banking & Capital Markets industry group lead, emphasized the critical role of fast, scalable data analytics. \u201cBanks are sitting on an enormous amount of trapped data with the potential to fuel the next generation of AI-powered products and services. Through its Theseus software, Voltron Data can enable banks and others to unlock their data and then quickly move, scale and analyze it in a way that is both cost-effective and sustainable. It\u2019s like transforming a one-lane road into a multi-lane highway,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat this means for the future of data processing\n\nVoltron Data\u2019s participation in Accenture Ventures\u2019 Project Spotlight expands its reach to global enterprises seeking faster, smarter, and more scalable data solutions. As businesses increasingly rely on generative AI, predictive analytics, and real-time decision-making, GPU-accelerated computing is set to become a core pillar of modern data infrastructure.\n\nWith AI and big data shaping the future of digital transformation, organizations must rethink their data strategies\u2014and Accenture\u2019s latest investment signals a major shift toward high-performance, AI-ready data ecosystems.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nAI is driving innovation. For ERP end users, Accenture\u2019s investment in Voltron Data marks a significant shift toward faster, AI-ready data processing. Traditional ERP systems often struggle with slow query execution and data bottlenecks, limiting real-time insights. With Theseus, ERP users can leverage GPU acceleration to process vast datasets in minutes instead of hours, enabling faster reporting, predictive analytics, and AI-driven automation. This technology also helps businesses reduce cloud costs and improve scalability, making AI-powered ERP more accessible. As companies increasingly rely on real-time data for decision-making, this partnership sets the stage for a new era of high-performance, AI-driven ERP solutions.\n\nBusinesses are investing in AI. Companies are rapidly increasing investments in AI and machine learning, recognizing their potential to drive efficiency and innovation. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017, with 63% of businesses reporting AI usage in at least one function, and research finds that global AI software spending will reach $297.9 billion by 2025, with machine learning and data analytics being top investment areas. Additionally, 90% of Fortune 500 companies are now investing in AI-driven automation.\n\nDriving the emerging technology landscape.

            "content": "Accenture (ACN) closed the latest trading day at $363.91, indicating a -0.1% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.5%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.08%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.21%.\n\nThe consulting company's shares have seen an increase of 0.51% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.19% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.47%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Accenture in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on March 20, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.84, reflecting a 2.53% increase from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $16.62 billion, up 5.21% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.73 per share and revenue of $68.72 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.53% and +5.9%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Accenture. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.3% higher within the past month. At present, Accenture boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Accenture currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 28.62. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 26.88.\n\nIt is also worth noting that ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.23. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computers - IT Services industry stood at 2.42 at the close of the market yesterday.",

Unlike traditional central processing unit (CPU)-dependent systems, the structured query language (SQL) query engine leverages GPUs to slash processing times \u2013 transforming hours-long queries into minutes.\n\nFinancial institutions, for example, generate dozens of terabytes of daily cybersecurity logs that Theseus can rapidly analyze without lengthy data ingestion delays.\n\n\u201cCombining Accenture\u2019s expertise in accelerated and high-performance computing with Voltron Data\u2019s large-scale data processing platform, companies can better realize the full potential of their data assets and unlock new kinds of business value,\u201d said David Wood, Accenture\u2019s Technology Consulting lead.\n\nThe partnership enables clients to unify AI/ML pipelines and analytics on shared GPU infrastructure, reducing energy use and data center space while accelerating insights.\n\nTransforming industries through accelerated insights\n\nWith 799,000 employees across 120 countries, Accenture plans to scale Voltron\u2019s reach to its global client base, including major banks and communications firms. Michael Abbott, Accenture\u2019s Banking lead, likened the technology to \u201ctransforming a one-lane road into a multi-lane highway\u201d for data previously too costly or slow to be utilized fully.\n\n\u201cThis investment and collaboration gives Voltron Data greater reach to empower customers looking to capture the massive opportunities of the artificial intelligence boom,\u201d said Craig Dunham, CEO of Voltron Data.\n\nThe company joins Accenture Ventures\u2019 Project Spotlight program, gaining access to enterprise clients and industry-specific guidance to refine its offerings.\n\nWhile financial terms remain undisclosed, the partnership signals an intensified focus on infrastructure capable of supporting next-generation analytics.\n\nFor the second year running, Accenture ranked #1 in OA500 2024, an objective index of the world\u2019s 500 top outsourcing companies.

            "content": "In a series of videos, the man responsible for the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans discussed planning to kill his family and having dreams that helped inspire him to join ISIS, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more, posted five videos on Facebook in the hours and minutes leading up to the attack, Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nJabbar, a Texas-born US citizen and Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, made reference in the videos to his divorce and how he had at first planned to gather his family for a \u201ccelebration\u201d with the intention of killing them, two officials who had been briefed on the recordings said.\n\nBut Jabbar said in the videos he changed his plans because he wanted news headlines to focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said. Jabbar stated he had joined ISIS before this summer, Raia added.\n\nThe videos, which CNN has not reviewed, were posted on Jabbar\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday between 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m., Raia said. Jabbar also planted two improvised explosive devices in the hours before the attack, which took place about 3:15 a.m.\n\nJabbar was killed while exchanging fire with police after ramming the truck through the crowd in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. He had an ISIS flag in the truck he drove, according to local and federal authorities.\n\nFrom military vet to terrorism suspect\n\nNow, law enforcement authorities are reviewing the videos, as well as phones and laptops potentially linked to Jabbar, as they rush to piece in details about how he went from a military veteran to a suspect in a deadly rampage.\n\nHis family is also trying to understand where he went wrong. Jabbar was born and grew up in Beaumont, Texas, and his brother Abdur Jabbar, 24, and his father, Rahim Jabbar, 65, told CNN they couldn\u2019t reconcile the attack with the kind, soft-spoken person they knew.\n\n\u201cHe was very well-tempered, slow to anger,\u201d Abdur said in an interview in their home in Beaumont. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so unbelievable that he would be capable of something like this.\u201d\n\nAbdur, who spoke with his older brother almost daily over the last year and half, said he thought there must have been a mistake when a relative first told him Jabbar had been identified as the suspect. But then he saw his brother\u2019s face plastered on the news.\n\nThe brothers were raised Muslim and regularly attended a mosque on Friday nights while growing up, but Jabbar never spoke about ISIS or showed any signs of radicalization, Abdur said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never shared anything like that or of that nature with me,\u201d Abdur said. \u201cHe understood what it meant to be a Muslim\u2026 It wasn\u2019t this tragedy. It was the complete opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling us,\u201d Rahim added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going through something that we knew of.\u201d\n\nJabbar served in the Army for more than a decade, an Army spokesperson told CNN. He served as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist on active duty between March 2007 and January 2015, and deployed to Afghanistan once from February 2009 to January 2010, the spokesperson said. After leaving active duty in January 2015, Jabbar served in the Army Reserve until July 2020, when he left service as a staff sergeant.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar works in Fort Johnson (formerly Fort Polk), Louisiana, on November 16, 2013. - 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division/Reuters\n\nServing in the military, Jabber said in a 2020 YouTube video pitching himself as a real estate agent, had taught him \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s to make sure that things go off without a hitch.\u201d The video has since been taken offline. In the video, he sat next to a framed poster with the word \u201cDiscipline\u201d in bold, and near a book titled \u201cLeadership.\u201d\n\nJabbar received an associate degree from Central Texas College in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in 2017, according to an online resume. Both degrees were related to computer science and information technology. He later worked in business development and data engineering at the consulting firms Deloitte and Accenture, according to the resume.\n\nGeorgia State University confirmed to CNN Jabbar attended from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems. Central Texas College and Accenture did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Deloitte said Jabbar served in \u201ca staff-level role since being hired in 2021.\u201d The company is assisting in the investigation and \u201cwe are shocked to learn of reports today that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJabbar obtained in 2019 a real estate license that expired in 2023, according to records from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The records show he took a range of real estate classes on topics such as contract law and finance between 2018 and 2021. He is also listed in public records as having previously registered or being associated with several companies in Texas and Georgia.\n\nContentious divorces and run-ins with the law\n\nJabbar had divorced twice, court documents show. His first wife sued him in 2012 over child support soon after he filed for divorce, and the court ordered him to pay amounts that increased over the years as his income grew. The case was dismissed in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, a Texas judge granted Jabbar\u2019s second wife a restraining order against him during their divorce case. The order mandated Jabbar to refrain from threats, physical harm, or other stipulated behavior against his ex-wife and either of their children. It required her to avoid the same behavior. In a court filing, Jabbar\u2019s ex-wife stated the marriage had become \u201cinsupportable because of discord or a conflict of personalities.\u201d\n\nJabbar had previously had several run-ins with the law. Harris County court records also show that he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft of between $50 and $500 in December 2002, and served nine months of \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he pleaded guilty to charges related to driving under the influence while serving at Fort Bragg, a North Carolina military base, now known as Fort Liberty, according to court records. The documents revealed Jabbar was under the influence of an impairing substance in November 2014 and recorded a blood alcohol level over the legal limit. They also showed that he was driving with \u201can open container of alcoholic beverage after he consumed alcohol.\u201d\n\nJabbar was charged with Level 5 DWI \u2013\u2013 the least severe level of the offense in North Carolina. According to the documents, he had his driver\u2019s license suspended, was placed on probation for 12 months, fined $200 and complied with 24 hours of community service.\n\nThe FBI released Shamsud-Din Jabbar's passport photo. - FBI\n\nIn recent years, Jabbar appears to have struggled with his finances. In a January 2022 email filed as part of his divorce case, he wrote that he could not afford a mortgage payment on his house, which he said was more than $27,000 past due and \u201cin danger of foreclosure\u201d if his divorce settlement was further delayed.\n\nJabbar also stated in the email that a business he had formed, Blue Meadow Properties, had lost about $28,000 the prior year, and that other businesses he formed weren\u2019t worth any money. He added that he had incurred about $16,000 in credit card debt.\n\nA rented truck\n\nJabbar rented the truck he used in the New Year\u2019s attack, a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, on the car rental website Turo, which lets owners rent their vehicles to other people. The truck\u2019s owner confirmed to CNN in a text message that it was rented on Turo.\n\nJabbar picked up the truck on December 30 before driving from Houston to New Orleans the following day, Raia said. Mumtaz Bashir, a neighbor of Jabbar\u2019s in Houston, told CNN he saw Jabbar load up the truck on the morning of December 31, and that Jabbar told him he was moving to New Orleans for a new job.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he needs hands for moving, help him out, as a neighbor, do you need any help moving things around? He said, \u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019\u201d Bashir said. Jabbar appeared to be loading light, handheld items into the truck, he said.\n\nBashir, who said he was shocked and \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the attack, described Jabbar as a nice but quiet person who minded his own business. Bashir said he never saw any kind of \u201cred flag\u201d that Jabbar had been radicalized.\n\nThe rental site was also linked to an incident in Las Vegas involving a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside a Trump Hotel Wednesday. The driver of the Cybertruck died in the explosion, police said. Authorities have not confirmed the name of the dead driver and are investigating whether the incident was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d a Turo spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTuro disabled the truck linked to the New Orleans attack for renting on Wednesday morning. Before it was disabled, the vehicle was listed as costing $105 a day, excluding taxes and fees, and it was unavailable to rent until 12:30 p.m. central time on Wednesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera, Ashley Killough, Evan Perez and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story was updated to include new information on the suspect.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

            "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Accenture plc's ( ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nAccenture Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe insider, Gilles Christian Pelisson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.2m worth of shares at a price of US$308 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$364, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 39% of Gilles Christian Pelisson's holding. Gilles Christian Pelisson was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.\n\nThe chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Accenture insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$158m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Accenture Insiders?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Accenture insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Accenture insiders selling. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE .\n\nBut note: Accenture may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Its stock has skyrocketed, demonstrating the fervor driving the AI market. Yet, as the tech world rallies around Palantir\u2019s allure, two other contenders quietly carve their own paths to success: Accenture and AppLovin.\n\nAccenture, a global titan in IT services, stretches its influence across multiple industries, fostering digital transformation worldwide. Although its historical revenue growth has slowed due to global economic challenges, its investment in generative AI presents a fresh trail of opportunity. From a mere $100 million in 2023, its AI revenue ballooned to $900 million the following year, hinting at a robust pivot toward AI-powered solutions. Despite the headwinds, Accenture forecasts a steady revenue growth of 7% through 2027.\n\nOn the other side, AppLovin draws its strength from a dynamic fusion of mobile app publishing and AI-driven ad monetization. After a rocky 2022, AppLovin resurged, with a remarkable 43% revenue climb in 2024 thanks to its pioneering AI-powered tools. CEO Adam Foroughi paints a future where their AI models, though nascent, herald unprecedented advancements in digital advertising.\n\nThough Palantir\u2019s meteoric rise dazzles, both Accenture and AppLovin offer more anchored yet promising alternatives. With respectable valuations and sustainable growth trajectories, these companies might not boast Palantir\u2019s explosive gains but provide a compelling case for investors seeking balanced exposure to the AI revolution. As AI continues to reshape our world, these understated giants might just be the market\u2019s best-kept secrets.\n\nWhy Accenture and AppLovin Are the Hidden Gems in the AI Revolution\n\nHow Accenture and AppLovin are Revolutionizing AI\n\nPalantir\u2019s soaring stock performance has captured widespread attention as a leader in AI technology, but two under-the-radar contenders are just as worthy of consideration: Accenture and AppLovin. Here, we delve deeper into their strategic pursuits in AI, offering a balanced view of the AI landscape.\n\nHow-To Steps & Life Hacks: Leveraging AI with Accenture\n\n1.

Although it faces strong competition from other consultancy giants like Deloitte and IBM, its commitment to AI sets it apart.\n\n\u2013 AppLovin receives kudos for its innovative AI tools, though it contends with competitors like Unity and IronSource in the mobile advertising sector.\n\nControversies & Limitations\n\nDespite their potential, both companies face challenges:\n\n\u2013 Accenture\u2019s broad market presence means any downturn in its core consulting business could impact its AI initiatives. Its growth may also strain under economic pressures from global markets.\n\n\u2013 AppLovin\u2019s dependence on the volatile mobile ad market can pose risks, as fluctuations in mobile app popularity directly affect its revenue stream.\n\nFeatures, Specs & Pricing\n\n\u2013 Accenture offers scalable consulting and technology services customizable for industries such as finance, healthcare, and consumer goods.\n\n\u2013 AppLovin provides in-depth analytics, seamless integration with popular app stores, and customizable monetization settings for app developers, making it an attractive platform for mobile ad revenue generation.\n\nSecurity & Sustainability\n\nAccenture is committed to sustainable and ethical AI usage, ensuring data privacy and compliance across their services.

Trump\u2019s orders last month dismantling federal DEI policies and programs sparked upheaval and layoffs across the federal workforce while telegraphing similar aims for the private sector. Companies have taken notice: this week, Pepsi, KPMG and Citigroup joined the ranks of firms retiring workforce representation goals. Accenture, Deloitte and Google took similar steps last week, while Goldman Sachs announced it would ditch a requirement for corporate boards of directors to include women and people of color, citing \u201clegal developments.\u201d\n\nSeeds of enforcement are beginning to manifest, with Comcast becoming one of the administration\u2019s first targets. In a Feb. 11 letter, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr notified the media giant that he expects to aid \u201cbroader efforts to root out invidious forms of DEI discrimination across all of the sectors the FCC regulates.\u201d Missouri\u2019s attorney general sued Starbucks in federal court the same day, alleging the coffee chain\u2019s DEI practices discriminated based on race and sex, turning its workforce \u201cmore female and less White.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies are scrambling to strike a balance that keeps them out of the crosshairs of an administration that is openly antagonistic toward DEI, without negating its benefits. But the lack of clarity over what constitutes \u201cillegal DEI\u201d in the eyes of the Trump administration has rattled executives amid growing recognition that methods used for decades to attract and retain diverse talent are no longer viable, according to Tracey Diamond, an employment attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke in Princeton.\n\nAs they reorient, businesses are discarding workforce representation goals and identity-based employee resource groups, rebranding and toning down DEI references in public-facing documents. They\u2019re reframing their policies around \u201cleveling\u201d the playing field for all employees \u2014 \u201cwhether they\u2019re in the majority or minority,\u201d Diamond said \u2014 rather than \u201clifting\u201d people on the basis of race, gender or other considerations.\n\nThe Post reached out to more than 20 companies that have recently signaled commitment to DEI efforts, including those that encouraged shareholders to reject anti-DEI proposals during proxy season, such as Apple, Costco, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. None was willing to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., chief executive of the human resources association SHRM, says he\u2019s been flooded with calls from panicked executives since the Jan. 20 inauguration. Companies were \u201cpreparing\u201d for changes under Trump, he said, \u201cbut not preparing enough.\u201d\n\nThe CEO has been telling executives and SHRM\u2019s roughly 340,000 members that DEI \u201ccannot be a game where you only focus on inclusion for underrepresented groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way to do this legally, but many of you aren\u2019t right now,\u201d Taylor keeps telling them, \u201cand you have to own that.\u201d\n\n\u2018Performing inclusion\u2019\n\nAfter the 2020 murder of George Floyd raised larger conversations about systemic racism, dozens of large companies proclaimed their intent to be part of the solution. They pledged billions and adopted practices meant to create more diverse workforces, including recruiting and mentorship programs for historically marginalized groups, anti-bias training and employee resource groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the pressure to be loud about diversity efforts led to many companies \u201cperforming inclusion without making things more fair,\u201d according to Joelle Emerson, CEO of Paradigm, a culture and inclusion platform. The environment encouraged companies to set up separate DEI operations that could be publicly touted, she said, rather than focus on more sustainable work, such as efforts to make their recruiting and hiring processes more equitable for people of all backgrounds.\n\nNow, as companies adjust under Trump, \u201cI\u2019m seeing companies lean into things that are good for their employees but make clear business sense,\u201d Emerson said. For example, she said, she\u2019s seeing far less demand for \u201cone-time, high visibility training initiatives\u201d such as anti-bias trainings for the whole workforce, and heightened interest in topics like how to minimize bias in recruiting and hiring processes.\n\nStill in this climate, Emerson said, it will be tougher for employers to broadcast their commitment to this work. \u201cCompanies have this selfish motivation to figure out how to achieve those outcomes. They\u2019re going to focus on how to make that happen instead of on \u2018How do we try to prove to people that we\u2019re inclusive?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany companies began reassessing the legality of their of DEI programs after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in university admissions in 2023, which sparked dozens of lawsuits alleging that certain programs violated federal civil rights laws. In the flurry of post-inauguration policy adjustments, many brands focused their messaging on inclusion\u2019s importance to their business operations, even as they retired some programs.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s recruiting restaurant team members directly from the communities in which we operate or creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs and growing a robust and innovative supply chain, our system leverages inclusion to operate successfully and grow our businesses,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a January letter to employees announcing it would end its supplier and leadership diversity goals.\n\nIn an email to The Post, the fast-food chain said it would continue reporting demographic information about its board, employees and suppliers in its annual Purpose & Impact report and that its \u201cleaders will continue to be held accountable for fostering an inclusive environment within their teams.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta\u2019s vice president of people, Janelle Gale, said the social media company remains committed to building \u201cthe best teams with the most talented people\u201d while \u201csourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.)\u201d in a January memo shared with The Washington Post announcing the end some of its DEI policies.\n\nIn place of \u201cequity and inclusion programs\u201d the memo continued, Meta plans to build \u201cprograms that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d\n\nRisk of overcorrection\n\nAs companies adapt, there\u2019s a real risk they\u2019ll go \u201ctoo far in the other direction,\u201d according to Jason Solomon, director of the National Institute of Workers\u2019 Rights. Many DEI policies trace back to compliance with antidiscrimination laws, Solomon noted, and firms that abandon them will be more vulnerable to lawsuits from women and people of color who feel they\u2019re being underpaid or passed over for opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey can challenge the company and say, \u2018You all are giving clear signals all over the place that you don\u2019t really care about being fair to people who traditionally have been discriminated against,\u2019\u201d Solomon said.\n\nLuke Hartig, who counsels Fortune 500 companies and other large employers as president of Gravity Research, said Trump\u2019s DEI actions are already having a chilling effect. He\u2019s been helping companies develop game plans in the event they\u2019re targeted by anti-DEI activists such as Robby Starbuck, or by the Justice Department, which issued a February memo warning that its Civil Rights Division will \u201cinvestigate, eliminate and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of, \u2018Oh gosh, the Trump administration or his allies could target us next and we need to be prepared for that,\u2019\u201d Hartig told The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupplier diversity programs, or policies with \u201cset-asides for diverse applicants\u201d are now magnets for risk, Hartig has told his clients. Anything that could be considered \u201cexclusionary to White men\u201d is also a major liability, he added.\n\nAs companies conduct \u201cself-audits\u201d to vet their policies for legal and reputational risk, they\u2019re struggling to find the right \u201cpublic posture\u201d to take on DEI, Hartig said. Many are hung up on how to communicate to employees that they still prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion at a time when voicing support makes them vulnerable.\n\nFor example, he noted, more firms got perfect scores on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index this year. But unlike in the past, they\u2019re not eager to tout their success amid high-profile withdrawals from the HRC by firms such as Walmart and Pepsi. Reticence is extending beyond DEI, Hartig said, resulting in a \u201cdefault mode of not being inclined to speak,\u201d especially on issues that are unrelated to the company\u2019s core business. Risk is most acute for consumer-facing companies, he said, given the potential costs of boycotts and other consumer actions that have dented brands like Bud Light and Target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf companies are talking about DEI publicly in any way, they\u2019re tying it back to business value,\u201d Hartig said. \u201cOne thing we see very little of compared to five years ago is very little reference to DEI being part of addressing systemic racism and historic inequities.\u201d\n\nThe overhaul of corporate diversity policies is unfolding as more companies face investor challenges to their policies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at shareholder meetings where I was the only one at the meeting,\u201d said Ethan Peck, deputy director of the National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, who has filed scores of shareholder proposals asking companies such as Berkshire Hathaway and Apple to reconsider or eliminate their DEI programs. \u201cNow we\u2019re not alone out there anymore.\u201d\n\nMore than two dozen firms received anti-DEI shareholder proposals this proxy season, including Airbnb, Coca-Cola and General Motors. And earlier this month, Todd Russ, Oklahoma Treasurer, announced that his state would follow suit with shareholder proposals calling for \u201cpolitical neutrality,\u201d targeting Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix, which Oklahoma invests in through its $2 billion Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust.\n\nCorporate America\u2019s waning confidence in DEI is noticeable, Peck said. In 2022, his group\u2019s negotiations with companies felt \u201chostile,\u201d and DEI leaders and executives would accuse him of being racist for questioning their policies. By 2023, the tone was \u201cstill hostile, but not as hostile,\u201d and DEI teams were no longer at the table.\n\nBy 2024, most companies were saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t really have the programs you\u2019re accusing us of having,\u201d Peck told The Post. \u201cThey\u2019re not even really mentioning DEI.\u201d\n\nWhen Vanguard, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, released its 2025 U.S. proxy voting guidelines earlier this month, for example, it excluded guidance from the previous year that had called for boards to \u201crepresent diversity of personal characteristics, inclusive of at least diversity in gender, race and ethnicity.\u201d\n\nPeck\u2019s proposals are still garnering extremely low support despite a climate that has shifted in his favor. In January, for example, 98 percent of Costco shareholders shot down his proposal asking the retailer to evaluate the business risks of its diversity policies. In a detailed letter to shareholders before the company\u2019s annual meeting, Costco\u2019s board said its DEI efforts \u201cenhance our capacity to attract and retain employees\u201d and dismissed NCPPR\u2019s proposal as \u201cpolicy bias.\u201d\n\nNone of this troubles Peck. He pointed to Boeing, whose shareholders roundly rejected one of his proposals last year, only for the company to dismantle its DEI department months later.",

            "content": "PalantirTechnologies' (NASDAQ: PLTR) stock has soared about 360% over the past 12 months. The bulls rushed back to the artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics company as its revenue growth accelerated and its profits surged. Its inclusion in the list of stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes in the fourth quarter, along with hopes for lower interest rates, amplified those gains.\n\nPalantir's revenue rose 17% in 2023 and 29% in 2024, and it expects 31% growth in 2025. It also turned profitable in 2023 and more than doubled its EPS in 2024, and analysts expect 63% growth in 2025.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nThat explosive growth is being driven by the rapid expansion of its U.S. commercial business, a reliable stream of government contracts, and the rising usage of its analytics platform to support new generative AI applications.\n\nThose catalysts turned Palantir into one of the market's hottest AI stocks. But at $120, Palantir trades at a whopping 385 times forward earnings with an enterprise value of $264.7 billion -- which is roughly 70 times its projected sales for 2025.\n\nThose bubbly valuations make Palantir an extremely risky stock to buy, and its price could easily be cut in half and still be expensive relative to its growth potential. So instead of chasing Palantir's recent rally as the market hovers near its all-time highs, it might be smarter to buy these two more balanced AI plays instead: Accenture(NYSE: ACN) and AppLovin(NASDAQ: APP).\n\nThe conservative AI play: Accenture\n\nAccenture is one of the world's largest IT service providers. It serves more than 9,000 clients across a wide range of industries in over 120 countries, and it helps those large companies digitally transform their sprawling businesses.\n\nAccenture's revenue rose 15% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in August 2022), but only grew 4% in fiscal 2023 and 1% in fiscal 2024. That deceleration was caused by rising rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds which drove many companies to rein in their spending. A strong dollar also eroded its overseas earnings.\n\nHowever, the bright spot was its generative AI (GenAI) business, which grew its total revenue ninefold from $100 million in fiscal 2023 to nearly $900 million in fiscal 2024. That only accounted for 1.4% of its fiscal 2024 revenue, but its rapid growth could offset the slower growth of its more macro-sensitive non-AI businesses.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% as the macroeconomic environment stabilizes, more companies enlist its IT professionals to upgrade their cloud infrastructure and AI services, and it acquires more companies. On the bottom line, the analysts expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% as it prunes its workforce, automates more positions, and cuts its other expenses.\n\nAccenture isn't an explosive growth play like Palantir. But its stock is reasonably valued at 28 times next year's projected earnings, and it's a balanced way to profit from the ongoing expansion of the cloud, AI, and digital transformation markets.\n\nThe aggressive AI play: AppLovin\n\nAppLovin publishes mobile apps and develops AI-powered app monetization tools for other companies. It expanded its digital advertising business by acquiring several of its industry peers, including MoPub and Wurl, over the past four years.\n\nIn 2022, AppLovin's revenue growth flatlined and it turned unprofitable. It struggled as its app monetization business cooled off in a tougher macro environment. But in 2023, its revenue grew 17% and it turned profitable again. It recovered as the digital advertising market warmed up again and more companies adopted its AI-powered AXON ad discovery services. In 2024, its revenue surged 43% -- driven by its 73% growth in advertising revenue -- as its net income more than quadrupled.\n\nDuring AppLovin's latest conference call, CEO Adam Foroughi said while the company was \"really, really early\" in its AI development cycle, its AI models could \"get better.\" Specifically, Foroughi expects large language models (LLMs) and generative AI to help its AXON ad discovery tools place ads more effectively than older AI models.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2026, analysts expect AppLovin's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 22% as its net income increases at a CAGR of 42%. Its stock might seem a bit pricey at 80 times forward earnings, but its balanced exposure to the growing mobile app, digital advertising, and AI markets could justify that higher valuation. Its growth trajectory also looks a lot more sustainable than Palantir's meme stock-like gains over the past year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Distributed applications and hybrid operating environments\u2014where workloads and data reside in on-premises, cloud and edge network facilities simultaneously\u2014create additional complexity.\n\n\u201cEnterprises are relying more on multicloud configurations, and migrating owned assets to network-as-a-service, to enable business transformation,\u201d said Jon Harrod, partner, ISG Network Advisory. \u201cOnce they do, they find they can reduce their IT capital expenditures, rationalize staff and training, and mitigate the risks that typically come from continual software updates.\u201d\n\nMNS encompasses a variety of services, such as enterprise planning and advice, provisioning fixed and mobile infrastructures to streamline network operations, managing and monitoring remote installations, fault diagnosis and configuration management, and disaster recovery. Enterprises are adopting a plethora of network technologies provided by MNS, to gain a competitive edge.\n\nFurther advances in network function virtualization are spreading enterprise workloads across mobile, branch and edge devices in the network. This adds complexity and stress to an enterprise\u2019s internal ICT workforce. The need to tackle such complexity is a major contributing factor to the continued growth of MNS, although on-premises and hybrid computing environments continue to be the largest segment of networks managed by MNS providers.\n\nMNS cybersecurity services cover everything from network provisioning, operations and management to network monitoring. They provide robust security through firewalls, audits, data integrity measures and sophisticated intrusion detection and prevention systems, while offering ongoing software update management and specialized support.\n\n\u201cEnterprise networks have to be very advanced and secure,\u201d said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. \u201cThe bigger the enterprise, the more complex and demanding its network becomes. Improper management of these networks is in and of itself a cybersecurity threat. This is what gives managed network service providers the edge.\u201d\n\nThe report also explores other trends, such as the challenges Europe\u2019s CIOs and CISOs are facing in articulating the ROI expectations for their ICT investments. These executives expect managed service providers to offer technical solutions and serve as strategic partners in quantifying the business impacts of their investments, as well as consulting services to align investments with the enterprise\u2019s business objectives.\n\nFor more insights into how MNS providers are meeting the challenges of growing network complexity and more complex enterprise customer demands, see the ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Focal Points briefing here.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Enterprise Managed Network Services report for Europe evaluates the capabilities of 33 providers across three quadrants: Managed Network Services Evolution, Managed Enterprise Connectivity Solutions (DIA, VoIP & VPN) and Network as a Service (NaaS).\n\nThe report names Accenture, Colt, Deutsche Telekom, GTT and Orange Business as Leaders in three quadrants each. Comcast Business, HCLTech, NTT DATA, Verizon Business and Wipro are named Leaders in two quadrants each. Kyndryl and RIEDEL Networks are named Leaders in one quadrant each.\n\nIn addition, Capgemini, Computacenter and DXC Technology are named as Rising Stars \u2014 companies with a \u201cpromising portfolio\u201d and \u201chigh future potential\u201d by ISG\u2019s definition \u2014 in one quadrant each.\n\nIn the area of customer experience, Accenture is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among enterprise managed network service providers. Accenture earned the highest customer satisfaction scores in ISG's Voice of the Customer survey, part of the ISG Star of Excellence\u2122 program, the premier quality recognition for the technology and business services industry.\n\nCustomized versions of the report are available from Deutsche Telekom, GTT and Orange Business.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Enterprise Managed Network Services report for Europe is available to subscribers or for one-time purchase on this webpage.\n\nAbout ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Research\n\nThe ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Quadrant research series is the only service provider evaluation of its kind to combine empirical, data-driven research and market analysis with the real-world experience and observations of ISG's global advisory team. Enterprises will find a wealth of detailed data and market analysis to help guide their selection of appropriate sourcing partners, while ISG advisors use the reports to validate their own market knowledge and make recommendations to ISG's enterprise clients.

The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (NCISM), with the support of the Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, concluded the closing ceremony marking the completion of the first phase of the \u2018desh Ka Prakriti Parikshan Abhiyaan\u2019 on 20th February 2025 at Mumbai.\n\nFive Guinness World Records:\n\n1. The most pledges received for a health campaign in one week: with 6,004,912 pledges, surpassing the minimum requirement of 14,571, setting a new global benchmark as there was no previous record holder.\n\n2.

He presented the certificates to the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Ayush, Shri Prataprao Jadhav.\n\nMaharashtra's Health Minister Shri Prakash Abitkar, Secretary of the Ministry of Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Chairman of the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (NCISM) Vaidya Jayant Devpujar were also present on the occasion.\n\nUnion Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Ministry of Ayush, Shri Prataprao Jadhav highlighted the Ministry\u2019s unwavering commitment to the development of all Ayush healthcare systems.

He expressed confidence that under the Minister's leadership, the Ministry of Ayush will reach new heights of progress.\n\nThe announcement of the launch of this campaign was made by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the occasion of National Ayurveda Day.

The participants represented various age groups, ethnicities, and backgrounds, truly reflecting the unity in diversity of the nation.\n\nThis extensive participation underscores India\u2019s leadership in personalized healthcare, emphasizing Ayurveda's vital role in preventive healthcare and lifestyle management. This data-driven approach is expected to provide critical insights for evidence-based research, bridging Ayurveda with modern medicine and propelling India\u2019s healthcare landscape forward.\n\n****\n\nMV/AKS\n\n(Release ID: 2105326)\n\nVisitor Counter : 1087",

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nNEW YORK & MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN) announced an investment in Voltron Data, a company that is building software to unlock the next generation of accelerated computing that underpins modern AI applications. This investment, made through Accenture Ventures, will support Voltron Data in its efforts to help organizations use advanced computing technology to speed up large-scale analytics, used for generative AI and machine learning applications.\n\nFounded in 2021 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, Voltron Data\u2019s core solution\u2014Theseus \u2014is a SQL query engine that can enable enterprises to process petabyte-scale data faster and at a lower cost than traditional CPU-based systems.\n\nMany enterprises lack effective methods to quickly garner insights from their massive datasets, leading to slower decision-making and missed opportunities. Theseus uses accelerated hardware, including graphics processing units (GPUs), to quickly analyze log, machine and tabular data - handling what used to be hours-long queries in minutes. For example, cybersecurity systems for financial service institutions generate dozens of terabytes of data daily. With Theseus, organizations can cut the total time to insights by skipping long ingest times and using GPUs to power through data.\n\nTheseus is built to help companies take advantage of GPUs and full system hardware accelerators, on-premise or in the cloud, enabling data preprocessing for AI/ML workloads on GPUs which unifies data analytics and AI pipelines on the same infrastructure, while also reducing energy consumption and data center footprint.\n\nDavid Wood, Accenture\u2019s Technology Consulting lead, said, \u201cCompanies across all industries are increasingly using massive datasets to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of traditional infrastructure. Combining Accenture\u2019s expertise in accelerated and high-performance computing with Voltron Data\u2019s large-scale data processing platform, companies can better realize the full potential of their data assets and unlock new kinds of business value.\u201d\n\nLike Accenture, Voltron Data works with some of the largest global banks, communications, media & technology firms and governments.\n\n\u201cBanks are sitting on an enormous amount of trapped data with the potential to fuel the next generation of AI-powered products and services,\u201d said Michael Abbott, Accenture\u2019s Banking & Capital Markets industry group lead. \"Through its Theseus software, Voltron Data can enable banks and others to unlock their data and then quickly move, scale and analyze it in a way that is both cost effective and sustainable. It\u2019s like transforming a one lane road into a multi-lane highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investment and collaboration gives Voltron Data greater reach to empower customers looking to capture the massive opportunities of the artificial intelligence boom,\u201d said Craig Dunham, CEO of Voltron Data. \u201cWorking with Accenture means following their historic record of creating value from innovation, expanding our channel partnerships to increase awareness and helping more customers harness the power of their data.\u201d\n\nVoltron Data is the latest company to join Accenture Ventures\u2019 Project Spotlight, a vertical accelerator for data and AI companies.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other top AI news Wall Street is paying attention to.\n\nHeightened competition in the development of powerful artificial intelligence models is more than welcome. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed by Ark Investment Management chief executive officer Cathie Wood in the aftermath of DeepSeek rattling the markets and tech world with a cost-effective AI model.\n\nWhile there have been concerns that DeepSeek\u2019s new open-source AI model challenges US dominance around the advanced technology, Wood insists it is a positive development. According to Woods, DeepSeek has only fostered the need for tech companies to focus on cutting costs and developing powerful AI models.\n\n\u201cWe looked at DeepSeek\u2019s model and learned that it is moving down the cost curve associated with this new technology at a rapid rate, but not much different from the rate at which OpenAI and Anthropic are riding down the cost curve,\u201d Wood said.\n\nAccording to Wood, the costs of developing AI models have been dropping, even before DeepSeek came calling with a cost effective model. Similarly, she joins a growing list of high-profile individuals who have questioned whether $6 million was the only cost that DeepSeek incurred in developing its models.\n\nWood also insists that now is not the time to regulate artificial intelligence as DeepSeek development has opened the door for competition on AI costs. The remarks come on the heels of the European Union establishing rules that will govern the use of AI, marking the first comprehensive legal framework in the world.\n\nThe EU AI Act prohibits using specific AI systems that pose unacceptable risks to citizens. Companies face fines of up to $35.8 million for any breach. While the AI act could affirm sentiments that Europe regulates the tech industry heavily to the detriment of innovation, Diyan Bogdanov, director of engineering intelligence at Payhawk, shares contrasting views.\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. and China compete to build the biggest AI models, Europe is showing leadership in building the most trustworthy ones. The EU AI Act\u2019s requirements around bias detection, regular risk assessments, and human oversight aren\u2019t limiting innovation they\u2019re defining what good looks like,\u201d said Bogdanov.\n\nEven as the European AI Act seeks to promote ethical standards, accountability, and trust, its extraterritorial implications are creating a stir across the Atlantic. Businesses, legislators, and policymakers in the United States are currently negotiating a rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) regulatory environment.\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz has already called for an investigation into European influence on US AI policymaking, a dramatic move that highlights rising tensions. Senator Cruz\u2019s worries reflect a broader concern that unduly restrictive European standards may jeopardize the United States\u2019 innovation-driven approach to technology.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a technology company that offers strategy and consulting services. It also offers systems integration, application management and security solutions. On Feb. 18, INFRONEER Holdings and Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) announced a joint venture, INFRONEER Strategy & Innovation, to promote innovation in the construction and operation of infrastructure in Japan. The JV, 81% owned by INFRONEER HD and 19% by Accenture, will be established on April 1, 2025, with around 100 employees.\n\nWhile leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, the two companies aim to address critical issues plaguing Japan\u2019s aging infrastructure.

Lemay was tapped to design the new headquarters in Montreal, Canada, which captures the dynamism of the workforce and the urban landscape. Located on the 15th floor of the Place Ville Marie cruciform tower downtown, it balances references to the city with brand standards. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong link to where the office is situated, the employees, and the work that they do,\u201d says Carolyne Thibault, interior design project director for Lemay.\n\nNotable art installations served as inspiration, like Claude Cormier\u2019s \u201cThe Ring,\u201d a massive circular sculpture that can be seen from the office. As soon as visitors enter the 19,000-square-foot workplace, they are greeted by a custom wall composed of 1,200 interactive trigonal prisms in Accenture\u2019s signature colors \u2013 including the purple hue of its logo.\n\nAs natural light cascades in, ever-changing reflections pulse with movement. This element sets the tone, reinforcing the company\u2019s connection to the area, while also echoing the forward-thinking culture. The interiors double as a canvas, with white walls and a bespoke felt ceiling to amplify the vibrant complementary tones of the furniture, from forest green to burnt sienna.\n\nThe design team hosted a series of discovery sessions with staff members and management to ensure that there were a variety of work points. Flexible spaces are ideal for informal meetings and socializing during the day, while focus rooms and booths offer more privacy when needed. One highlight is what Thibault calls the spa room. Decorated with a cloud motif, the meeting room is anything but typical. The interior evokes the sensation of floating in the sky, surrounded by soothing blue tints that create a sense of well-being.\n\nAt the caf\u00e9 and in the other communal hubs, lush hanging gardens bring nature indoors in a more sophisticated way. Users can complete tasks or enjoy meals in these airy settings that call to mind the notable green space in the city, designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, Parc du Mont-Royal.\n\nCurbed corners add softness and connect to each area, whether at the IT solutions bar, in seating lounges, or library shelving. For Hani Diab, concept director at Lemay, the playful moments are built in with an unmistakable energy that aligns with what happens outside. \u201cThe office is whimsical, because we played with elements of surprise to represent Montreal,\u201d he notes.\n\nFor more information on Accenture Montreal or Lemay, visit lemay.com.\n\nPhotography by Claude-Simon Langlois, courtesy of v2com.",

            "content": "Accenture\u2019s acquisition of AOX aims to provide embedded software architecture expertise while also encouraging digital native mindsets. By Stewart Burnett\n\nAutomakers have not experienced equal success in transitioning to software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Legacy automakers have generally faced setbacks that their newer counterparts successfully evaded. This has led to some older brands reaching out to start-ups for collaboration.\n\nHowever, these partnerships will not be a feasible option for all brands. For some time, strategy and consultancy firm Accenture has maintained that a fundamental shift in organisational mindsets will be crucial for everyone to succeed in their SDV ambitions. In March 2024, it launched the LearnVantage Academy, an educational platform intended to instil this message, while also building core competencies and coaching leadership.\n\nThen, in December 2024, Accenture announced it would acquire automotive digital technologies firm AOX. According to Christof Horn, Global Head of SDV at Accenture, this will bolster the consultancy\u2019s ability to help its clients excel across the entire software development process. \u201cSoftware expertise is becoming the dominating factor in the market. The AOX team will become another pillar of the automotive technology powerhouse Accenture has been building over the past few years.\u201d\n\nCapacity for hire\n\nTaking cues from the amenability of major automakers to external partnerships, AOX is intended to act as both a support player and a strategic partner in software development for Accenture. The firm\u2019s expertise spans from ideation and architecture R&D through to maintenance and firmware updates across the entire vehicle lifecycle.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of AOX is another strategic move in further growing our SDV capabilities Juergen Reers, Global Automotive and Mobility Lead at Accenture, tells Automotive World. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that: it\u2019s strongly focussed on in-vehicle software architecture, model-based system engineering, providing consultancy work, and enabling the overall transformation.\u201d By bringing AOX into its wider SDV operation, Accenture hopes to build upon its existing offerings with direct software development capacity.\n\nWhile fostering \u2018digital native\u2019 mindsets and a transformational approach to automotive design\u2014hallmarks of the LearnVantage platform\u2014remain crucial to the wider SDV mission, these may not address the more pressing realities automakers face meeting software development deadlines. \u201cTransitioning to software development isn\u2019t easy. It changes not only the vehicle itself, but also its integration within the wider digital infrastructure,\u201d says Reers.\n\nAOX will provide automakers with software architectures and written lines of code while also bolstering Accenture\u2019s consultancy effort. In doing so, Reers explains, automakers are empowered to continue their transition towards SDVs unabated, while still transitioning away from hardware-oriented legacy mindsets. Accenture can also plug gaps in an automaker\u2019s current software development capacity and help it facilitate the transition. This, in turn, helps prevent increasingly common occurrences such as vehicle launch delays due to software development issues, keeping automakers on track with their product release schedules.\n\nFrameworks for success\n\nWhile AOX can undertake a range of software development and support capacities\u2014from high-performance controllers to specific areas like in-vehicle sound\u2014its primary expertise is in building architectures that serve as a foundation for the entire vehicle design strategy. \u201cIf you want to build a house, you need to get the architecture right at the start,\u201d remarks Horn. In practice, this means \u201csolid\u201d and \u201cseamless\u201d processes and standard operating procedures that can be iterated throughout the vehicle\u2019s design cycle and subsequently in maintenance.\n\nFor automakers still getting to grips with the fundamentals, Accenture can support how to deliver and iterate software. For example, in October 2024, the company released a major update of in-vehicle software\u2014a layer that translates communications between the vehicle\u2019s hardware components and the applications running on top \u2013 as open source, making it available for OEMs, tier ones and silicon vendors. Accenture states that this software is now running in some five to six million vehicles currently on roads. Given the demanding timelines in which automakers aim to realise their software ambitions and the relative lack of industry experience, Reers believes having third parties step in, do the work, and provide guidance on how to achieve similar results could prove highly advantageous.\n\nAccenture and AOX make recommendations based on automakers unique SDV goals, but also offer software components and deep technical expertise. One of AOX\u2019s particular areas of expertise is QNX and other real-time operating systems\u2014 software platforms currently gaining traction in the automotive industry and used in applications where low latency and safety are crucial. Reers notes that demand in such technologies will likely increase as automated driving continues to gain traction.\n\nLifecycle awareness\n\nAnother area in which AOX can assist automakers is code optimisation. This is a universal theme across all software development: the leaner the code and the better it suits the unique capabilities of the hardware on which it is running, the faster and more efficiently the resulting software will perform. \u201cYou need to understand that this is a very restricted environment in terms of memory and compute power,\u201d Horn emphasises. Using the bulk of available processing power and memory at the outset with little consideration for optimisation will inevitably make the addition of new features and updates later in the vehicle\u2019s lifecycle more difficult.\n\nIf you want to build a house, you need to get the architecture right at the start\n\nHe adds that the \u201cmanaging\u201d process of maintaining and iterating vehicle software and its interfaces (APIs) is currently \u201cheavily underestimated\u201d. If a third-party provider updates its software, this may require small tweaks to the vehicle\u2019s operating system or other embedded software to prevent unexpected glitches. \u201cIt used to be that a car was built and then more or less left as it was, but now someone needs to take care of these interfaces for a decade.\u201d AOX can provide guidance on how to manage these lifetime processes or take a more hands-on approach, depending on how far along an automaker is on their journey with software development.\n\nReers states that, ultimately, Accenture\u2019s focus remains on higher-level strategic guidance, organisational transformation, and architecture development. While the acquisition of AOX represents a strategic addition to its SDV offerings to date, it is a single part of a wider effort to transition the automotive industry away from traditional hardware-based mindsets to a more agile and software-oriented paradigm.\n\n\u201cBeyond the minutiae of individual processes and lines of codes, that\u2019s the big challenge we\u2019re looking to address,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThe old model of vehicle design was very successful, but it\u2019s no longer relevant. You need to think and act like a tech company, and that means shifting towards a sprint mindset in which new features don\u2019t come with model updates every year but continuously. That will be difficult without the right expertise on hand.\u201d",

Given the demanding timelines in which automakers aim to realise their software ambitions and the relative lack of industry experience, Reers believes having third parties step in, do the work, and provide guidance on how to achieve similar results could prove highly advantageous.\n\nAccenture and AOX make recommendations based on automakers unique SDV goals, but also offer software components and deep technical expertise. One of AOX\u2019s particular areas of expertise is QNX and other real-time operating systems\u2014 software platforms currently gaining traction in the automotive industry and used in applications where low latency and safety are crucial. Reers notes that demand in such technologies will likely increase as automated driving continues to gain traction.\n\nLifecycle awareness\n\nAnother area in which AOX can assist automakers is code optimisation. This is a universal theme across all software development: the leaner the code and the better it suits the unique capabilities of the hardware on which it is running, the faster and more efficiently the resulting software will perform. \u201cYou need to understand that this is a very restricted environment in terms of memory and compute power,\u201d Horn emphasises. Using the bulk of available processing power and memory at the outset with little consideration for optimisation will inevitably make the addition of new features and updates later in the vehicle\u2019s lifecycle more difficult.\n\nIf you want to build a house, you need to get the architecture right at the start\n\nHe adds that the \u201cmanaging\u201d process of maintaining and iterating vehicle software and its interfaces (APIs) is currently \u201cheavily underestimated\u201d. If a third-party provider updates its software, this may require small tweaks to the vehicle\u2019s operating system or other embedded software to prevent unexpected glitches. \u201cIt used to be that a car was built and then more or less left as it was, but now someone needs to take care of these interfaces for a decade.\u201d AOX can provide guidance on how to manage these lifetime processes or take a more hands-on approach, depending on how far along an automaker is on their journey with software development.\n\nReers states that, ultimately, Accenture\u2019s focus remains on higher-level strategic guidance, organisational transformation, and architecture development. While the acquisition of AOX represents a strategic addition to its SDV offerings to date, it is a single part of a wider effort to transition the automotive industry away from traditional hardware-based mindsets to a more agile and software-oriented paradigm.\n\n\u201cBeyond the minutiae of individual processes and lines of codes, that\u2019s the big challenge we\u2019re looking to address,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThe old model of vehicle design was very successful, but it\u2019s no longer relevant. You need to think and act like a tech company, and that means shifting towards a sprint mindset in which new features don\u2019t come with model updates every year but continuously. That will be difficult without the right expertise on hand.\u201d",

            "content": "Accenture\u2019s Bilal Munir talks about how his role has changed with the growth of GenAI and highlights some of the most important skills he uses.\n\nBilal Munir has always been passionate about mathematics, which led him to a degree in actuarial mathematics at Dublin City University. While there, he landed an internship with Accenture in its data and AI practice.\n\n\u201cIt was one of my career highlights \u2013 real project work, exposure to multiple industries and the ability to apply my coding and statistical skills from university,\u201d he told SiliconRepublic.com.\n\nAfter university, Munir rejoined the company through its graduate programme as a data science analyst in 2021. He then decided to specialise further in data and AI by completing a master\u2019s degree in data analytics at University College Dublin. He now works as a data and AI manager for Accenture.\n\nTell us a bit about what brought you to your current role.\n\nI initially joined Accenture\u2019s global fraud and risk analytics team, so my first few roles were very counter-fraud focused. One of my first projects was around performing network analytics for a UK public sector body. I built and analysed the results of stakeholder interviews to form a directed network of the data-sharing initiatives between different government bodies to identify areas of improvement.\n\nLater, I started working on local projects and spent two years working with a financial client. This role was more of a data engineering and cloud migration role as opposed to a data science role. I gained a lot of experience in areas such as data engineering and architecture, cloud computing and team management. These skills shaped me into a better data scientist and now I have an understanding of the end-to-end data lifecycle (from creation to ingestion and transformation through to deployment and monitoring) and it has given me a more holistic perspective when designing analytics and AI solutions.\n\nAfter my two-year stint in the financial sector, I joined my current client, an Irish public sector body. I initially joined as the lead generative AI (GenAI) developer, bringing a small team of data scientists with me to help build and deploy GenAI prototypes for a small set of business users, proving their value while establishing our client\u2019s AI strategy and responsible AI governance.\n\nI spent the last few months of 2024 helping define our client\u2019s responsible AI foundations, which is currently in an implementation phase. Nowadays, my main priority is to pave the path to production \u2013 to move the gen AI prototypes from testing into production for large-scale use.\n\nHow have you seen your role change with the explosion of GenAI in recent years?\n\nFirstly, it has created a lot of demand \u2013 our clients want to know all about it and want to use it to solve problems that previously were either impossible to solve or they were too expensive to solve. I spend a lot of time with many of our clients in GenAI knowledge-sharing sessions \u2013 what it is and what it is not, what impact it will have on them and their industry, how they need to prepare for it and how to get started.\n\nSecondly, it has been a wake-up call to those that want to deploy GenAI but can\u2019t because they haven\u2019t got the right data foundations in place \u2013 as we in Accenture call it, the \u2018digital core\u2019. Many companies that were previously slow or reluctant in cloud adoption have ramped up efforts in order to make use of the GenAI models that are served by cloud providers.\n\nThere is increased demand in existing work such as cloud migrations and data engineering, which then feeds into and enables the new demand in work relating to GenAI.\n\nHow do data professionals need to adapt in order to be ready for a GenAI world?\n\nOne skill that is common to most data professionals is coding. Code comprehension is one of the major benefits of large language models (LLMs). Developers can use GenAI in some shape or form to help with code issues and for code generation. These can be leveraged in multiple ways (a cloud provider, Microsoft Copilot, Github Copilot etc).\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s still essential for the data professional to have a strong understanding of the code that is ultimately being used and to be able to accurately critique any code that is AI-generated \u2013 no LLM is perfect and overreliance on such tools at this stage will ultimately lead to issues. It\u2019s not a magic solution \u2013 more of an additional tool in your toolkit.\n\nFinally, alongside coding proficiency, all data professionals should strengthen their understanding of responsible AI and model governance, especially given the approaching deadlines of the EU AI Act.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges you face in your current role as AI continues to evolve?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve noticed is how much effort is required to keep up with the incredible speed at which both AI and GenAI is evolving. New tools, frameworks, models and methodologies seem to emerge every week, making it challenging to keep up.\n\nIt\u2019s a great thing, but it also means that an approach you consider optimal today might be outdated in less than a couple months, requiring us to build with change in mind. I like to set aside a few hours each week to explore the latest tools and read the latest and most prominent research papers.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your job?\n\nThe best parts of my job are the people I get to work with \u2013 our clients, our partners and our own people. Working with people who trust and support you \u2013 and whom you can trust as well \u2013 is absolutely essential.\n\nAnother major factor in my personal job satisfaction is flexibility \u2013 the ability to work in a hybrid setting really helps with managing my own work-life balance.\n\nWhat are the most important skills to work in the area of data and AI?\n\nBeing the statistician that I am, I may be a bit biased when I say that a deep understanding of probability, statistics, linear algebra and calculus goes a long way. While you don\u2019t necessarily need a deep dive into the mechanics behind every AI model to leverage them \u2013 just like you can drive a car without knowing how the engine works \u2013 having insight into how these models fundamentally operate helps you anticipate their strengths and limitations.\n\nBeyond that, proficiency in coding and data manipulation is crucial. If you can\u2019t access or prepare your data effectively, then success in AI will be difficult. Another key aspect is a continuous learning mindset, which helps with staying up to date with the latest industry trends.\n\nWhat advice would you give to those considering a career in AI?\n\nThere are many areas one could focus on. I would suggest getting comfortable with Python and SQL, the go-to for most data professionals. Learn what the major cloud providers offer as you\u2019ll more than likely be working with them in some shape or form.\n\nAnd when it comes to the rapidly evolving realm of GenAI, get comfortable with the tools and frameworks that are being used: LangChain, LangGraph and Ragas are a few of the prominent ones.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

Image: Christian Howe/WWF\n\nNew platform uses AI to detect where abandoned fishing gear is likely to be found on seabed floor, replacing time-consuming manual searching\n\nBy Victoria Heath\n\nEvery year, around 640,000 tonnes of ghost gear \u2013 abandoned fishing equipment lost or discarded in the ocean \u2013 ends up in seas around the world. That\u2019s equivalent to more than 1.4 trillion cotton buds.\n\nNow, an AI-supported platform has been developed to combat this vast swathe of pollution, which has previously been notoriously difficult to detect and remove due to its ability to drift in both large and unexpected distances.\n\nWWF Germany, alongside the Microsoft AI for Good Lab and Accenture, has launched the platform \u2013 ghostnetzero.ai \u2013 which uses existing high-resolution sonar data of the seabed to detect where ghost nets are likely to be found around the world.\n\nGhost net recovered by fishermen and detected by the side-scan sonar device off Eckernfo\u0308rde. Image: Christian Howe/WWF\n\nThen, these areas are marked before being validated by a human in a process much quicker than \u2018tedious manual searching\u2019, according to Chief Creative Officer at Accenture Song ASG Thomas Kn\u00fcwer.\n\nEnjoying this article? Check out our related reads:\n\nAlready, the AI can determine the location of ghost gear with an impressive 90 per cent accuracy. Subtle differences between polluting ghost gear, and an underwater cable, for example, are reliably detected by the new system.\n\nThe technology will also allow WWF to extend its search for ghost gear into larger areas of the sea.\n\nAn example of how the technology, ghostnetzero.ai, operates.\n\nSuch a breakthrough is vital for eradicating plastic pollution in our waters: ghost gear makes up around 30 per cent of marine plastic waste, and can have disastrous consequences for marine ecosystems and animals alike. Large nets can continue to pose hazards for aquatic life by entrapping them long after they\u2019ve been discarded due to their durable design; while other fishing gear can continue to decompose in the water and lead to microplastic pollution as they break down into smaller parts.\n\nIt is estimated that up to 2.5 per cent of all fishing gear is lost in the ocean every year, including more than 78,000 sq km of nets, 25 million pots and traps and 740,000 km of longlines.\n\n\u2018Ghost nets endanger marine animals and ecosystems and make up a significant proportion of plastic waste in the ocean, but they are invisible under the water surface and their detection is complex,\u2019 said research diver and project manager at WWF Germany Gabriele Dederer. \u2018The combination of sonar search and AI-supported detection enables a quantum leap: the seabed is mapped all over the world and there is a huge amount of data.\u2019\n\n\u2018If we can specifically check existing image data from heavily fished marine zones, this is a real game-changer in the search for ghost nets. We hope that research institutes, authorities and companies will take part in the collaboration,\u2019 Dederer continued.",

            "content": "This isn\u2019t about \u2018adopting AI\u2019. It\u2019s about rebuilding businesses around it.\n\nJust a couple of years ago AI was being discussed in the usual way\u2014exciting, futuristic, but ultimately distant. It was something to prepare for, not something to actively build around. Companies were still in the mindset of experimentation. Test a chatbot here. Automate a workflow there.\n\nThat moment feels outdated now.\n\nAI is no longer a tool sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be deployed in bits and pieces. It\u2019s here, making decisions, shaping industries, and demanding that businesses reinvent\u2014not in theory, but in practice.\n\nAnd yet, most companies aren\u2019t ready.\n\nThis week I read Accenture\u2019s latest Technology Vision 2025. It confirms what I\u2019ve seen time and time again. AI is shifting from automation to autonomy. It\u2019s no longer about supporting human-led processes\u2014it\u2019s about reshaping them entirely. But while most executives acknowledge this, only 13 per cent say their organisations have seen real AI impact at scale.\n\nThat\u2019s not because AI isn\u2019t advanced enough. It\u2019s because businesses are waiting for clarity instead of creating it.\n\nReinvention comes before readiness\n\nI\u2019ve worked with enough organisations to know that most transformations don\u2019t start because everything is running smoothly. They start when a crisis forces them to. That\u2019s the mistake.\n\nReinvention shouldn\u2019t be a reaction. It should be a strategy.\n\nThe companies that thrive over decades are the ones that moved before they had to. They didn\u2019t wait until their old business model became obsolete. They built the next version of themselves before the market forced them to.\n\nAI is now demanding that same shift\u2014but faster.\n\nAI is no longer just doing. It\u2019s thinking.\n\nI also used to think of AI as an efficiency play. A way to automate processes, speed up decision-making, optimise operations. And that was the first wave. What\u2019s happening now is something else entirely.\n\nBusinesses are moving from static software to AI-powered agents\u2014systems that don\u2019t wait for human input but proactively make decisions.\n\nThat changes everything.\n\nA traditional chatbot answers a customer\u2019s question. An AI agent resolves the issue before the customer even knows there\u2019s a problem. A manual risk assessment process takes weeks. AI evaluates thousands of factors and adjusts in real time.\n\nAI isn\u2019t waiting for permission to change how business works. It\u2019s already doing it.\n\nTrust is the biggest barrier\n\nAccenture\u2019s report highlights a crucial finding: 77 per cent of executives believe AI\u2019s potential depends on trust. And yet, trust is still treated as an afterthought.\n\nI see this in conversations with business leaders. They\u2019re excited about AI, but hesitant. How do we know it\u2019s making the right decisions? How do we ensure it\u2019s ethical? Will people accept it?\n\nThat hesitation is understandable\u2014but it\u2019s also a risk. AI adoption isn\u2019t slowing down. Companies that figure out trust, transparency, and accountability early will lead. The rest will be playing catch-up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about compliance. It\u2019s about confidence. Customers won\u2019t engage with AI systems they don\u2019t understand. Employees won\u2019t rely on AI they don\u2019t trust. Leaders won\u2019t base decisions on AI if they can\u2019t explain its logic.\n\nBuilding AI-first businesses isn\u2019t just about technology. It\u2019s about culture, governance, and leadership.\n\nThe future won\u2019t wait\n\nEvery major shift in business history has created two kinds of companies\u2014those that reinvented early and led, and those that waited too long and faded. AI will be no different.\n\nI\u2019ve had too many conversations with leaders who say they\u2019re \u2018watching the space\u2019. They should be building in it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about \u2018adopting AI\u2019. It\u2019s about rebuilding businesses around it.\n\nThe companies that thrive in the AI-powered future won\u2019t be the ones that simply use AI. They\u2019ll be the ones that think with it, operate with it, and lead with it.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether AI will reshape industries. It already is.\n\nThe real question is: Are you ready to reinvent before you have to?\n\nAt Emerging Europe, we use an integrated approach centred around market intelligence to help organisations understand trends and strategically position themselves for success.\n\nLearn how our solutions can help you thrive in the region:\n\nCompany and Services Overview | Strategic Advantage.",

No, the pope is not out of danger,\" Alfieri said, but added: \"If you then ask whether he is in danger of dying at this moment, the answer is still no.\"Francis has said the papacy is a job for life, but has also left the door open to resigning like his predecessor Benedict XVI.He has often joked about the scheming his health woes inevitably prompt, particularly among those who oppose his attempts at reform.After undergoing colon surgery in 2021, he joked that \"they were preparing the conclave\", the meeting of cardinals to elect a new pope following a death or resignation.- A lot of respect -Italian Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi told the Corriere on Friday he did not rule out Francis stepping down.But Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, who leads the Holy See's powerful Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, said he had heard no particular manoeuvring this time.\"I don't see a pre-conclave environment, I don't see more conversations on a potential successor than there were a year ago,\" he told Argentina's La Nacion daily.\"So far I perceive a lot of respect.\"The pope maintains a punishing work schedule, and in September made a 12-day tour to the Asia-Pacific.But he has suffered increasing health issues, from his colon surgery to a hernia operation in 2023. He is also overweight and suffers constant hip and knee pain, which force him to use a wheelchair most of the time.bur-ar/jj",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other large cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nInvestors continue to favor large-cap stocks, as these companies often serve as the foundation of popular index funds and are well-known among both seasoned professionals and casual traders. Moreover, large-cap firms have demonstrated their ability to withstand economic uncertainty, thanks to their strong market presence and substantial cash reserves, which help them weather financial downturns with relative ease. For the second consecutive year in 2024, US large-cap stocks outpaced cash, bonds, and international equities, securing the top spot in market performance.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA Morningstar report revealed that over the 10-year period ending June 30, 2024, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks by an average of more than 6 percentage points annually. This disparity stems from differences in sector exposure\u2014small-cap benchmarks have a lower concentration of technology stocks and a greater presence in traditional industries like consumer cyclicals, financials, real estate, and industrials. Although economic growth has been robust, these sectors have struggled to match the pace set by technology-related stocks.\n\nIn addition, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management, large-cap stocks play a key role in driving long-term capital appreciation for investors. Over the 10-year period from 2013 to March 2023, large-cap stocks delivered a total return of 162%, outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which posted returns of 139% and 108%, respectively.\n\nLarge-cap stocks demonstrate their resilience through their ability to increase dividends even in times of market distress. Several leading companies have maintained decades-long streaks of dividend growth, weathering major economic crises such as the 2008 recession and the 2020 pandemic. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that large-cap firms with a track record of consistent dividend increases have shown relative strength during downturns, suffering smaller losses than the broader market. In addition, these companies have often outperformed during periods of market stagnation and have participated in a substantial share of gains during bull markets.\n\nDividend growth is a key factor when evaluating dividend stocks, as companies that consistently raise their payouts have historically outperformed those that do not. A report by RMB Capital found that between 1972 and 2018, companies that initiated or grew their dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.62%, significantly surpassing the 2.40% return of non-dividend-paying firms. Even the broader market, with a 7.30% return, lagged behind dividend growers. The report also emphasized that companies with a strong history of dividend increases have not only sustained but expanded their payouts, even during economic downturns. From a portfolio perspective, dividend growth stocks provide solid diversification, as they are spread across multiple industries. This offers an advantage over high-yield portfolios, which tend to be concentrated in mature sectors like utilities and, prior to 2007, financials.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The landscape of DEI has changed significantly over the past couple of months in the US. Some companies have followed Trump\u2019s executive orders to roll back their DEI initiatives, while others stand firm in their diversity and inclusion stances.\n\nWith so many changes to DEI in a short matter of time, it isn\u2019t easy to keep up with where companies stand with DEI. This is why POCIT is creating a new series where we update you on the latest changes to DEI every month.\n\nRemember to revisit this page throughout February for updates.\n\nAccenture\n\nAfter evaluating the political landscape in the US, Accenture recently announced that it would scrap its global diversity and inclusion goals, as stated by The Financial Times. Chief executive Julie Sweet sent a memo to staff explaining that the company would be \u201csunsetting\u201d its diversity goals set in 2017. It also plans to end its career development programs for \u201cpeople of specific demographic groups.\u201d\n\nDisney\n\nWalt Disney Co. is withdrawing diversity from the basis for deciding manager compensation, according to Bloomberg. Leaders will now be evaluated on how well they endorse company values and embody different perspectives. It will also end its Reimagine Tomorrow inclusion program. Staff were told of these changes in an announcement by Chief Human Resources Officer Sonia Coleman.\n\n\u201cWhat won\u2019t change is our commitment to fostering a company culture where everyone belongs, and everyone can excel, enabling us to deliver the globally appealing entertainment that drives our business,\u201d Coleman shared in the memo.\n\nThe company is also updating the language of its content warnings. Previously, users received auto-play content advisory disclaimers that would appear for older films on Disney+ like \u201cDumbo\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d These warnings would tell viewers that the film includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or cultures.\u201d\n\nNow, the warning will say \u201cThis program is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions.\u201d\n\nMcKinsey\n\nMcKinsey & Co. is not joining the list of companies scrapping their DEI efforts; it pledges to prioritize diversity across its workforce, as reported by Bloomberg. Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels told staff in a memo that some people have asked if the company plans to continue to prioritize diversity in their meritocracy.\n\n\u201cThe answer is yes. We will continue to boldly pursue both because these two things together \u2014 our diverse meritocracy \u2014 is what makes us distinctive and has defined who we are over our nearly 100 years,\u201d he said.\n\nDeloitte\n\nDeloitte recently shared that it would scrap its diversity goals and urged government contract employees to remove gender pronouns from their email signatures, according to The Financial Times. The firm told consultants to remove pronouns highlighting their gender from external emails to align with emerging government client practices and requirements,\u201d as stated by people with similar details.\n\nHowever, Deloitte\u2019s UK senior partner and chief executive Richard Houston informed staff in an email that diversity \u201cremains a priority\u201d despite the US firm\u2019s plans for DEI.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nNot long ago, Goldman Sachs announced that it had removed a policy intended to promote diversity on the boards of companies that it takes public. The policy, introduced in 2020, stated that Goldman would only enlist a company\u2019s starting public offering if it had at least one board member from a diverse background.\n\nThe Guardian reported that Goldman said, \u201cAs a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy.\u201d\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle\u2019s online and mobile calendars no longer reference Black History Month, Women\u2019s History Month, LGBTQ+ holidays, and other events. The Verge first reported that the calendars previously highlighted the beginning of Black History Month in February and Pride Month in June, but these events do not exist for 2025.\n\nMadison Cushman Veld, a Google spokesperson, gave The Guardian a statement about the calendar: \u201cSome years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries around the world. We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing \u2013 and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable.\u201d\n\nPBS\n\nFollowing President Trump\u2019s executive orders, PBS is closing its Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) office. NBC reviewed a memo sent to staff by PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger stating that on the advice of PBS\u2019 legal counsel, the DEI office was shut, and DEI staffers Gina Leow and Cecilia Loving will leave PBS.\n\n\u201cIn order to best ensure we are in compliance with the President\u2019s executive order around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion we have closed our DEI office,\u201d they said in the memo.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are the key catalysts driving trends in the semiconductor market. Likewise, the market is expected to grow by $157.1 billion at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% by 2029, as per estimates by Technavio. The growth would be fueled by the growing need for chips to power the telecom sector, automotive, consumer electronics, IT and communications, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and consumer goods.\n\nSimilarly, the growing demand for semiconductors brought on by emerging technologies like 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents serious challenges for the semiconductor industry. Two to four million gallons of ultra-pure water are needed every day at a single semiconductor fabrication plant, which uses about one Terawatt-hour (TWh) of energy annually.\n\nAdditionally, tussles between nations could pose significant challenges to the semiconductor sector, consequently hindering the development of artificial intelligence innovations. Countries passing protectionist measures to curb access to advanced semiconductors are seen as one hindrance to the robust growth projected.\n\nIn addition to its potential to improve access to food, healthcare, and education, artificial intelligence (AI) can also aid in developing biological and other weapons, support cyber attacks, aid in surveillance, and contribute to other human rights violations.\n\n\u201cThe potential military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled applications of these technologies and products pose risks to U.S. national security particularly when developed by a country of concern such as the PRC,\u201d the Treasury Department notification said.\n\nThe US has already passed restrictions on Chinese firm\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors and equipment developed by US companies. The restrictions come amid concerns that China\u2019s gaining access to advanced semiconductors could pose significant security risks in the future.\n\nChina has also hit back with similar measures. China has blasted the United States for imposing new export restrictions on semiconductors made in the United States, which Washington believes Beijing may use to create the next generation of weapons and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has to be prepared for rapid increases in AI\u2019s capability in the coming years, which could have a transformative impact on the economy and on our national security,\u201d U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.\n\nAccording to US Commerce Department officials, the new controls were intended to undermine China\u2019s domestic semiconductor industry and slow the country\u2019s development of sophisticated AI weapons that could be used in conflict, which pose a threat to US and allied national security. The US was accused of \u201cabusing\u201d export controls, and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry denounced the action, calling it \u201ca significant threat\u201d to the stability of global supply chains and industry.\n\nAmid the robust growth in the semiconductor sector amid a string of protectionist measures by the US and China, there are tremendous opportunities worth pursuing. The development of powerful semiconductors has opened the door for exciting and unique AI innovations increasingly driving stock valuations and shareholder value.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is an information technology company that provides strategy, consulting technology, and operation services. It offers systems integration, application management, software engineering data, and AI and automation services. On February 11th, the company entered into a strategic collaboration with Google Cloud to accelerate the adoption of cloud solutions and generative AI capabilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe strategic collaboration seeks to make it easy for organizations to leverage advanced technologies like AI to generate new business opportunities and improve customer experiences. The same should be achieved by establishing a contemporary digital core and scaling generative AI agents to improve enterprise intelligence and operational efficiency. The use of generative AI has the potential to increase the Kingdom\u2019s gross domestic product by 4%, which is one of the reasons Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and Google Cloud are collaborating to advance AI initiatives.\n\nOverall ACN ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, the CEO will continue to look after the day-to-day operations of the IT services and consulting firm during the treatment.\n\n\u201cI was very recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The good news is that the prognosis from my doctor is excellent; the cancer was caught early, and my condition is curable,\u201d Sweet reportedly told Accenture employees in an internal email.\n\nScans have confirmed that there was no evidence of cancer elsewhere in the body, her letter added. After a surgery next week, Sweet's further treatment would involve radiation.\n\nAccenture is one of the largest IT services employers with around 3 lakh staff in India.\n\n\"As stated in the memo Julie sent to our people, her prognosis is excellent, the cancer was caught early, and her condition is curable. She will work substantially as normal, and continue to lead the day-to-day operation of the company,\" Moneycontrol reported citing an Accenture spokesperson.\n\nHowever, she will curtail travel during the period. Accenture\u2019s Board has been briefed and is fully supportive of the developments.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible Global Management Committee, supported by our amazing teams around the world. I am confident that we will continue to do what we do best- deliver 360\u00b0 value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners, and communities,\u201d Sweet's mail read further.\n\nSweet was appointed Accenture CEO in September 2019. Previously, she served as chief executive officer of Accenture's business in North America, the company's largest geographic market.\n\nShe also serves on the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.\n\n",

            "content": "Consulting.us\n\nConsulting giant Accenture is scrapping its DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring strategy and ending career development programs for \u201cpeople of specific demographic groups,\u201d according to a memo from CEO Julie Sweet.\n\nThis makes Accenture the latest large company to ditch their DEI goals following a series of executive orders from US President Donald Trump that cut DEI programs within the federal government - and which also seek to end the programs in any companies that do business with the federal government.\n\nRegistered in Ireland for tax purposes, Accenture is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and much of its global revenue comes from contracts in the US.\n\n\u201cWe are and always have been a meritocracy,\u201d said Sweet in the memo, referring to the idea that the company hires based on experience, skill, and potential.\n\n\u201cWe are and always have been committed to an inclusive, merit-based workplace free from bias, and a culture in which all our people are respected and have equal opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe crux of the criticism of DEI hiring is that it can amount to a \"box-checking exercise,\" with companies hiring more people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations solely for the purpose of meeting quotas. Trump has called DEI programs \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d\n\nDespite canning the programs, Sweet simultaneously pointed to their success, noting in the memo that the firm has largely achieved its diversity targets, with a 30% ratio of female managing directors. The firm was also recently awarded a perfect score by The Human Rights Campaign for being a leader in \u201cLGBTQ+ workplace inclusion.\u201d\n\nThese changes also come despite Accenture reaffirming its \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to DEI as recently as October of last year. Some of those goals included hiring more employees of certain races, like African American, Hispanic, and Indian.\n\nFederal contracts\n\nThe move does not exactly come as a surprise, considering the large amount of fees consulting firms such as Accenture garner from federal contracts.\n\nThe rationale for ditching DEI is that if Accenture continued with its DEI programs, it could face a vengeful Trump administration cancelling all of these contracts. The Trump administration has laid a legal minefield that any firm with federal contracts will need to cautiously navigate.\n\nAccenture Federal Services (AFS) is a subsidiary of Accenture established specifically to offer consulting services to the US federal government. AFS holds numerous contracts with the US government across various departments and agencies.\n\nLast year AFS signed a $250 million contract with the US Department of the Interior for an IT project and a $1.6 billion contract to enhance the US Air Force, to give just two examples. And 2025 has already started with a bang for AFS, with a $3.5 billion contract signed with the Department of Energy to provide IT services.\n\nOne Reddit user on the subreddit for employees of Accenture put it bluntly: \u201cYou can see the way the wind is blowing. It\u2019s just a matter of time until federal contracts with any company engaged in DEI are cancelled. It\u2019s about money.\u201d\n\nCEO holds a \"town hall\"\n\nCEO Julie Sweet was said to have held a \"town hall\" meeting within the past several days, though it was not a public event. In this town hall it appears that she clarified what the coming changes will entail and took questions from employees.\n\nPerhaps Reddit is often used for venting and complaining, but if the general sentiment in the Accenture subreddit is at all indicative of the wider atmosphere in the firm\u2019s offices, there is a lot of frustration and bitterness. Posts and comments there have been overwhelmingly critical.\n\n\u201cI asked if this decision is going to be reversed in four years but they didn\u2019t read my question. Weird...\u201d was one comment in a post about the town hall.\n\nAnother chimed in: \u201cThey didn\u2019t answer any of my questions either! This is a terrible company.\u201d Still another lamented: \u201cA whole lot of nothing and empty buzzwords.\u201d\n\nPivot to \"meritocracy\"\n\nThere had already been a shift occurring in the consulting world: A shift away from a perceived \u2018elitism\u2019 towards \u2018meritocracy\u2019, in which employees are recruited based on their skills and potential, not on their degree or connections.\n\nThis trend in hiring appeared to be an attempt to address criticism of top consultancies hiring based on connections, alma mater, or socio-economic background. But Julie Sweet has now pushed the meritocracy discourse in a new way: Attempting to turn a negative (trashing diversity and inclusion) into a positive (hiring based on merit), despite DEI having nothing to do with elitism.\n\nDonald Trump and other Republicans have been pushing this anti-elitism discourse for years. Trump has used the term \"elite\" as an insult to disparage the Democratic Party and other \"establishment\" organizations, like mainstream media outlets. This rhetoric arrives alongside Trump, a Manhattan real estate baron, teaming up with elite billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, and others\n\nAs the tide shifts in the US and DEI is politically deprecated, the consulting world is likely to follow suit. So-called \"woke\" policies began gaining ground in the wake of anti-racism protests in 2020 when many companies felt huge pressure to enact DEI programs. Many firms will now likely reverse course to fall in line with the current political climate.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nGlobal professional services firm Accenture announced last week it would sunset its global employee representation goals and other diversity, equity and inclusion programs to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive orders, according to an internal memo shared with ESG Dive.\n\nAccenture CEO Julie Sweet announced the program changes in an email to all employees on Feb. 6. In addition to scrapping representation goals, Sweet announced that the company will also cut career development programs for specific demographics and stop submitting to external diversity benchmarking surveys.\n\nSweet\u2019s email cites Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting private sector DEI programs as the impetus for the changes. She said the changes \u2014 which will also entail Accenture no longer using its diversity goals to measure performance \u2014 are a result of the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued evaluation of [its] internal policies and practices and the evolving landscape in the United States.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nImmediately following his inauguration Jan. 20, Trump issued a number of executive orders aimed at rolling back his predecessor\u2019s DEI policies and followed with the Jan. 21 order for agencies to target private sector programs. Accenture joins a growing number of companies that have altered or rolled back their corporate DEI initiatives in the new year, following a wave of rollbacks in 2024.\n\nSweet\u2019s memo came a day after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Department of Justice will \u201cinvestigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector\u201d and educational institutions. Accenture\u2019s CEO told employees that in lieu of its representation goals, the company will put \u201ca greater focus on inclusion and a sense of belonging for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are and always have been a meritocracy,\u201d Sweet told employees. \u201cWe are and always have been committed to an inclusive, merit-based workplace free from bias, and a culture in which all our people are respected, feel a sense of belonging and have equal opportunity.\u201d\n\nAccenture first rolled out employee representation goals in 2017, before updating them in 2020, according to Sweet\u2019s memo. Among those was a goal to have a gender-balanced workforce by this year, according to an archived version of the company\u2019s website. As of 2023, the most recently reported year, around 64% of Accenture\u2019s workforce identified as men, while around 35% identified as women, according to the company\u2019s workforce demographics.\n\nGoing forward, Accenture will make updates and continue to evaluate its company policies \u201cto ensure they support [Accenture\u2019s] business strategy, are effective, inclusive, fit the needs of all our people, comply with applicable laws globally, and address the continually evolving landscape,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nIn ending its career development programs for specific demographics, Accenture will instead increase its investment in its \u201ccore career development programs.\u201d While the company pauses its external diversity benchmarking submissions, it will also evaluate its continued participation, as well as its external partnerships.\n\nThough the information technology services company will cease survey participation, Sweet said it will continue to report demographics publicly in markets it currently does. Additionally, she said Accenture will continue to support employee resource groups and its commitment to global pay equity.\n\n\u201cWe have always believed that attracting, hiring and developing people who have different backgrounds, different perspectives and different experiences are essential to driving innovation and serving global companies across multiple industries,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nThe memo\u2019s focus on inclusion tracks closely with recommendations given by Chai Feldblum, a former Democratic commissioner for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in a LinkedIn post last week. While Feldblum said Bondi\u2019s order could create \u201ctrouble in the courts\u201d if interpreted too broadly, she suggested companies could frame their programs as commitments to creating inclusive and fair workplaces that ensure no one is discriminated against.\n\nCompanies who have altered their DEI policies since the new year have stretched across industries and include McDonald\u2019s, Meta, Amazon, Target and Google shifting away from diversity hiring goals, supplier diversity goals and more in the past two months. Many of the same companies have accompanied the sunsetting of certain DEI initiatives with a shift in emphasis to \u201cinclusion.\u201d",

We are unique because our strategy brings together key stakeholders to pioneer digital sovereignty and to develop systems that are not only secure and compliant but also resilient and future ready,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts from both companies will work with clients to identify use cases and rapidly develop and scale them, enabling organizations to benefit from the advantages of generative AI while maintaining security and compliance through Google\u2019s Dammam cloud region.\n\n\u201cOrganizations need the combination of leading technology and services expertise to successfully deploy generative AI,\u201d said Bader Almadi, general manager of Google Cloud in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWith Google Cloud\u2019s advanced capabilities and Accenture\u2019s industry expertise, customers will have access to the resources needed to plan, deploy and optimize generative AI projects.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its technology initiatives, this partnership will also help foster local talent in the region, and include hackathons, training programs and hands-on lab environments.

AI initiatives are crucial for Saudi Arabia as they align with Vision 2030, driving economic diversification and reducing reliance on oil. AI enhances efficiency across industries like healthcare, finance, and smart cities, fostering innovation and global competitiveness. It also supports workforce development by equipping citizens with future-ready skills. Additionally, AI-powered solutions improve government services, security, and sustainability efforts. This week ERP provider IFS also announced that it is partnering with Saudi Business Machines (SBM) to extend its footprint in the region.\n\nOrganizations are seeing the benefits of AI. At a pivotal time for digital transformation, organizations are leveraging sovereign cloud and generative AI to drive innovation. In Saudi Arabia, the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) exemplifies this shift, using AI to enhance social insurance services for customers and their families. With a commitment to innovation and excellence, GOSI built a secure, scalable AI environment on cloud technology. This initiative empowers developers and researchers to experiment with cutting-edge AI models, delivering tangible outcomes and extending the value of AI across its operations.\n\nGenerative AI is fueling ERP market growth. Generative AI is transforming the ERP market by automating workflows, enhancing data-driven decision-making, and improving user experiences. AI-powered ERP systems analyze vast datasets to generate insights, optimize resource allocation, and predict market trends. This results in greater efficiency, cost savings, and faster response times for businesses. Additionally, AI-driven automation reduces manual workloads, allowing employees to focus on strategic tasks. As companies seek smarter, more adaptive ERP solutions, generative AI is fueling market growth and reshaping enterprise resource planning.",

That\u2019s good news, right?\n\nWell, don\u2019t pop the champagne just yet.\n\nSince the ratification of the Paris Climate Accords in 2016, 49% have actually been emitting more every year.\n\nOn the plus side, a little more than a third of industrial companies (35%) have set full net zero targets, meaning they are committed to fully decarbonize their operations and wider value chains by 2050, according to recent Accenture research. However, this leaves two-thirds not planning to fully decarbonize. And not even half (14%) of industrial companies are on track to reach their goal.\n\nThe bottom-line is that, since 2016, industrial companies have reduced their CO2 emissions by exactly 0.0%.\n\nSome people would argue that flat emissions are already a success, and what companies have already achieved shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Indeed, most have already adopted five foundational reduction levers. Namely, 85% have been increasing their overall energy efficiency, 84% have been reducing waste and adopting circular principles, 82% are using renewable energy sources and 77% are decarbonizing buildings such as factories and warehouses.\n\nUntapped opportunities for industrial emissions reduction\n\nDespite the high levels of action on a number of industrial sustainability fronts, manufacturers are still leaving promising opportunities untapped. Following are the top three areas that deserve greater attention from industry:\n\nWiden the focus: Industry\u2019s focus on the five foundational decarbonization levers has a downside, which is a lack of enthusiasm for taking additional measures. But the more levers a company uses, the faster it decarbonizes. Our research shows that organizations adopting 15 or more levers have cut their emissions by nearly 2% annually since 2016.",

The initiative aims to help organizations create new business opportunities and improve customer experiences by establishing a modern digital core and scaling generative AI agents to enhance operational efficiency and enterprise intelligence.\n\nFrom left to right: Bader Almadi, Google Cloud KSA Country Managing Director, Alison Wagonfeld, Google Cloud CMO, Dr. Majid Altuwaijri, Accenture\u2019s KSA chair and country managing director, Marta Lajmi, Accenture Google Business Group Lead in Middle East , Giampiero Terzi, Accenture Technology lead in Middle East , Ibrahim Cinar, Google Cloud Channels lead for Middle East , Turkey , Africa . (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority in collaboration with Accenture, the adoption of generative AI has the potential to increase Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product by four percent. To address this unique opportunity, Accenture will collaborate with Google Cloud to advance AI initiatives locally.\n\nBuilding on their global collaboration, Accenture and Google Cloud will extend their joint Generative AI Center of Excellence (CoE) to Saudi Arabia to provide organizations with cutting-edge industry solutions, products and assets, including generative AI agents. This expansion can help rapidly transform ideas into tangible value by combining the latest Google Cloud technologies with Accenture\u2019s industry-tested solutions and services with significant generative AI projects in production. Experts from both companies will work closely with clients to identify transformative use cases and rapidly develop and scale them in production for strategic advancements. The collaboration will help enable organizations to harness the power of generative AI while maintaining data security and compliance through Google\u2019s Dammam cloud region.\n\n\u201cBeing ready for continuous reinvention hinges on a modern digital core to rapidly seize every opportunity. We\u2019re expanding our joint Accenture and Google Cloud Generative AI CoE to bring new capabilities to the region and transform how Saudi organizations can reinvent products, services and experiences,\u201d said Dr. Majid Altuwaijri, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia chair and country managing director at Accenture. \u201cOur partnership with Google Cloud aims to help clients in Saudi Arabia accelerate business outcomes in new ways. We are unique because our strategy brings together key stakeholders to pioneer digital sovereignty and to develop systems that are not only secure and compliant but also resilient and future ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrganizations need the combination of leading technology and services expertise to successfully deploy generative AI,\u201d said Bader Almadi, country manager of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at Google Cloud. \u201cWith Google Cloud\u2019s advanced capabilities and Accenture\u2019s industry expertise, customers will have access to the resources needed to plan, deploy and optimize generative AI projects.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration arrives at a decisive moment for organizations across diverse industries seeking to expedite their digital journeys and derive the value of sovereign cloud and generative AI across their enterprise. For example, the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) has a powerful mission to provide innovative social insurance products and services to all participants and their families in Saudi Arabia .\n\nDriven by their core values of innovation and excellence, GOSI recently applied the power of generative AI capabilities to rapidly design and prototype a scalable, secure AI environment built on cloud technology. This initiative has enabled GOSI\u2019s developers, data scientists, and researchers to experiment hands-on with the latest AI models, tools, and technologies, extending the value of AI and sovereign cloud through tangible outcomes.\n\nIn addition to advancing the impact of scaling generative AI, Accenture and Google Cloud are committed to fostering local talent and skills. Their local collaboration will include training programs, hackathons and hands-on labs to experiment and equip professionals with the necessary skills to capitalize on the potential of cloud and generative AI effectively. This focus on skilling and talent development is crucial for driving sustainable growth and innovation in Saudi Arabia . For example, local clients and citizens can now tap into Accenture\u2019s technology training and learning services through Accenture LearnVantage for tailored upskilling programs; specialized, predesigned technology academies; ecosystem certification services; and managed services for a client\u2019s own learning capabilities.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nExcept for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Accenture ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nHow Fast Is Accenture Growing?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Accenture has grown EPS by 7.4% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Accenture remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 2.7% to US$66b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Accenture's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can .\n\nAre Accenture Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$241b company like Accenture. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$168m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.07% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nIs Accenture Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nOne positive for Accenture is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. If you think Accenture might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check .\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

We are and always have been committed to an inclusive, merit-based workplace free from bias, and a culture in which all our people are respected, feel a sense of belonging and have equal opportunity,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cThis commitment is embedded in our enduring Core Values of client value creation, one global network, respect for the individual, best people, integrity and stewardship, and in our Leadership Essentials.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s policy change followed an \u201cevaluation of our internal policies and practices and the evolving landscape in the United States, including recent executive orders with which we must comply\u201d, said Sweet.\n\nThis was in reference to Donald Trump\u2019s 22 January executive order to terminate \u201cradical DEI preferencing in federal contracting and directing federal agencies to relentlessly combat private sector discrimination.\u201d\n\nAs well as the separate announcement from US Attorney General, Pam Bondi issuing a memorandum on 5 February, directing the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and Office of Legal Policy to jointly submit a report, by March, to include proposals for criminal investigations and for up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of entities that are defined by the executive order.\n\nThese entities include publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of US$500 million dollars or more, state and local bar and medical associations and institutions of higher education with endowments over US$1 billion.\n\n\u201cRecommendations for enforcing federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including policies relating to DEI and DEIA\u201d.\n\nAccenture\u2019s 360 Value Report for 2024 shows that the company was \u201cstriving to foster a culture and workplace in which all our people feel a sense of belonging and are respected, which empowers them to do their best work\u201d.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Sweet in her memo,\n\nThe report showed that 48 per cent of its global workforce were women, compared to its global goal of gender parity by 2025, while 30 per cent of its managing directors were women, in line with its global goal of 30 per cent women by 2025.\n\nAccording to Accenture, 131,000 new employees completed unconscious bias training, with approximately 143,000 allies in action participants and 45 accessibility centres available across 22 countries.\n\nIn its report Accenture said it strives \u201cto build accessibility practices into our work and provide our clients with the tools and knowledge to implement these practices themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe partner with clients on focused solutions for inclusion and diversity strategy, inclusive leadership and culture, and talent systems equity,\u201d said Accenture.\n\n\u201cThese services include individual and organisational assessments, workshops and programs to create conscious inclusion, talent maximisation strategies and inclusion and diversity coaching.\u201d\n\nSweet in her memo echoed these sentiments, stating the consultancy firm\u2019s \u201cbusiness strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients, supported by our talent strategy to attract and retain the best people who innovate to drive reinvention\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also believe the most successful companies in the next decade will be those that have the broadest access to talent, are talent creators and are able to unlock the potential of their talent through, among other things, their employee value proposition. We invest in learning and development for our people (more than US$1 billion and 40 million training hours in FY24) and to create meaningful employee experiences for all,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough Sweet confirmed Accenture would continue to support \u201cimportant Employee Resource Groups and Networks, which are open to all of its people and have broad participation, membership and allyship.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing our processes for pay equity globally,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd as with any strategy, we will continue to use our employee data to understand the effectiveness of our strategy.

Gurjot Ahluwalia, who plans to retire with financial independence in 2025 , recently posted on social media announcing his current net worth of Rs 5 crore, calling it his biggest achievement of 2024. He also shared a screenshot of an app, showing his net worth at Rs 5 crore and liabilities at just Rs 2.7 lakh.Ahluwalia attributed his financial success to three key strategies. First, he focused on advancing his career to earn a higher income. Second, he practiced delayed gratification and saved aggressively. Finally, equity investments played a crucial role in growing his net worth to Rs 5 crore in 11 years. His achievement has left the internet quite inspired.He however noted that his journey from a salaried middle-class person to a net worth of Rs 5 crore was made possible by two key factors: no debt, as his education was paid for by his parents and no rent because he lived with his parents. He also admitted that the recent market corrections had reduced his net worth by 8-10 per cent. The Indian equity market benchmark index Nifty is down over 10 per cent from its last year's highs while the correction in mid-cap and small-cap have been higher.When asked about his liabilities by a netizen, Gurjot Ahluwalia said he was travelling to Dubai during that time. Generally, he tries to keep liabilities under Rs 1 lakh, he added. In one of the videos he has shared on internet, he emphasized the age-old wisdom why time in the stock market is more important than timing the market, drawing from his own example.In a subsequent tweet, he said that \"investing is hard. But working 9-5 for 40 years is harder.\"Netizens agreed with him. \"Investing may be challenging, but the potential rewards and the freedom it offers are worth the effort,\" said a netizen.Netizens were quick to shower praise on the individual\u2019s impressive financial journey, applauding his smart investment strategies and disciplined approach. Many congratulated him, calling him a smart and sensible investor. Others highlighted the importance of consistency, patience, and delayed gratification in building wealth.One user emphasized how instant gratification often erodes wealth, while another noted that his success reflects the value of long-term investing and financial discipline. Some pointed out that while replicating specific stock picks may be challenging, the key takeaway is the power of patience and investing over time. Others highlighted the importance of high income, consistent savings, and equity ownership as crucial factors in achieving financial independence.A netizen said that many investors may not be able to replicate his stock-picking, but what stands out is the value of investing over long periods of time and exercising extreme patience. And delayed gratification. Another netizen congratulated him for pointing out the benefit of high income, savings, and business ownership (through equity investing).Sharing their own goal, a netizen wrote, \"Congratulations! I hope to achieve this by 2030. Rent is biggest expense in city like Mumbai, achieving a million dollar corpus while paying rent for 15-20 years is really difficult for salaried class. But high salary and discipline can help one achieve this milestone.\"According to Gurjot Ahluwalia's LinkedIn profile, he currently is a senior manager at Accenture Strategy and earlier he had worked as a Relationship Manager with the wealth management unit of a private bank. He did his MBA from FORE School of Management, New Delhi, after completing BTech from Chandigarh Engineering College.",

In 2022, the firm released its initial two-year \u2018Innovate\u2019 Reconciliation Action Plan, the second phase of four in the RAP program.\n\nAmong its RAP commitments, the firm aimed to develop and implement a First Nations recruitment, retention and professional development strategy, increase the percentage of First Nations employees in its workforce, actively provide employment and upskilling opportunities and set targets for Indigenous recruitment, and incorporate the changes into policies and KPI\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAccenture\u2019s position affords us both an extraordinary opportunity and a huge responsibility to make a difference,\u201d A/NZ chief executive Peter Burns said at the time. \u201cWe have a strong Australian heritage that drives us to both celebrate the contributions of First Nations peoples and to try to address the longstanding inequities that have persisted in this country across generations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel at least a little bit gas-lit by Accenture\u2019s reversal, as the consultancy, led by Sweet, has been among the most vocal proponents of workplace diversity, including as recently as in the staff memo; \u201cWe have always believed that attracting, hiring and developing people who have different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences is essential to driving innovation.\u201d",

However, the final product remains a testament to human craftsmanship, featuring a unique visual style crafted through 2D hand animation and 3D procedural rendering (Houdini).\n\nFor Accenture Song, the creative goal was simplicity\u2014cutting through the noise to deliver OpenAI\u2019s vision for the Intelligence Age in a direct, visually compelling manner. Sora served as an experimental tool for rapid ideation, allowing creatives to explore a variety of concepts before refining their final approach.\n\n\u2018The Intelligence Age\u2019 uses a pointillism-inspired animation style, drawing from OpenAI\u2019s core brand identity and the ChatGPT interface. Throughout the ad, a single data point\u2014referred to as \u2018The Point\u2019\u2014transforms into moving iconography, illustrating key moments of human progress leading up to AI\u2019s emergence. This visual metaphor reflects OpenAI\u2019s foundational philosophy: every idea, breakthrough, and innovation begins with a single observation, a single point.\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018The Point\u2019 is not just a symbol\u2014it underpins OpenAI\u2019s identity system, influencing its typeface, iconography, and design language. It also appears in the ChatGPT interface, making it a familiar visual cue for users. In the ad, \u2018The Point\u2019 serves as a reminder that AI, like all human advancements, is a tool born from curiosity, research, and discovery.\n\nThrough \u2018The Intelligence Age,\u2019 OpenAI hopes to spark curiosity and inspire individuals to explore the new possibilities AI can bring into their lives. The Super Bowl ad is not just a commercial\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to be part of a defining moment in technological history.",

            "content": "In a little more than a week, legions of volunteers will fan out across Los Angeles County to count people who are homeless. Over the course of three nights (Feb. 18-20) volunteers will walk or drive across the county, armed with maps of their assigned census tracts, a smartphone app for listing their tally, and instructions not to intrude upon the people who will be counted. No lifting the flaps of a tent you come across.\n\nVolunteers arrive at about 150 deployment centers, where they get flashlights and maps and assemble into small groups for the annual point-in-time count, part of a nationwide effort that usually happens in January, but which Los Angeles delayed because of the wildfires. Already instructed on how to judge whether someone is probably homeless, volunteers note whether they counted an individual, a tent, a makeshift dwelling or a car. There is no guessing how many people might be in a tent. Those estimations are done later by researchers.\n\nSome volunteers do speak to the homeless individuals they encounter. Last year, in Lincoln Heights, a group of three counters in one car came across a bus stop where a man and a woman with a fair amount of belongings stood. Were they people waiting for a bus? Were they homeless people with their belongings \u2014 perhaps also waiting for a bus? Someone in the car rolled down the window and explained that they were on the homeless count. The woman standing at the bus stop proclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m one of \u2018em!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an imperfect venture, of course. But there is no other undertaking that brings out roughly 5,000 volunteers over three nights not just to see homeless people but to feel the cold air and walk through the darkness. It\u2019s uncomfortable and sometimes a little scary (although volunteers are always told to put their personal safety first and not enter any area that feels unsafe). And that\u2019s a tiny glimpse of what L.A. nights are like for homeless people.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but wonder literally, \u2018What is it like to live on the concrete?\u2019\u201d says Va Lecia Adams Kellum, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which organizes and runs the count. Adams Kellum will go out on each of the nights. She says LAHSA could never afford enough professional counters to replace volunteers. \u201cAnd we lose community engagement if we do,\u201d she adds. Part of the experience of being on the count, she said, is \u201cknowing the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nThe agency tallies people living in shelters and other temporary housing as well. (Glendale, Pasadena and Burbank do their own separate counts.) The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority also does a weeks-long demographic survey that is conducted by USC\u2019s School of Social Work, which uses paid data collectors.\n\nIt\u2019s already underway, and nearly 3,000 unhoused people had been interviewed as of late January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are other private-sector, professional studies of street homelessness. The Rand research organization has done long-term surveys of unhoused people. In a study of Venice, Skid Row and Hollywood \u2014 three communities with large homeless populations in Los Angeles \u2014 from late 2021 to late 2022, Rand researchers found increases in homelessness. In contrast, the county\u2019s point-in-time count in January 2023 found decreases in those communities. Such variation only underscores the need for continued data collection and analysis, including the point-in-time count.\n\nThe tally a year ago registered a 2.2% drop in homelessness in the city of Los Angeles, and found the rate flat in the county overall. More dramatically, it showed a 10.4% drop in the number of homeless people living unsheltered (as opposed to in shelters and temporary housing) in the city and a 5.1% drop in the county.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch data are important and valuable for policymakers. But some of the most profound lessons \u2014 what volunteers experience when they go out into the night \u2014 can\u2019t be conveyed in numbers. You just have to be there.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 9 Must-See AI News Updates That Are Trending on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCNBC recently spoke to companies worldwide on how DeepSeek\u2019s new AI models will likely impact their operations and financials. Roadzen, a technology company using artificial intelligence to disrupt the auto insurance sector, was asked how things are now different with DeepSeek releasing its R1 model.\n\nAccording to its chief executive Rohan Malhotra, his company helps its insurance underwriting clients speed up claim processing, cutting the time to resolve 80% of minor accident claims from six weeks to two minutes. Since the nature of processing such claims is sensitive, the company has been using sophisticated AI models that produce accurate results, such as those from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. However, things may be different now that DeepSeek is in the picture.\n\n\u201cOur clients cannot afford a model which has 60%-70% accuracy, that\u2019s like a major economic issue. We need to deploy models that have 95%-99% accuracy.\u201d\n\nRough calculations reveal that the company may be able to incur costs 50% lower using DeepSeek than the costs incurred with OpenAI\u2019s models.\n\n\u201cWhat we really care about is the cost of inference. We care about the accuracy of the outputs. And we care about whether this model is performing to the certain benchmarks that we\u2019ve set, in a good way\".\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nBesides cost efficiencies, other companies have lauded the decision to keep the technology open source, stating that it makes it more attractive compared to existing open-source models like Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama. Another company excited with the advent of DeepSeek is a North Carolina-based eldercare platform CareYaya. Neal K. Shah, CEO, told CNBC that their company has started using AI to help customers fight health insurance claims denials.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek just lowered our costs by 90% so we can help more people,\u201d he said in a message. \u201cThe average cost to appeal a U.S. health insurance claims denial is $43.84. We had used OpenAI and Anthropic to get the cost down to 12 cents \u2014 now we\u2019re doing it with DeepSeek on the back end, the cost per appeal is 2 cents.\"\n\nThe above findings suggest how DeepSeek may democratize artificial intelligence. However, its models are also raising concerns regarding data privacy, security, and potential for misuse. That said, while the impact DeepSeek's models have made is undeniable, it is a wait-and-watch moment to see whether it reshapes the AI world for the better or for worse.\n\nStory Continues",

View our editorial policy here.\n\nAccenture recently announced the launch of its new AI Refinery for Industry. The program will begin with a collection of 12 solutions to assist enterprises with rapidly building and deploying a network of AI agents to enhance the workforce, address industry-specific challenges, and drive business value faster.\n\nChannel Insider spoke with Sen Ramani, data and AI lead at Accenture, to discuss the refinery plans and how AI continues to shape significant plans for Accenture.\n\nAI\u2019s role in Accenture\u2019s 2025 business goals\n\nAccording to Ramani, the industry is entering into a new era of digitization and AI is continuously learning and driving new levels of autonomy for business.\n\n\u201cIn this context, Accenture is developing AI solutions that address industry-specific business goals and use cases,\u201d Ramani said. \u201cFor example, we have created agentic AI solutions that support revenue growth management for the consumer goods and services industry, improve personalization efforts for clinical trials in life sciences, assist with asset troubleshooting for industrial equipment, and improve workflow issues in the B2B marketing sector.\u201d\n\nRamani stated that by the end of 2025, Accenture will introduce 100 industry-specific agentic AI tools to engage clients across many different sectors. Further, Accenture will be working to bring AI out of the virtual realm and into the physical world.\n\nRecently, Accenture announced a collaboration with KION Group and NVIDIA to optimize supply chain performance.\n\n\u201cA major emphasis will be to reduce the time and costs associated with setting up and running warehouses,\u201d said Ramani. \u201cWe will do this by creating digital twins of facilities and by taking advantage of advanced robotic solutions. In applying AI to warehouse operations, we can reduce planning time, operating costs, and manual labor each by 50 percent.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Accenture sees GenAI positioned to be a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise, and it will continue to help clients build a data foundation necessary to capitalize on AI. Accenture\u2019s economic analysis finds that advances in AI and the technology sector will create just as much value in the next five years as it did in the previous 10. This indicates a broad-scale transformation across other industries.\n\n\u201cAs AI continuously evolves to continuously learn and act autonomously with and on behalf of people, the only limiting factor is trust. People\u2019s trust in AI is a measure of head and heart,\u201d said Ramani. \u201cIt is crucial that organizations bring employees along and empower people to shape how and where to use GenAI as part of continuous skills development. When done right, it ignites a virtuous learning loop: The more people use AI, the better it becomes, and the more they will want to use it. This positive reinforcement between people and AI is key to developing broader AI adoption across the enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe role of cybersecurity in AI\n\nAI needs a vast amount of of training data and requires trust across the inputs, systems, and employees involved. Cybersecurity\u2019s role in AI adoption and development is critical to getting the most out of the burgeoning technology.\n\n\u201cEvery enterprise has their own trust-building moments, technologies, AI strategies, and key relationships to focus on,\u201d said Ramani. \u201cBut broadly, any path forward will center on addressing trust across systems and data, AI itself, and people. The best advice is to ensure you have guardrails around your autonomous systems: Data security has long been critical to customer interactions but with the anticipated rising use of autonomous personified AI agents getting to know customers even more deeply, that security will be especially vital.\u201d\n\nRamani adds that before enterprises grant AI agents access to their information and permission to offer customer solutions, they must set detailed security rules with the technological infrastructure required to enforce them. They must define and continuously update AI explainability policies to customers and within their organization.\n\nOther areas of focus for Accenture\n\nBeyond AI, Accenture also has its sights set on other areas of the industry to ensure they\u2019re developing the best technologies and services to deliver to customers and to help partners grow. This will include investing a whopping $1 billion dedicated to training initiatives and partnerships over three years.\n\n\u201cThe pace of change in business will only continue to accelerate as new technologies embed themselves and expand across the marketplace,\u201d Ramani said. \u201cEmployee training, upskilling, and reskilling will be tremendously important for Accenture and for our clients in order to maintain course. We are investing $1 billion in training initiatives and partnerships over a three-year period. Helping clients find the right alignment between talent management, the introduction of new technologies and continuous rethinking of processes will be a key focus.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s new AI Refinery for Industry will power industry agent solutions to reduce the time to build and derive value from agents more quickly.

            "content": "Accenture follows Google in dismantling its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, reflecting a global shift as companies reassess their inclusion policies.\n\nGlobal consulting giant Accenture has announced a sweeping rollback of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, signaling a major shift in corporate policy. The move, confirmed by CEO Julie Sweet in an internal memo to employees, follows similar actions by Google and highlights growing scrutiny of workplace diversity initiatives worldwide.\n\nThe decision comes as DEI programs face increasing legal and political challenges, particularly in the U.S. While Accenture has framed the shift as an effort to refine its inclusion strategies, reports suggest compliance with regulatory changes may be a key driver\u2014especially given Accenture Federal Services' lucrative contracts with the U.S. government.\n\nSweet\u2019s memo outlined key changes, including the elimination of global diversity quotas, pausing submission to external DEI benchmarking surveys, and the discontinuation of career development programs designed for specific demographic groups.\n\nDespite these changes, Sweet insisted Accenture remains committed to fairness in the workplace.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be a meritocracy where every individual has an equal opportunity to thrive,\u201d she stated, emphasizing that inclusion remains a core company value.\n\nAccenture\u2019s rollback has ignited discussions about whether other multinational corporations will follow suit. While U.S. regulations are shifting, many regions\u2014including Europe and parts of Asia\u2014still maintain strong legal frameworks supporting DEI efforts. The extent to which Accenture\u2019s policy change will affect its global workforce remains unclear, with some analysts predicting regional adaptations based on local laws.\n\nThe broader implications of this decision extend beyond Accenture. Experts warn that as companies reassess their DEI programs, the move could set a precedent for scaling back diversity initiatives in industries where inclusion has been a central focus for years.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about one company\u2014this is part of a larger trend where businesses are reconsidering how they implement diversity initiatives in a changing legal and political landscape,\u201d said Sarah Liu, managing director of international DEI consultancy TDC Global.\n\nAccenture\u2019s decision follows Google\u2019s recent overhaul of its DEI policies, reflecting a growing corporate retreat from structured diversity efforts. However, not all companies are taking the same approach. Major firms such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citi are reviewing their policies, but some remain committed to their existing inclusion frameworks.\n\nMeanwhile, organizations in regions with strong DEI commitments\u2014such as the European Union\u2014have indicated they will maintain their diversity targets despite shifting attitudes in the U.S.\n\nAs companies navigate political and legal complexities, the future of DEI in the corporate world remains uncertain. Some experts suggest that while formal quotas and structured DEI programs may be scaled back, companies will integrate diversity efforts under broader frameworks such as \"workplace culture\" and \"employee experience\" to maintain inclusivity without regulatory risks.\n\nFor now, Accenture\u2019s policy shift marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of corporate DEI strategies. Whether this signals the beginning of a widespread retreat from workplace diversity initiatives\u2014or merely a recalibration\u2014remains to be seen.",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this consulting company have returned +11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which Accenture belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAccenture is expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.73 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.73 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Accenture is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Accenture.\n\nStory Continues",

Gurjot Ahluwalia, a senior manager at Accenture Strategy, shared his \u2018biggest achievement in 2024\u2019, which was reaching a net worth of \u20b95 crore in eleven years.\n\nWhile sharing the update on his personal finance journey, Ahluwalia also revealed that he aims to become financially independent in 2025. According to the screenshot of his net worth assets, his total investment is estimated to grow to \u20b913.1 crore by 2035.\n\nAlso Read | Nora Fatehi becomes victim of fake death news; video goes viral\n\nWhat is the secret to financial freedom? Gurugram-based Gurjot Ahluwalia also mentioned the key factors that helped him grow his investments. As he remained focused on building his net worth over the years, he made sure to never distract from three key elements: \u201cProfessional growth, aggressive savings, and equity investments.\u201d\n\nGurjot Ahluwalia shared secret to financial freedom.\n\nWhile professional growth helped him earn better, prioritising savings of gratifications helped him invest more in options like equities.\n\nAhluwalia also referred to the stock market corrections in the past two months and added that his net worth has reduced by 8-10 per cent. Still, he is sure the next bull market will help him \u2018fulfil all his materialistic aspirations\u2019.\n\nHe also mentioned that he always attempted to keep his debt low. Since his parents covered his education and he was still living with his family, he was never required to spend money on rent and education.\n\n\u2018Liabilities below \u20b9 1 lakh\u2019 Replying to one of the queries in the comments section, Gurjot Ahluwalia mentioned that he generally prefers to keep \u2018liabilities below \u20b91 lakh\u2019.",

            "content": "Investors in Accenture plc (Symbol: ACN) saw new options become available today, for the April 17th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 70 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ACN options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $390.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $390.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $377.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ACN, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $394.39/share today.\n\nBecause the $390.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.28% return on the cash commitment, or 17.12% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Accenture plc, and highlighting in green where the $390.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $405.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of ACN stock at the current price level of $394.39/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $405.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.24% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ACN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Accenture plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ACN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $405.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $405.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.55% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 26%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $394.39) to be 25%.

Mr Ahluwalia, who aims to be financially independent in 2025, shared his milestone on social media, calling it his biggest achievement of 2024. He also posted a screenshot of his financial tracking app, displaying a net worth of Rs 5 crore against liabilities of only Rs 2.7 lakh.\n\nMr Ahluwalia credits his success to a three-pronged approach: career advancement for increased earnings, disciplined saving through delayed gratification, and strategic equity investments, which he says were instrumental in reaching his Rs 5 crore net worth in just 11 years.\n\nHe noted that his transition from a salaried middle-class individual to a net worth of Rs 5 crore was largely due to two key factors: having no debt (as his parents funded his education) and not paying rent (since he lived with his parents). He also acknowledged that recent market corrections had led to an 8-10% decline in his net worth. The Indian equity market benchmark index, Nifty, has fallen over 10% from last year's highs, with even steeper corrections in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.\n\nHitting this milestone was my biggest achievement in 2024.\n\n\n\nA salaried middle class person like me went from 0 to \u20b95,00,00,000 in 11 years.\n\n\n\n3 Key Elements\n\n\n\n1.

If a world has a higher proportion of rocky material (like iron and silicon) compared to ices, this means it formed in a zone of the developing solar system, called a \"protoplanetary disk,\" where it was too hot for many ices to form.\n\nBut this observation contradicts what planetary scientists thought about how gaseous giants like WASP-121b spawned in their expansive, donut-shaped protoplanetary disk. The leading theory was these giant worlds were created in the outer part of these disks, where it's frigid, but there are copious amounts of gas available to amass onto a developing world.\n\n\"Our measurement means that perhaps this typical view needs to be reconsidered and our planet formation models revisited,\" Peter Smith, an astrophysicist at Arizona State University\u2019s School Of Earth and Space Exploration and coauthor of the research, said in a statement.

Paredes\n\nThe researchers used the powerful Gemini South telescope, located at 8,980 feet in the Chilean mountains, to peer into the atmosphere of distant WASP-121b, located some 880 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy. Attached to the telescope was an instrument called the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer, or IGRINS, which separates out the light observed from distant space objects, like a prism. The different light spectrums reveal the atmospheric composition of these distant worlds.\n\nPeering into WASP-121b also revealed more about the intensity of this alien realm. \"The climate of this planet is extreme, and nothing like that of Earth,\u201d Smith explained.\n\n\"The climate of this planet is extreme, and nothing like that of Earth.\"\n\nThe planet is tidally locked to its star \u2014 like the moon is locked to Earth \u2014 meaning that one side of WASP-121b is incessantly seared by its star, while the other is dark and (relatively) cooler. On the dayside, elements like calcium are vaporized into the air. But on the nightside, these materials can condense and produce rain. The astronomers, for example, spotted \"calcium rain\" on WASP-121b.\n\nThere are no \"hot Jupiters\" like WASP-121b in our solar system. Nor are there any rocky super-Earth worlds. Yet exoplanet researchers have found both these planet types are common in our galaxy. Although there are some strange-sounding worlds out there, it may be that it's our cosmic neighborhood that's actually quite unusual. And not just that. Our solar system may host an extraordinarily rare galactic phenomena: an intelligent, communicating civilization.",

Additionally, they will get mentorship and soft skills training through employee engagement activities. Marriott International will then offer paid internships to eligible candidates from the training program across its 155 properties in India for the remaining two months. By fostering an inclusive environment, Marriott International and Accenture in India aim to create pathways to better job prospects, bridging the gap between untapped talent and employment opportunities in the dynamic hospitality sector.\n\nIn a world where securing a job is a cornerstone for stability and growth, having the right skillset can make all the difference in achieving one\u2019s dream career. However, not everyone can pursue higher education and additional skill-building that can enhance their professional prospects. Recognising this gap, Marriott International and Accenture in India are focusing on skill development in key areas. This collaborative project is designed to prepare participants for entry-level jobs in the industry and will give young individuals a chance to gain hands-on experience while earning a livelihood.\n\nTalking about this new initiative, Ranju Alex, Area Vice President \u2013 South Asia, Marriott International, says: \u201cThe core values of this organisation are deeply rooted in the belief that everyone deserves equal opportunities. Unfortunately, barriers often prevent many talented individuals from pursuing their aspirations. To address this, we are proud to offer a two-month paid internship programme following the completion of the skill development process. This initiative not only provides young talent with hands-on experience but also ensures financial support for every participant, empowering them to take confident steps towards building rewarding careers in the hospitality sector. By investing in their growth, we aim to cultivate a more inclusive and skilled workforce.\u201d\n\nAjay Vij, Senior Country Managing Director at Accenture in India commented, \u201cWe are excited to collaborate with Marriott International on this project. The initiative furthers our objective of creating impact at scale and reflects our commitment to providing our youth with the resources and opportunities needed to be employment ready in today\u2019s competitive environment. We are not only investing in their future but also investing in building a sustainable future for the communities we live and operate in.\u201d\n\nThe project is dedicated to empowering the next generation by breaking down economic and social barriers that hinder professional growth. Together, both brands aspire to spark a larger movement towards impactful corporate social responsibility, setting a benchmark for industry-wide initiatives.",

Accenture AI Refinery is built on NVIDIA AI Foundry, laying the ground for this month's partnership.\n\nLan Guan, Accenture's chief AI officer, said, \u201cMany businesses have not seen the full benefits of generative AI yet. In fact, only 10% of the companies have fully scaled generative AI,\u201d Among their challenges are adoption cost, complexity, data, and talent readiness.\n\nFrom Generative to Agentic AI\n\nIn the advanced press briefing, Accenture and NVIDIA executives revealed Accenture is looking beyond generative AI, and preparing for Agentic AI. \u201cTo me, it's no longer about [humans] prompting the LLMs, but ... AI agents that have self-reflecting capabilities,\u201d said Guan. \u201cI believe this is the future we are heading towards\u2014AIs that not just respond but also learn, improve, and work as part of the team. It will change the way we think about productivity.\u201d\n\nIn Accenture AI Refinery's hierarchical infrastructure, AI utility agents are overseen by super agents, with orchestrator agents at the top.\n\nThe Accenture NVIDIA AI Business Group is aiming to serve those who need marketing reinvention, supply chain reinvention, software-defined factories, healthcare, and immersive consumer experiences, among others. The newly launched business group is expected to help clients lay the foundation for agentic AI functionality, to advance areas such as process reinvention, AI-powered simulation, and sovereign AI (managing cities and governments using AI).\n\nTo test and prove the efficiency of its own offering, Accenture announced its \u201cmarketing function is integrating the AI Refinery platform with autonomous agents to help create and run smarter campaigns faster. This will result in a 25-35% reduction in manual steps, 6% cost savings and is expected to achieve a 25-55% increase in speed to market.\u201d\n\nNIMs as the Cornerstones of Accenture AI Offerings\n\nLan Guan clarified that the 30,000 professionals in the group are part of Accenture's global data and AI team. \u201cThey've all been trained with NVIDIA technology. They are fully deployed to this initiative, but they will also be working on other ecosystem technologies to take our AI Refinery capabilities to more organizations,\u201d she added.\n\nJustin Boitano, NVIDIA's VP of Enterprise AI, said, \u201cNVIDIA NIMs [NVIDIA Inferencing Microservices] are a core part of this initiative. They deliver two to five times better token efficiency when running on our GPUs. You'll have NIMs that read structured data, as well as unstructured data, and NIMs that read domain-specific LLMs.\u201d",

            "content": "How do you think that leaders can promote inclusivity in your teams?\n\nAinur\n\nIf we want to encourage inclusivity, we should start with ourselves.\n\nRole modelling is the first step to ensure that people will follow us. Then the most important thing is to remember that it's not only behavioral change, it's a mindset change. It might take more than a year because usually business leaders are very fast. They want miracles to happen immediately, and when they don't see the results immediately they tend to give up with the pursuit of diversity.\n\nSo first I would say start from yourself. Have the principles be a role model, show it and people definitely see it and they will follow. Have patience.\n\nJavier\n\nLead by example is important to start with because the actions of the leader sets the tone for group behavior. Demonstrating a commitment to diversity and inclusion, showing interest in different perspectives and giving visibility to everyone's achievements \u2014 all these things together communicate to teams that diverse backgrounds and different points of view are not just not only accepted, but they are also valued.\n\nFurthermore, I would say that another action that can be added to that is fostering the exchange \u2014 integrating perspectives from different contexts and backgrounds and reaching that decision making.\n\nThis is particularly valuable in the sustainability landscape where the environmental and social challenges require a creative approach.\n\nHaving an active listening channel for people to give feedback and take action based on feedback \u2014 that's very important as well to me, as part of the inclusive leadership.\n\nWhen all these strategies are put into practice they help not just to build teams that reflect the values of equity and respect, but I think they also improve the ability of the project to generate a positive impact.\n\nJavette\n\nWhen you're talking about leadership, that also leads to the culture and the opportunity to listen and understand different perspectives. Internally, who are the decision makers, who are the stakeholders with whom you're going to engage?\n\nThen externally, as Peter mentioned, we engage with suppliers to bring them up to speed to ensure that they understand our processes and what we're inviting them to participate in. Inclusivity, though, does really require a dialogue discussion and a willingness to listen and engage. I think some of that does have to come with education, training and awareness sessions, too.\n\nPeter\n\nIt's also important that we engage people and stakeholders into making policies and strategies. I come across a lot of organisations where they demonstrate their commitment online and say their CEO is committed to supplier diversity and they are having a spend target of so many percentages.\n\nBut then stakeholders say they weren\u2019t part of that decision so have different insights and cannot make those commitments. If you make them part of it, make sure that they are part of the discussion and deliver input, then you have a very informed target that you're developing and you get people much more engaged. They are part of the solution and I think that's very important.\n\nYou need to be very transparent about what you are trying to achieve, making sure that you communicate that it's part of your business and for your company strategy overall \u2014 but also you see ambitions.\n\nYou always want to make sure that you communicate very well that supplier diversity is part of ESG because it tackles the ethical social aspects. We really want to make sure that people understand that and they see that relationship, plus the relationship with the work that they do day-to-day, because then it becomes much more exciting for them to be participating.\n\nTo read the full story in the magazine, click HERE.\n\n\n\nExplore the latest edition of Sustainability Magazine and be part of the conversation at our global conference series, Sustainability LIVE.\n\nDiscover all our upcoming events and secure your tickets today.\n\nSustainability Magazine is a BizClik brand \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n",

This new addition will offer a suite of services including application development, IT service management, and management of business functions such as HR, finance, and marketing.\n\nAccenture's Ballarat hub is expected to create a variety of new job opportunities while providing local residents with the chance to develop increasingly sought-after technology skills. In a bid to nurture a future-ready workforce, the facility will collaborate with Federation University to provide students with hands-on experience and training through the university's Co-operative Education Model.\n\nThe initiative comes at a time when there is increasing emphasis on the need for onshore technology support in both the public and private sectors, especially where keeping data within the nation's borders is of paramount interest.\n\nMatt Coates, Technology Lead for Accenture in Australia and New Zealand, commented on the development: \"We are excited to be establishing a tech centre in the thriving city of Ballarat. Increasingly our clients in both the private and public sectors are looking for technology and operations support to be delivered right here in Australia, particularly in cases where it is in the nation's interest for data to remain onshore.\"\n\nCoates added, \"This new facility will expand our existing local delivery capability and help us meet this growing need for sovereign technology services, delivered onshore. At the same time, it will create a new range of employment opportunities in Ballarat and help local residents develop technology skills that will be in high demand in the future.\"\n\nHe further noted, \"Our research for the Tech Council of Australia has shown that the nation faces a shortfall of workers with technical skills. We are confident that this development in Ballarat will be a powerful example of how businesses can work together with the education sector and local communities to begin to address the gap and create a future-ready local workforce for the nation.\"\n\nThe Mayor of Ballarat, Cr Tracey Hargreaves, expressed delight at the plans: \"We are thrilled that a global organisation like Accenture has recognised the potential held in the Ballarat region. The investment they are making in this technology hub will create jobs and upskilling opportunities for our workforce, help strengthen our local economy and create a more sustainable future for the region.\"\n\nMayor Hargreaves also stated, \"It will also allow our people to work on projects of national importance, which I'm sure will be a drawcard for many to relocate to the area.\"\n\nProfessor Duncan Bentley, Vice Chancellor and President of Federation University Australia, welcomed the collaboration: \"Federation University is delighted to welcome Accenture to our Technology Park located in Ballarat and supporting the establishment of their new tech hub. This partnership with Accenture is yet another great reason why studying IT and business-related courses at Federation University is a great career move.\"\n\nProfessor Bentley highlighted the benefits for students, \"As through our Co-operative Education Model students will have the opportunity to undertake paid placements, career preparation and workplace skill development with one of the world's leading professional services providers.\"",

Additionally, 11 consulting networks are included.\n\n\n\nAsked what the most likely growth area for work would be in the next three years, the majority of consultants (67 per cent) said artificial intelligence.

The surveys were conducted online by Statista.\n\nPeer survey\n\nBuilding on last year\u2019s methodology, a longlist of more than 1,700 firms was used as a basis for the latest survey among peers. To update the longlist, Statista used recommendations from previous years and these sources: lists from associations (eg Management Consultancies Association); consulting directories (eg Consultingcase101); and company databases.\n\nThe list of consulting partners and executives was compiled using research conducted mainly on firms\u2019 websites. It was also possible to register for the survey on ft.com. The sample included more than 4,000 partners and executives of UK firms.\n\nInvitations to the survey were sent via email containing a personalised link. This took place from June 17 to August 16, 2024.\n\nPartners and executives could make recommendations in 16 sectors and for 15 consulting services, and could recommend consulting networks. Respondents were also able to name consultancies or networks they would refrain from recommending.\n\nAn autocomplete function was available to assist in selecting a consultancy or network and respondents could recommend any consultancy that did not appear in the autocomplete list, or add a negative evaluation. A score was given to each firm based on the number of positive and negative recommendations they received. Self-recommendations were excluded.\n\nClient surveys\n\nTwo online surveys were then conducted among about 2,000 senior executives who have used management consultancies in the past four years. They either registered themselves for the surveys on ft.com between June 17 and August 16, 2024, or were recruited through an online access panel from August 26 to September 13, 2024.\n\nRespondents were asked to indicate the sectors or consulting services in which they had collaborated with a management consultancy in the past four years. They were then asked to recommend firms by using autofill or adding names. For each sector or consulting service they specified, the respondents were given a list of recommended consultancies for evaluation.\n\nIn the survey of clients recruited through the online access panel, the quality of the firms and networks was scored using a five-point scale (very good to very poor). The evaluations \u201cvery good\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d counted as recommendations (\u201cvery good\u201d counted as one recommendation, \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cacceptable\u201d carried a lower weight). The evaluations \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvery poor\u201d counted against consultancies and networks. Reputation is typically built over several years and this list aims to reflect that longevity. Therefore, last year\u2019s results were taken into account, attributed a low weighting.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn each sector and consulting service, firms were sorted according to the number of recommendations (taking into account a reduction for negative evaluations).\n\nThe groups were placed in the classes below, based on the average number of recommendations in that sector or service:\n\n\u2022 The top 10 per cent of consulting firms (based on the total number of recommendations) among all awarded companies in each sector and service area received a gold rating.\n\n\u2022 Consulting firms outside the top 10 per cent, but still within the top 40 per cent (based on the total number of recommendations) among all awarded companies in each sector and service area, received a silver rating.\n\n\u2022 Consulting firms outside the top 40 per cent, which received at least the average number of recommendations of all companies with at least one recommendation, received a bronze rating.\n\n\u2022 Those with insufficient recommendations were excluded. Consultancies are sorted alphabetically in each class.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe ranking comprises firms with a sufficient number of recommendations; a mention is positive and is a vote of confidence from the market. The ranking was created through a complex process. The quality of consultancies not included is not disputed.",

            "content": "In the summer of 2020, the US was in the throes of the COVID pandemic. Workers across the country and the socioeconomic spectrum had been laid off, been furloughed, or had their hours reduced. Millions of workers, including independent workers, were turning to government assistance to make ends meet. The COVID crisis brought into sharp focus the need for everyone, regardless of their employment status, to be able to find good-quality, rewarding work, to work in the way they choose, and to have access to an adequate social safety net.\n\nAt the time, public discourse on platform work in the US was focused on workers\u2019 classification. In a country where key elements of the social safety net are provided by employers to their employees, reclassifying platform workers as employees was seen as an expedient pathway to their protection. California had passed a bill seeking to reclassify gig workers, and other states were considering similar measures.\n\nIt was in this context that we published our Working Together Priorities, a set of priorities for industry and government action that we hoped would improve the quality of independent work for the millions of people who work with platforms like Uber while preserving the control and autonomy that we know these workers value. We hoped that getting specific about the steps we could take as companies and the steps we need to take in partnership with workers and government would encourage a more constructive discussion on the future of independent platform work and protect access to flexible, secure work at precisely the moment when both flexibility and security were needed.\n\nNearly 5 years on, platform work has played an important role in America\u2019s economic recovery. Some of the workers hardest hit by the pandemic were women, young people, and new immigrants. Many turned to platform work: 57% of new platform workers surveyed by Accenture in 2021 had either lost a job or had their hours reduced, and nearly 80% reported that platform work acted as a financial safety net during the crisis. Of app-based workers surveyed, 85% have said their work with platforms has been helpful in dealing with inflation. In 2022, over 7 million Americans worked with the major app-based rideshare and delivery platforms, which contributed an estimated $212 billion to the US economy.\n\nPeople turned to platforms during these challenging economic times because it\u2019s easy to get started and possible to fit the work around your life. Drivers and couriers who earn with Uber have real-time control over their working hours, times, and locations\u2014there are no shifts and no minimum hours. There\u2019s no obligation to work, and workers can and do work across multiple and competing apps. This kind of flexibility just doesn\u2019t exist in traditional employment.\n\nDuring this time, voters in California passed Proposition 22, which clarified app-based workers\u2019 status and introduced new benefits, including minimum earnings, healthcare stipends, and occupational accident insurance. Prop 22 was challenged and ultimately upheld by the California Supreme Court. The overwhelming majority of app-based drivers in California say that Prop 22 has been good for them and recommend that other states pass laws like Prop 22. We partnered with industry and labor in Washington State to support a bill regulating rideshare, including minimum earnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers\u2019 compensation coverage for drivers. We\u2019ve reached agreements with the Attorneys General in New York and Massachusetts that introduce new protections for rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits. States have passed or are considering bills enabling or mandating benefits for gig workers. No state has reclassified gig workers as employees of platforms.\n\nThis document provides an update on our corporate commitments and the calls to action we set out in 2020. This progress and emerging consensus are the product of meaningful dialogue with workers and their representatives, government, other platforms, and experts. There is more work to do, and we remain committed to doing it.",

            "content": "Shares of Accenture (ACN -5.35%) have quietly surged toward their 52-week high at the start of 2025. The consulting juggernaut is delivering solid operational and financial momentum, emerging as a surprising leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling clients to implement cutting-edge technology solutions.\n\nWith these encouraging developments, investors might wonder whether its stock price rally still has room to run, or if the opportunity for profit has already passed.\n\nLet's consider what to do with Accenture stock from here.\n\nThe case to buy or hold Accenture stock\n\nWith a talent pool of 799,000 employees in more than 120 countries, Accenture stands out as a global leader in professional services. Beyond its roots in management advisory and operations outsourcing, the company has evolved by helping major organizations navigate increasingly complex digital transformation needs. Strategies and solutions in areas like cloud computing, data analytics, cybersecurity, automation, and AI are in high demand and represent major growth drivers.\n\nThe impact has been impressive. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended Nov. 30), revenue climbed by 9% year over year, with strength across regions and industry groups. Earnings per share (EPS) surged by 16%, reflecting the ongoing shift toward more high-tech and value-added offerings that contribute to higher margins.\n\nAI has become a central part of the business, with clients seeking to integrate capabilities like generative AI into their existing systems, as well as a tool to enhance their own productivity and consulting efficiency.\n\nThe pace of new bookings was strong enough for management to hike its full-year guidance. Accenture now projects 2025 revenue growth of between 4% and 7%, accelerating from its 1% increase last year. The midpoint of management's EPS guidance range of $12.43 to $12.79 would be an 11% increase from 2024's result of $11.44.\n\nSimilarly, free cash flow is expected to leap higher this year, which likely played a role in the company's decision to increase its dividend by 15% to a new quarterly rate of $1.48 per share. The dividend yield at the current share price is a modest 1.5%, but those payouts add to the attraction of the stock.\n\nUltimately, investors who are confident in Accenture's ability to continue capitalizing on its growth potential have plenty of reasons to buy and hold the stock today.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 Estimate Revenue growth (YOY) 1% 4% to 7% EPS $11.44 $12.43 to $12.79 EPS growth (YOY) 6% 9% to 12% Free cash flow $8.6 billion $8.8 billion to $9.5 billion\n\nThe case to sell Accenture stock\n\nAccenture's recent results speak for themselves, and 2025 is poised to be a big year for the company. That being said, the stock market is unpredictable in the short run, so it's critical for investors to examine investments closely and think carefully about what could go wrong.\n\nA key risk for Accenture is its exposure to the global macroeconomic environment. Resilient conditions have been a tailwind driving client demand from businesses seeking to expand. However, there signs of a deteriorating outlook -- geopolitical conflicts and rising international trade barriers could translate into a slowdown for the consulting sector. That would be a headwind for the stock.\n\nAnother reason that caution may be warranted is that the market for IT services and digital transformation projects remains highly competitive. Accenture's traditional peer group includes consulting firms like Cognizant Technologies and Infosys, but it must also compete with major tech players like International Business Machines, Microsoft, and Oracle -- all of which offer similar AI implementation solutions.\n\nInvestors should also consider Accenture's premium valuation: It trades today at about 30 times its consensus 2025 EPS. That forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is in the upper end of the range for its peer group. That isn't necessarily a sign that the stock is due for a sell-off, but it could limit its near-term upside.\n\nInvestors who doubt Accenture's ability to hit its earnings guidance or who believe it's at peak growth might consider moving on from the stock now.\n\nDecision time: I'm bullish on Accenture\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons of Accenture stock, I'm bullish, and believe it could make a compelling addition to a diversified portfolio. Strong quarterly results in 2025 could provide catalysts for stock price gains over the next year. The company's enterprise-level brand recognition, its solid fundamentals, and its proven adaptability to the evolving needs of its clients position it well to continue rewarding shareholders.",

The case concerned two different types of transactions:\n\nTransaction 1 \u2013 Secondment of staff\n\nThe group's operating companies may provide services to customers by exploiting internal resources from other group entities through an International Assignment Agreement (\u201cIAA\u201d). Under the IAA, a cross-border resource can be sourced by a \u201cHost-entity\u201d (e.g. Accenture A/S) to perform temporary assignments whereafter the resource returns to its \u201cHome-entity\u201d where the member of staff is employed. According to the IAA, amounts payable by Host-entity to the Home-entity are to be determined based on the reimbursement of payroll costs and payroll, adding a markup of 30% (i.e., gross-margin) based on a consultancy services benchmarking study.\n\nTransaction 2 \u2013 Royalty\n\nIn 2006, Accenture A/S entered into a licensing agreement with the Swiss group company Accenture Global Services GmbH (AGS). According to the licensing agreement, AGS owns a number of intangible assets, and Accenture A/S pays a royalty of 7% of its revenue from external customers for the use of these assets.\n\n\n\nThe High Court previously ruled in favour of the Danish tax authorities (DTA), finding Accenture's documentation insufficient due to inaccurate delineation of transactions and inadequate financial data segmentation. Consequently, with the burden of proof shifted and Accenture failing to demonstrate errors in the discretionary assessment, the DTA's assessment was upheld.\n\nThe Supreme Court Ruling\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the DTA did not demonstrate that Accenture's transfer pricing documentation for the income years 2005-2011 regarding the 30% markup, and the royalty rate of 7% was insufficient thus ruling the opposite of the Eastern High Court. The Supreme Court stressed that the transfer pricing documentation adhered to the principles of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and further emphasized that due consideration had been carried out concerning the choice of transfer pricing methods concerning each transaction (the cost-plus method and the residual profit split respectively), a functional and risk analysis, and a comparability analysis supported by sufficient underlying data.\n\nImportant takeaways:",

Ballarat is a great growth story and an opportunity for folks that are living in the region to get involved with this global shift.\u201d\n\nAccenture\u2019s new office \u2013 which will be based in Federation University\u2019s Ballarat Technology Park alongside EY\u2019s hub \u2013 will kick off operations from May with more than 100 staff in place, including some potential tree-changers from the firm\u2019s Melbourne city office. Thereafter, Accenture will look to ramp up its numbers through local skills training in conjunction with Federation.\n\nAccording to the report, the hub will support Accenture\u2019s public and private sector clients with managed services in areas such as finance, human resources and marketing, along with application development and other IT services leveraging advanced technologies including Gen AI. As it stands, Accenture has offices in every mainland state and territory capital bar Darwin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing the same sort of work in Ballarat that we do across Australia and New Zealand,\u201d Coates told The Australian. \u201cThe uniqueness here is we\u2019re tapping into another source of talent that we haven\u2019t done previously. We want to have a little bit more of an anchor around some of the longer-term managed services that our clients are looking for out of the Ballarat centre.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the new hub follows in the wake of Accenture\u2019s recently-announced seven-year joint venture with Telstra, which will see the telco invest $700 million on rolling out AI across its operations in a bid to improve efficiency and customer experience. Comprising experts from both organisations, the new entity will be tasked with building specialised AI tools to support the endeavour.",

            "content": "AI announcements have become almost daily occurrences, yet Telstra\u2019s recent joint venture with Accenture stands out as particularly noteworthy. This partnership signals a significant shift in how large enterprises are approaching AI adoption to create an AI advantage. Telstra understands that the only path to sustainable business advantage using AI lies in capturing and putting its organization\u2019s unique and proprietary knowledge, expertise, and capabilities to work through AI models, apps, and agents.\n\nFrom copilots to agentic workflows\n\nWhat\u2019s the main purpose of this announcement? Telstra\u2019s approach represents a fundamental departure from a more piecemeal AI implementation strategy. Rather than simply automating isolated tasks along existing business processes, the company aims to embrace agentic workflows to reinvent business processes. This isn\u2019t just about making existing processes faster or more efficient; it\u2019s about reimagining how work gets done in the first place.\n\nThe telecommunications giant understands that creating an AI advantage requires more than just sprinkling AI capabilities across various departments. It demands a ground-up rethinking of how tasks are accomplished, putting Telstra\u2019s proprietary knowledge to work but with AI serving as a collaborative partner rather than a mere tool. This approach bridges what Forrester calls the \u201cprocess chasm\u201d \u2014 the gap between a focus on productivity optimization and genuine business reinvention.\n\nWhere\u2019s the ROI?\n\nTwo years into the generative AI era, most enterprises are struggling to deliver meaningful returns on their AI investments. Telstra\u2019s approach is different: Rather than treating AI as a cost center, it is building a revenue-generating platform. By developing and refining AI solutions through internal implementation first, Telstra positions itself to offer battle-tested, industry-specific AI capabilities to clients globally.\n\nThe strategy is clever: Leverage deep telecommunications expertise to create unique AI solutions for process optimization and customer experience enhancement. This \u201cbuild, then sell\u201d approach amortizes the initial AI investment across a broader revenue base while creating new revenue streams to justify the substantial up-front costs. By combining its domain expertise with Accenture\u2019s global delivery capabilities, Telstra is creating scalable enterprise AI solutions.\n\nNavigating the expertise gap\n\nThis joint venture is also about securing access to increasingly scarce AI talent and expertise. Telstra is consolidating its AI partnerships down to just two primary relationships, including the Accenture joint venture. Talent and co-innovation partnerships are what it takes to succeed in the AI era. The global demand for AI specialists far outstrips supply, and Telstra\u2019s strategic partnership ensures that it has priority access to the specialized skills needed to execute its ambitious vision, including deep expertise in business processes and domains.\n\nDriving adoption through empowerment\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing aspect of Telstra\u2019s strategy is its commitment to developing \u201cdata and AI fluency\u201d across the workforce. This approach recognizes that the greatest productivity gains come not from automation alone but from empowering employees and customers to work differently. This internal transformation raises important questions about workforce dynamics, however. The joint venture\u2019s stated goal of becoming \u201cmore efficient and streamlined\u201d over time could potentially create tension with labor unions. The success of this initiative will likely depend on how well Telstra manages this transition, balancing efficiency gains with workforce concerns.\n\nAI FOMO: Strategic imperative or market pressure?\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to view Telstra\u2019s moves through the lens of \u201cAI FOMO,\u201d the structured and comprehensive nature of its approach suggests something more strategic at play. Yes, market pressures and competitive dynamics certainly influence the timing of such announcements, but the depth of Telstra\u2019s commitment \u2014 evidenced by the joint venture structure, focus on workforce development, and holistic implementation approach \u2014 indicates a well-thought-out strategy rather than a reactive response to market trends.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAs this partnership unfolds, several key questions emerge: How will Telstra measure success beyond traditional metrics? Can a telco successfully transition to an enterprise AI solutions provider? Can it achieve the sales velocity needed to justify the investment? How will it balance the drive for efficiency with workforce transformation? And perhaps most importantly, will this comprehensive approach to AI integration serve as a model for other enterprises?\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Telstra\u2019s initiative represents more than just another AI partnership announcement. It signals a maturing approach to AI adoption, one that recognizes the need for deep expertise, a focus on delivering business value, workforce development, and systematic transformation leading to business reinvention. Whether we\u2019ve reached \u201cpeak AI FOMO\u201d may be debatable, but what\u2019s certain is that we\u2019re entering a new phase of AI implementation \u2014 one that demands more thoughtful, comprehensive approaches to business transformation.\n\nThe original article is here.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CDOTrends.

Investing in infrastructure would be greatly beneficial.\u201d\n\nThe Zinnov-Nasscom India GCC Landscape report shows a rise in tier-2 and tier-3 city GCCs, increasing from 5% in FY2019 to 7% in FY2024. These Nano GCCs are expected to grow by 15-20% by 2025, with 25-30% growth projected in the following years.\n\nAccording to AIM Research, cities like Chandigarh and Indore, each housing 4% of total GCCs, are becoming new hotspots for expansion. While Bengaluru and Hyderabad are still leading, many companies are exploring alternative locations to tap into skilled graduates from smaller cities.\n\nWith tier-2 cities home to many engineering, IT, and business institutions, experts believe this shift will help GCCs find the right talent while spreading economic benefits across more regions.\n\nIn a major push for education and skill development, the finance minister announced a CoE in Artificial Intelligence for Education with a total outlay of INR 500 crore. This initiative builds on the three AI centres set up in 2023 for agriculture, healthcare, and sustainable cities.\n\nSitharaman also revealed plans for five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling, designed to equip the youth with industry-relevant expertise. \u201cThese centres will be set up with global partnerships to support Make for India and Make for the World manufacturing,\u201d Sitharaman stated.\n\nThe initiative will cover curriculum design, trainer training, a skill certification framework, and regular assessments.\n\nTo strengthen higher education, the government is investing in the expansion of IIT infrastructure. Over the past decade, student intake at IITs has doubled from 65,000 to 1.35 lakh.\n\nAdditional facilities will be developed at five IITs established post-2014, creating space for 6,500 more students.

Various sectors expressed their approval of the provisions aimed at boosting growth, encouraging investment, and providing relief to the middle class.Here's what top executives of Microsoft, Tata Technologies, Accenture, Noise and others have to say on Union Budget 2025:\"We welcome the government's focus on AI skilling in the Union Budget 2025 and are encouraged by our shared vision of making India AI first. The proposed Centre of Excellence (CoE) for AI in Education is a forward-thinking initiative towards empowering our workforce. Microsoft recently announced successful skilling of 2 million people across India in AI under our ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative. We further committed to train 10 million more people in AI by 2030. We will also establish \u2018AI Productivity Labs\u2019 in 20 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs)/NIELIT centers in 10 states to impart foundational courses for 20,000 educators. With these investments, we are not only enhancing India\u2019s competitive edge but also ensuring sustainable growth and innovation. This Budget reflects a commitment to building a technologically advanced and inclusive economy, and we are excited to support India lead in an AI-centric world.\u201dThe Finance Minister\u2019s announcements reflect a clear intent to harness the potential of the travel and tourism sector by prioritizing infrastructure, improving access, incentivizing investment, and expanding its reach beyond established hubs. Strengthening regional connectivity through the modified UDAN scheme will unlock new corridors of travel, bringing deeper parts of India into the tourism fold. The 50-year interest-free loan to state governments will drive infrastructure development at the destination level, thereby contributing to the tourism growth story. The challenge-mode approach to developing 50 destinations, backed by performance-linked incentives, shifts the focus to outcome-driven execution \u2014 encouraging states to compete and innovate in destination management.Equally important is the structured push for hospitality. Including hotels in the harmonized infrastructure list across 50 destinations will unlock long-term financing and drive investment, while extending Mudra loans to homestays ensures that smaller entrepreneurs and local communities are equally part of this growth story.\u201cThe budget's focus on establishing a National Manufacturing Mission aligns with our goal of engineering in India for 'Make in India' and enhancing the nation's self-reliance in manufacturing. This initiative is poised to attract investments and improve efficiency, positioning Indian companies as globally competitive players. The establishment of five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling is a pivotal move in building a future-ready workforce. This initiative resonates with our commitment to engineering a better future for India's youth through investment in in-demand training programs across Industry 4.0, IoT, and advanced manufacturing, and collaborating with state governments to upgrade ITIs into technology hubs. Additionally, the allocation of \u20b9500 crore for a Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for education underscores the importance of fostering innovation and research in AI, which will benefit both the education sector and the broader technology landscape.\u201d\u201cThe Budget's forward-looking focus on deep-tech innovations like AI, global capability centres (GCCs), and future-ready talent underscores a strong commitment towards \u201cViksit Bharat.\u201d The other initiatives like Deeptech Fund of Funds and 10,000 fellowships for tech research, 5 National CoEs and a CoE for AI in Education, reiterate our commitment to developing an ecosystem for next-gen tech. The opening up of new avenues for GCCs in tier-2 cities will help states bolster their infra, bridge skill gaps and aid talent growth.\u201d\u201cWith India\u2019s economy being the fastest growing among major global economies, the Union Budget rightly allocates additional resources to drive innovation and technological advancement. The emphasis on skilling, new reforms to enhance the ease of doing business, and the establishment of a Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence can serve as key drivers of India\u2019s growth. The announcement of a Deep Tech fund can encourage startups from both technical and non-technical backgrounds to make a substantial contribution to the economy. Additionally, a new manufacturing mission under the Make in India initiative will strengthen MSMEs, which play a vital role in positioning India as a global manufacturing hub and generating employment for our youth.\u201d\"The Union Budget 2025, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , sets a bold roadmap for India's manufacturing growth with its visionary push for 'Make in India' and skill development. It is encouraging to see the government taking strategic steps to support the consumer electronics industry, particularly through the reduction in import duties on key components. This will lower production costs, boost local manufacturing, and enhance affordability, marking a significant step towards strengthening India's position as a global hub for innovation. Additionally, the launch of the National Manufacturing Mission will empower domestic industries\u2014small, medium, and large\u2014to innovate and integrate into global supply chains, stimulating domestic consumption and creating a ripple effect across industries. As a homegrown brand that has consistently pushed in support of the 'Make in India' initiative, we are excited that this move will further bring industries together and help scale India's manufacturing ecosystem to new heights. The establishment of five National Centers of Excellence for Skilling is another crucial step in bridging the talent gap, ensuring a future-ready workforce for advanced manufacturing. Further, the creation of a new 'Fund of Funds' for Startups with a \u20b910,000 crore infusion will provide much-needed capital to fuel innovation and entrepreneurship mindset in the startup ecosystem, empower budding entrepreneurs in driving growth.\"The Union Budget 2025 strikes a thoughtful balance between stimulating consumption, maintaining fiscal prudence, and fostering long-term economic growth. The significant tax cuts are a timely move to drive greater consumption, putting more money in the hands of the middle class, which will ultimately boost demand across sectors. The budget reinforces the government\u2019s commitment to building a business-friendly regulatory environment\u2014one that empowers startups and MSMEs to scale with confidence. The push towards MSMEs with enhanced credit guarantees, the introduction of special cards for micro-enterprises, and the \u20b930,000 UPI limit on credit cards for street vendors is a game-changer, promoting financial inclusion, driving digital transactions, and creating employment. Furthermore, the establishment of a mechanism under the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to assess financial regulations is a proactive step toward ensuring regulatory adaptability. By fostering stability and clarity, this initiative will provide much-needed confidence to financial institutions and fintech players alike.\"\u201cThe Union Budget 2025 presents a robust roadmap for India\u2019s industrial and technological advancement. With a strong focus on manufacturing, the National Manufacturing Mission and policy support for industries specifically electric vehicles will further boost consumption and growth of the auto industry. In addition, the emphasis on public-private partnerships in infrastructure development opens up new avenues for collaboration and innovation. Further, the Centres of Excellence in AI and focus on skilling will create a workforce ready for technology-led reinvention of industries, enhancing India\u2019s position as global manufacturing and AI hub.\"The Union Budget rightly prioritizes reviving consumption by focusing on rationalizing the tax burden of the salaried class. The increase of the no-tax limit from \u20b97 lakh to \u20b912 lakh is a significant step in reducing tax and putting more money back into consumers\u2019 hands. This will provide a much-needed boost to consumption, which has been challenging over the past 1-1.5 years.Additionally, initiatives such as the PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana, which aims to support 1.7 crore farmers, are expected to enhance agricultural productivity and rural incomes, stimulating demand in rural India. The emphasis on employment generation, particularly through women\u2019s entrepreneurship, is a welcome and necessary move to unlock India\u2019s true economic potential.\u201cThe Union budget has rightfully given impetus osn boosting the purchasing power of a large population with Tax relaxation and support to Agriculture and farming community. We firmly believe that with more money in hands farmers' capability to adopt new technologies like Drones significantly improves and helps grow the market faster. For electronics manufacturing, the relaxation in Basic Custom duties for certain components is a positive step and a continuation of earlier policy initiatives and will boost indigenous manufacturing. We welcome the union budget in letter and spirit as both developments positively impact the Optiemus Group. We look forward to continuing to support the growth of our economy with our efforts.\u201d\u201cA big thank you to our Hon. Finance Minister for announcing several programs as part of the budget for 2025-26 to give a boost to the geospatial sector. The most important one is the setting up of the National Geospatial Mission to develop foundational geospatial infrastructure and data to facilitate land records modernization, urban planning, and infrastructure design. The users in the government, private sector, and the industry have lived with the lack of good foundational data for a very long time. I believe this announcement will provide the necessary resources to create geospatial data that will serve as a foundation for social and economic development. By improving productivity across sectors such as agriculture, natural resources, energy generation and distribution, rural and urban initiatives, and governance, this effort will drive meaningful progress. Investment in research and development fuels economic growth, improves quality of life, and shapes the future. Rs 20,000 crore investment to drive private sector-led R&D and innovation, funds for Deeptech research, 10,000 fellowships under the PM Research Fellowship Scheme, and Rs 500 crore investment for a CoE in AI for education, are transformative steps to make India more competitive at the global level in terms of innovation and IP creation. Overall, the budget has set strong grounds for equipping India with the skills and resources necessary to navigate the evolving global landscape and achieve its vision of being a technologically advanced and prosperous nation.\"\"FM has presented a game changer budget and one most important one in the last 8 years. From last couple of years industry have been candidly requesting FM to increase household consumption, we need to reduce taxes. This is a big boost for the consumer durable industry which has been struggling for the last two years. For the smart tv industry the government has taken unfavourable steps, by exempting basic custom duty only on open cell manufacturing. There are only one or two manufacturers in India which have bonding facilities, by this it will not be an equal playing field for other television manufacturers. The world is dependent on china for open cells and there are only 5 open cell manufacturers out of which 3 have their own retail brands, this policy will only be favourable for Chinese brands and other OEM brands which will manufacture in their plants. This step will definitely hurt Indian smart tv manufacturing plants and it will encourage grey market activities like under invoicing etc.\"",

The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.51% for the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.75%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.28%.\n\nThe consulting company's stock has climbed by 9.15% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.79% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Accenture in its upcoming release. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.78, indicating a 0.36% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $16.59 billion, up 4.97% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.69 per share and revenue of $68.63 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.19% and +5.75%, respectively, from last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Accenture. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.08% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Accenture is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Accenture has a Forward P/E ratio of 30.01 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 29.81, which means Accenture is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computers - IT Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.85 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Let's talk about the popular Accenture plc ( ). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading around its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Accenture\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Accenture?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 10.80% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Accenture today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $343.63, then there isn\u2019t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Accenture\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat does the future of Accenture look like?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Accenture's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ACN\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ACN, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Accenture mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

However, many obstacles, including leadership perceptions of the technology, are preventing widespread adoption by organizations.\n\nTo better understand how organizations are welcoming AI-related change, Accenture surveyed 3,450 C-suite leaders and 3,000 non-C-suite level employees from organizations worldwide with revenues greater than $500 million.\n\nAlso: Microsoft and partners invest $72 million to launch AI Hub in New Jersey\n\nAccording to Accenture's research report, C-suite leaders anticipate a high level of change in their organizations, with 72% expecting more change in 2025 than in 2024, and 23% expecting the same level. Compared to the expectations for change in 2024, the numbers are slightly lower, with 88% of C-suites in 2024 expecting more change than the year prior.\n\nWhile a sense of change is palpable, preparedness levels fall short.\n\nAcross several industries, fewer C-suite leaders reported feeling \"very prepared\" to respond to changes in their business environment heading into 2025, compared to how they felt in 2024.\n\nThe same sentiment was shared by employees, who felt even less confident. The average level of preparedness for C-suite leaders sat at 43%, while employees' confidence fell to 36%. Despite the joint lack of confidence, leaders are prepared to ramp up AI investments.\n\nAccenture\n\nA majority (86%) of C-suite leaders feel prepared to up their investment in generative AI in 2025. Similarly, 83% of the leaders claimed their past year's experience with generative AI has allowed them to see \"greater potential for positive business impact,\" in the upcoming year, according to the report.\n\nMoreover, a whopping 50% of C-suite leaders see IT as the primary focus of those generative AI investments, followed by engineering, manufacturing, production, and operations (38%), and customer service (29%).\n\nThose areas of focus align with what is generally regarded as the subject areas where generative AI tools can provide meaningful assistance, including STEM-related tasks such as coding, bug fixing, malware detection, math calculations, and threat modeling.\n\nGenerative AI also has significant potential to optimize the customer service realm because of its ability to intake robust amounts of data, process it, and then reference it in conversations with customers to answer their questions using natural language.\n\nDespite the perceived benefits, obstacles to adoption remain, with C-suite leaders listing a lack of clarity on ROI (26%) and data or technology infrastructure limitations (28%) as limiting factors.\n\nAlso: OpenAI tailored ChatGPT Gov for government use - here's what that means\n\nThe disconnect between how leadership and employees perceive the value of implementing generative AI is also a major obstacle; there's a 20% gap between how C-suite leaders and their employees understand \"to a great extent\" the potential value of generative AI.\n\nFurthermore, employees are less inclined to feel as though their organizations are trained to use the AI tools efficiently, with 55% of employees reporting that comprehensive training and clear guidance would provide them with a boost in confidence using generative AI tools -- signaling a wider need for an increase in effective communication and training.",

She leads the firm\u2019s Global Talent and Organization Strategy practice, advising C-Suites on effective reinvention journeys enabling the people, technology, and corporate growth agenda. She has an exceptional track record of diagnosing complex organization issues with global clients across industries, highlighting her unique insights in technology, human capability, and engagement to create and deliver 360 value and purpose. Yaarit has been recognized as one of the Top 25 Human Capital Consultants and Leaders of 2023 and 2024 by The Consulting Report and was recently featured by Women We Admire. She is a published author and editor in her field and frequent contributor to business articles. She lives in Atlanta with her family and is originally from South Africa.\n\nRecently, in an exclusive interview with Digital First Magazine, Yaarit shared her professional trajectory, insights on her approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, the secret mantra behind her success, significant career milestones, future plans, words of wisdom, and much more. The following excerpts are taken from the interview.\n\nHi Yaarit. What inspired you to pursue a career in strategy and organizational development, and what motivates you to continue in this field?\n\nI believe that the greatest impact we can have on people\u2019s lives is through their livelihood. I fell into strategic consulting in my early career in South Africa when I was asked to help dismantle apartheid in the company that I was working for. I moved into strategy to improve people\u2019s lives, and I learned how it allows us to have a more significant impact on the health, wealth, and well-being of communities. My focus has always been on making a difference, maintaining integrity, and having a clear sense of purpose. This career has given me the opportunity to help shape companies, impact leaders and their people. It is wonderful to see that CEOs and markets are increasingly valuing people.\n\nWhat do you love the most about your current role?\n\nIn my current role, I am passionate about helping people develop their skills and succeed in their careers. I have the opportunity to shape both the thinking, direction, and way organizations and people bring their ambitions to life. Strategy provides an opportunity to keep one foot in today and one in tomorrow. In strategy, you are surrounded by complex puzzles that are intellectually and emotionally stimulating. Success, to me, is about balancing how far we can go and enabling people to be a part of the future. Every organization is different, but the underlying philosophy involves a growth mindset and systemic thinking.\n\nWhat role do you think technology, such as AI and analytics, will play in shaping the future of talent management and organizational effectiveness?\n\nAI, generative AI, and agentic technologies are rapidly transforming the workplace by handling complex tasks and enabling processes. This year, agentic capability is a key topic at Davos, with CEOs and world leaders making clear that this is the future and they are investing now. This shift will change our work and lives, creating more capacity and impacting operating models and processes. It will allow increasing connectivity and achievement of outcomes we are still to discover. We are truly at the start of this journey.\n\nMost roles will be augmented by technology, with some roles being replaced and new ones created to build capability, teach collaboration with technology, and develop yet unimagined applications. AI and analytics are crucial for enhancing decision-making, processes, improving employee experiences, and driving organizational agility. They can help identify skill gaps, predict future talent needs, and personalize learning and development programs. Today, these technologies enable more effective performance management by providing real-time insights and feedback.\n\nTechnology is moving faster than our ability to consume it, so we need to figure out how to harness its power in a way that makes our lives better.\n\nCan you discuss your approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, and how you help organizations create a more inclusive and equitable culture?\n\nFostering an inclusive environment is essential for organizational success and innovation. I aim to build trust and ensure that diverse voices are heard and valued. I am committed to implementing inclusive policies and practices and have experienced the power of people feeling seen and valued, being able to bring their strengths to work.\n\nYou were recognized as one of the Top 25 Human Capital Consultants and Leaders of 2024. Our readers would love to know the secret mantra behind your success.\n\nI am grateful to be recognized. Not sure that there is any secret. Continuous learning and a commitment to making a positive difference underly my career trajectory. I have been lucky enough to play many roles and learn from all of them. If you have worked with me, I talk about continuous learning and the half-life of knowledge and capability, an abundance mindset, being inclusive, and inviting others in. I aspire to be kind always, (kindness as Adam Grant defines it [doing what helps people improve tomorrow]).\n\nWho has been a significant influence or mentor in your career, and how have they helped shape your professional journey?\n\nThere are so many people that I credit for mentorship throughout my career. A few highlights include an early mentor who shared \u201cpeople will remember you for the 1% that you do, not necessarily do well, so focus on your gaps as well as your strengths\u201d and the people who gave me opportunities long before I felt ready and worthy which enabled me to learn and grow. I know that we are way more impactful when we are a WE vs a ME. I have tried to make space, share credit, care, and challenge in the same way that my mentors have done for me. If I would name anyone, I would be neglecting so many others that I appreciate and value. Two I would call out are my parents, my Mom who taught me to be fierce and my Dad who taught me to be kind.\n\nWhat has been your most career-defining moment that you are proud of?\n\nA crucible moment early in my career was being seconded, to a consortium of clients to be the CEO of a start-up. It gave me an opportunity to step up, create a company, work with the C-Suites of 5 Global companies, solve pressing problems at speed and build a team that would create a sustainable company. Additionally, I am proud of building multiple and diverse practices that have allowed me to have lifelong friendships, make a positive impact and learn.\n\nHow do you prioritize your well-being and self-care amidst a demanding career?\n\nThis is probably the toughest question. I would say that my focus on self-care ebbs and flows. Today, I do prioritize getting sleep, building strength through exercise and walking, taking time out, and eating smartly. My friends are incredibly generous, I am the one who is least present and always traveling. They are kind and inclusive and encourage me to participate and engage and make space and hold no grudges. Most important to me is my family, they keep me grounded, are full of care. My husband and two wonderful children and my nieces and nephew who are like my children. Probably love and care are the best medicine.\n\nWhat are your long-term career aspirations, and how do you see yourself evolving as a leader over the next five years?\n\nI envision myself evolving as a leader by deepening my expertise in emerging technologies and the impact on organizations and people to enable transformations more effectively. Focusing on shaping my legacy and ensuring that I create a positive path for others that is sustainable.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone just starting their career in strategy and organizational development?\n\nWe are all unfinished work. Have high expectations for yourself, strive to show up as the best version of yourself always, AND be open to learning and feedback, be kind to yourself and not overly critical.\n\nEmbrace a mindset of continuous learning by seeking new knowledge and opportunities to expand your experiences and capabilities.\n\nBuild strong, collaborative relationships with friends, colleagues, and be open to great mentors.\n\nUnderstanding the strategic goals of the organizations you work with and aligning your efforts to support these objectives is crucial for driving meaningful impact.\n\nLastly, be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances and embrace new challenges. Flexibility and resilience are key traits in this field.\n\nContent Disclaimer\n\nRelated Articles",

Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $16.59 billion, indicating a 4.97% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.69 per share and revenue of $68.63 billion, which would represent changes of +6.19% and +5.75%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Accenture.

As part of a planned succession, Shiv Iyer, former Americas Consulting and Industry X Lead Executive for Accenture, will become President and join the executive team.\n\nIyer brings over two decades of consulting experience to ASGN. Most recently, he led Accenture\u2019s Consulting and Industry X solutions across the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, scaling the company\u2019s functional, industry, and technological advisory capabilities.

Financial services vendor Fidelity Information Services, better known as FIS, said Jan. 20 that a power outage initiated the disruption.\n\nFIS provides banking operations and payments services to more than 5,800 companies and processed $12 trillion in 2023. A spokesperson for the fintech said the outage was \"due to a local area power loss and a hardware failure\" that occurred on Jan. 15.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nVitalii Vodolazskyi - stock.adob\n\nHow Fiserv's new CEO shakes up succession at two firms\n\nArticle by John Adams\n\nFiserv has appointed PNC executive Michael Lyons to assume outgoing CEO Frank Bisignano's role, bringing a longtime bank executive into the world of technology sales, and leaving an empty seat on the Pittsburgh-based financial institution's talent bench.\n\nLyons became president and CEO-elect of Fiserv, effective Jan. 27. He reports to Bisignano until June 30, or upon Bisignano's earlier Senate confirmation as commissioner of the Social Security Administration for the Trump administration. The move changes succession planning for PNC, which had viewed Lyons as a top candidate to eventually succeed CEO William Demchak.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nAl Drago/Bloomberg\n\nWhat banks can learn from the Treasury breach\n\nArticle by Penny Crosman\n\nMany aspects of the cybersecurity breach the Treasury Department recently disclosed are alarming: the fact that hackers broke in through a tool meant to keep bad actors out, the fact that documents were stolen, the fact that investigators think the perpetrators worked for the Chinese government.\n\nTo these add two more: the hackers lurked inside the Treasury's computers undetected, in what's called an advanced persistent threat. And U.S. banks are susceptible to this same kind of attack.\n\nAmerican Banker has some takeaways from the Treasury breach for banks.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nHow Jenius Bank can afford to pay 4.8% on savings\n\nArticle by Penny Crosman\n\nJenius Bank, a digital-bank division of SMBC Manubank in Los Angeles, has grown from zero to more than $1 billion of assets in a year, with an almost completely remote team.\n\nIt's a rare example of a digital offshoot of a traditional bank that appears to be successful.\n\nIn 2018, several banks launched digital-only brands that were meant to draw in young customers and low-cost deposits from all over the country. JPMorgan Chase's Finn and Wells Fargo's Greenhouse were shut down about a year after launch when they didn't meet expectations; Citizens Bank integrated its Citizens Access digital-only unit back into the main banking app. In some of these cases, the apps were not sufficiently differentiated and cannibalized the banks' existing customer base.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nSOPA Images/Photographer: SOPA Images/LightR\n\nThe so-called Synapse rule and other BaaS challenges of 2025\n\nArticle by Penny Crosman\n\nUnless the new administration squashes it, soon banks and fintechs will need to work with the FDIC's so-called Synapse rule, which would require them to ensure that the balances of custodial deposit accounts are accurate and reconciled on a daily basis.\n\n\"The majority of responsible, embedded finance and innovative banks are doing that today, or they're in the process of making sure that they're able to do that,\" said Phil Goldfeder, chief executive officer of the American Fintech Council. \"The fundamental responsibility of the bank partnering with a fintech company is reconciliation and ensuring that they know what money is coming and going. In bank-fintech partnerships, the buck stops with the regulated entity.\"\n\nFor some smaller banks, this will be a tall order, said Konrad Alt, co-founder of Klaros Group.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nNew York, California gear up to scrutinize bank cybersecurity\n\nArticle by Carter Pape\n\nOver the coming year, state financial regulators in New York are expected to ratchet up their enforcement of cybersecurity regulations as amendments to these rules take effect and examiners scrutinize the details of whether and how banks implement the rules.\n\nRecent enforcement actions by the New York Department of Financial Services have signaled that banks operating in the state will need to pay close attention to what exactly they do to protect nonpublic information, according to Bess Hinson-Greenspan, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight who focuses on cybersecurity and privacy litigation. Hinson-Greenspan spoke about the outlook for state cyber enforcement actions during an event put on by the law firm.\n\nAccording to NYDFS regulations, nonpublic information includes consumers' personal information such as Social Security numbers, but unlike some other regulatory definitions of similar terms, it also broadly covers any information that \"would cause a material adverse impact to the business\" in the case of a data breach.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nchinnarach - stock.adobe.com\n\nHow AI is changing banking jobs: Rise of the 'AI whisperer'\n\nArticle by Penny Crosman\n\nIn June, Citigroup published a research report that predicted artificial intelligence will displace 54% of jobs in the banking industry (based on research from Accenture and the World Economic Forum), more than in any other sector. A Bloomberg Intelligence report released Thursday found that global banks are expected to cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI takes on more tasks.\n\nExperts and anecdotal evidence so far suggest generative AI is changing jobs in banks but not killing them.\n\n\"I'm highly confident it's going to change the way we work, but I think it's going to create different types of work,\" Mike Abbott, global banking lead at Accenture, told American Banker.

Payments-oriented fintech investment totaled $21.4 billion in the first half of 2024, compared with $22.7 billion for all of 2023, according to KPMG data .\n\nAcross all fintech sectors, global investment fell to $51.9 billion in the first half of 2024 from $62.3 billion in the second half of 2023, according to KPMG, noting payments is one of the few sectors within technology where investment is growing.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nHow Stripe 'teaches' tech to beat the payments fraud exam\n\nArticle by John Adams\n\nCrooks start most payments fraud by trying to figure out if the crime is actually worth the effort, sending small probes to see if there is enough money to steal. Stripe contends there is a way to gain the upper hand by leaning on machine learning.\n\nThe payments company says the technology has reduced a type of attack called \"card testing\" by 80% in the past two years. That has come as Stripe's yearly payment volume has grown from about $500 billion to more than $1 trillion during that time, a jump in payments activity that theoretically makes card testing easier.\n\nCrooks use card testing to measure how valuable a stolen card can be by making small phony payments, usually a couple of dollars or less, trying to bury a fraudulent transaction in a sea of legitimate payments, where it's less likely to be noticed.\n\nClick here to read the full article.\n\nRegions Bank deploys tech to take advantage of open banking\n\nArticle by Melinda Huspen\n\nIn the wake of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's release of its long-awaited data sharing rule, many financial institutions, including Regions Bank in Alabama, are stepping up their efforts to share data in a safer and more reliable way.\n\nRegions is partnering with Axway, a data integration provider, to expand future open banking services for Regions' customers. One of Axway's products, Amplify Open Banking, will be integrated into Regions Bank's core systems to upgrade the bank's ability to share data with fintechs and other third-party financial service providers.\n\nIts implementation of Axway's technology will help Regions Bank work toward compliance with the CFPB's recently finalized open banking rule, known as Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the future of Section 1033 is uncertain in the face of pending litigation , many banks are looking to expand their open banking capabilities in anticipation of future competition and consumer demand.",

Acting as a centralised control tower, the new platform streamlines the coordination of AI agents across tasks, systems, and departments, driving productivity and automation at scale.\n\nThousands of pre-built AI agents for IT, HR, and customer service are now available, along with the AI Agent Studio, a no-code platform that allows businesses to build and customise AI agents tailored to specific workflows.\n\nThe AI Agent Orchestrator goes beyond simple task execution, enabling inter-agent communication and centralised coordination. It ensures AI agents share information and manage task handoffs, making them indispensable for handling complex workflows such as customer onboarding or network security incident management.\n\nOrganisations such as EY and Rolls-Royce are already leveraging ServiceNow\u2019s AI agents to enhance operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cAI agents are critical to empower teams with intelligent capabilities working in collaboration between humans and AI,\u201d said Raj Sharma, EY Global managing partner \u2013 growth and innovation. \u201cThis is why we are working with ServiceNow and our ecosystem partners to harness the full potential of agentic AI across our AI platforms at enterprise scale.\u201d\n\nRachel Cameron, head of transformational programmes at Rolls-Royce, said, \u201cBy integrating ServiceNow AI Agents, we are reducing manual effort and enabling faster, data-driven decision-making. AI-powered automation is helping us deflect service desk tickets, optimise workflows, and provide intelligent insights\u2014allowing our teams to focus on high-value activities while ensuring our operations remain efficient, secure, and future-ready.\u201d\n\nServiceNow\u2019s AI agent ecosystem is expanding rapidly, with partners such as Accenture, Cognizant, and Deloitte building new AI agents on the ServiceNow Store. Unlike other AI agents that rely on isolated cloud environments, ServiceNow AI Agents leverage 20 years of enterprise workflow automation data, enabling immediate productivity upon deployment.\n\nAdditionally, the new AI Agent Studio empowers businesses to create custom AI agents using natural language prompts instead of code. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing automation tools, giving organizations the flexibility to develop AI agents for specialized business needs.\n\nThe new features offer AI Agent Orchestrator and AI Agent Studio at no additional cost for Pro Plus and Enterprise Plus customers starting in March. The company\u2019s recent acquisition of Cuein, an AI-native conversation data analysis platform, further strengthens its AI roadmap, ensuring businesses can leverage the latest AI advancements seamlessly.\n\n\u201cServiceNow serves as the AI agent control tower, bringing order to chaos,\u201d said Amit Zavery, president, chief product officer, and chief operating officer at ServiceNow. \u201cAgentic AI without unification creates more complexity within an enterprise. The ability of ServiceNow AI Agents to work together on tasks that draw from multiple systems and departments truly stands out. Our AI agents collaborate like active participants at work, acting as true extensions of their human counterparts.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cWhen companies can get to know future employees, it leads to a stronger workforce,\u201d says Roxanne Mendez, executive director of UCLA Anderson\u2019s Riordan Programs.\n\nMendez has helmed the Riordan Programs since 2012. The programs were established in 1987 to motivate high school and college students and recent college graduates from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds to consider careers in management. The pioneering model encompasses three core programs that incorporate education, mentorship, job development and leadership training.\n\nAmong them, the Riordan Scholars Program gives 75 high school students per year an opportunity to prepare for college and careers as the first generation in their families to pursue higher education. The Riordan Scholars Program also enjoys a thriving partnership with leading global professional services company Accenture, where select Riordan high school and college students have interned since 2021. The internship program has been so successful that Accenture has offered several Riordan interns full-time positions.\n\nEva Bur\u00e9n is Accenture\u2019s global energy retail and consumer services lead. She joined the company\u2019s West Coast team in 2012 and contacted Mendez soon afterward. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the Riordan Scholars Program, having moved from New York at the time Roxanne and I connected,\u201d says Bur\u00e9n. \u201cThanks to her great leadership style, she made it very easy for me to want to start working with her, and rally our amazing Accenture leads.\u201d\n\nThe partnership \u201ctested\u201d very well, says Mendez. Initially, the Riordan Programs staff and board benefited from the company\u2019s advice and help, and together decided to allocate specific opportunities to the scholars. Accenture\u2019s high school and college internship programs predate Bur\u00e9n and Mendez\u2019 collaboration. However, Bur\u00e9n recognized that hiring interns among Riordan Scholars \u201cpresented an outstanding opportunity for Accenture to engage with top talent that brings not only skills, passion, IQ and EQ, but also diversity, which is a core value at Accenture.\u201d\n\nAccenture organizes a working group of five employees that support the Riordan Programs by volunteering as speakers, workshop presenters and judges in the annual Stock Market Competition. They meet monthly with Mendez\u2019 team to discuss how they can help. Two members of the Accenture working group \u2014 Emmanuel Ifediba, a consultant in the company\u2019s health and public safety practice, and Isabel Barraza, a management consultant hired by Accenture full time in 2023 \u2014 are 2018 Riordan Scholars Program alumni.\n\nNow a consultant at Accenture, Emmanuel Ifediba was both a Riordan Scholar and MBA Fellow\n\nIfediba assumed a leadership role in the internship program. He makes regular presentations to high school students, including at Anderson, where he recently shared with seniors in the Riordan Scholars Program what it has taken him to succeed in corporate America as a first-generation college graduate. Having also completed the Riordan MBA Fellows program, Ifediba has been accepted to UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. He credits the Riordan Programs with steering him to Santa Clara University, where he graduated with a B.A. in finance and real estate, and to the Accenture internship that led to a full-time offer.\n\n\u201cAn internship is a great opportunity because students get real-life exposure in a consulting environment,\u201d says Mendez. \u201cThey learn the requirements for specific functions. They become inspired by real professionals and they see that these careers are available to them, too.\u201d\n\nRiordan Scholar Assael Mendez Osuna will join Accenture full time when he graduates from UCLA\n\nQ&A WITH ASSAEL\n\nBarraza couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cThe program exposed me to different careers and roles in the corporate space. I learned that working in \u2018business\u2019 didn\u2019t necessarily mean you had to own your own business or work in finance.\u201d In 2021, Mendez suggested Barraza apply for the Accenture internship, and she was hired for the summer to work on an internal project related to GenAI; more than two years later she\u2019s still with Accenture, now assigned full time to Gap Inc.\n\nThese opportunities arise from the joint dedication to partnerships between the nation\u2019s No. 1 public university and businesses that want to develop, support and benefit from talent locally. But how do students find the Riordan Programs to begin with?\n\nUCLA undergraduate Assael Mendez Osuna (B.A. \u201925) has been affiliated with the Riordan Scholars Program since 2019. His counselor at Lawndale High School had broadcast an email encouraging students to apply. Mendez Osuna remembers, \u201cReading about the requirements and the rigor of the course, I was initially not going to apply. I decided to get out of my comfort zone and take a leap of faith, and it was the best decision I could have made.\u201d Riordan\u2019s College to Career Program paired Mendez Osuna with mentor Daniel Garcia (\u201925), a 2021 graduate of the Riordan MBA Fellows Program and a current student at Anderson. This guidance \u201cwas crucial in helping me determine my career trajectory,\u201d says Mendez Osuna.\n\nRoxanne Mendez (no relation) noticed Mendez Osuna\u2019s creative and entrepreneurial interests and recruited him to apply for the Accenture internship. He was supervised by Accenture\u2019s Sam White, a technology operations consultant. \u201cHe was my first mentor on navigating a project with a client in the augmented reality space,\u201d says Mendez Osuna. \u201cI was tasked with helping draft a report on the client\u2019s vision and analyzing our internal processes for potential challenges. This project helped me approach ambiguity head on.\u201d\n\nWhen Mendez Osuna graduates with his B.A. in international development studies and digital humanities, he\u2019ll join Accenture full time as a management consultant analyst. He says the internship \u201cwas pivotal because it taught me key skills like analytical thinking, storytelling and driving my own deliverables, all of which I still apply. I remember in the beginning overthinking my proposed solutions and wondering if they were good enough. Through the guidance of my supervisors and my peers, I learned the value of not just owning my solutions, but selling them, and taking on roles from analyst to advisor.\u201d\n\nJonathan Cedillo\u2019s internship with Accenture has been extended multiple times\n\nQ&A WITH JONATHAN\n\nJonathan Cedillo was a Riordan Scholar in 2023. He knew about the program because his cousin had completed it in 2016. \u201cThe Riordan Scholars Program sparked my longer-term professional interests in real estate and managing multiple properties. I loved what I learned, and I wanted more of it in my future.\u201d\n\nWhen he was introduced to Accenture and learned what the company does, he says it inspired an interest in business he didn\u2019t know he had. \u201cAccenture aids major companies around the world, especially technology companies. Accenture develops and provides innovative solutions that improve the businesses they serve. Before deciding to major in business, I wanted to major in mechanical engineering, so I believed that by being a part of Accenture I would get exposed to a good combination of business, engineering and innovative technology.\u201d\n\nThe teams at both Accenture and the Riordan Programs encouraged Cedillo to apply for their Skills to Succeed summer internship, which they extended twice. Now Cedillo, a business administration major, is an academic year intern as a business analyst.\n\n\u201cSomething I learned that surprised me was how much testing goes into internal client products. I have been exposed to many internal business practices and teams that I didn\u2019t know were so essential to keeping a business running or developing a product,\u201d says Cedillo.\n\nBoth the Riordan Scholars and their Accenture colleagues experience the internship as an exchange of learning opportunities on a professional as well as human level. \u201cI wanted to engage in something that represented Accenture and made an impact on the SoCal community,\u201d says Bur\u00e9n. \u201cBut also something personal to me. When I learned about the Riordan Programs, I immediately felt a connection because someone close to me is the first person in their family to earn a college degree. I have a lot of respect and admiration for anyone who takes that leap, with all that it involves.\u201d\n\nBarraza was attracted to Accenture because of its diverse workforce and opportunities to try different industries, services and practices. In her turn, she feels like she\u2019s brought to her employer and teammates the practice of \u201cbeing human first and learning about your colleagues.\u201d She, like other interns, says that despite her empowering experience in the Riordan Scholars Program, on entering the workforce, her biggest challenge was imposter syndrome. But, she says, \u201cI learned how important it is to find your community and support system, and how important it is to network, be yourself and share what you\u2019re passionate about. It allows you to connect with team members on a different level, not just because you work on a project together.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Image: Supplied\n\nIn a rapidly evolving digital landscape, creativity and technology are becoming increasingly intertwined. For Accenture Song, the global tech-powered creative group, this fusion is at the heart of its approach. As the company continues to push boundaries in the realm of creativity, technology, and AI, its vision for the future involves elevating the human element of creativity while embracing the transformative power of AI.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, CEO of Accenture Song and founder of Droga 5 David Droga shares insights on how technology is transforming creativity, the role of AI in shaping marketing strategies, and what sets Accenture Song apart as a driving force in the industry.\n\nAccenture Song is the world\u2019s largest tech-powered creative group. How do you envision the intersection of creativity and technology evolving in the next five to 10 years?\n\nCreativity has always had a robust relationship with technology. Every time there\u2019s a technology breakthrough; an argument inevitably follows about how it\u2019s going to devour all jobs and then eventually humanity. Those working in the creative industries have an unhelpful reflex where craft is pitted against tools in an adversarial way. We\u2019re seeing that precise dynamic play out right now with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools.\n\nMy view is the opposite. Technology will make creativity more effective and more human. Creativity needs technology to make it real, and technology needs creativity to make it human. It always has.\n\nOn the one hand, AI will provide opportunities for individuals from all circumstances and backgrounds to become creators. And AI-powered algorithms will play an ever-greater role in how we discover brands and products. The risk that comes with this democratization of tools is that it precipitates a wave of creative mediocrity.\n\nGreat marketing gives way to a flood of \u2018slop\u2019 (a catch-all term for low-quality content). The challenge for creatives is to keep pace with technology while striving for excellence, making sure that we\u2019re surpassing the \u2018average\u2019 and using technology as a tool to elevate our craft.\n\nWhat gives me confidence is that originality, curiosity, and morality cannot be outsourced. In a landscape where everyone has access to similar tools, it\u2019s ultimately taste and context that sets creative output apart.\n\nOver the next five to 10 years, while we might see some existential tussling, we\u2019re also going to see technology enabling creativity \u2013 but not replacing it. Yes, technology drives change. But technology alone is blind. It neither dreams, nor reflects. It is humanity \u2013 the insight, empathy, playfulness, ambition and adaptation \u2013 that gives it purpose.\n\nYour approach integrates design, marketing, commerce, and customer service. How does this holistic strategy drive growth and relevance for your clients in a digital-first world?\n\nWhen clients come to Accenture Song, they are not just walking in through the marketing door. Every challenge comes back to the customer \u2013 from awareness and conversion to customer service and the aesthetic of their stores. And that\u2019s a good thing \u2013 businesses need to act holistically because that is ultimately how their customers think. Nobody is standing in a supermarket aisle thinking \u201cI\u2019m currently in the conversion phase of my relationship with this brand\u201d!\n\nWe offer an integrated approach because consumers live integrated lives. So, it only makes sense that it\u2019s the key to accelerating sustained business growth. For a business to achieve growth, it needs to be relevant, and relevance depends on everything from product innovation to marketing, commerce, sales and service. Our unique position within a consulting giant means we\u2019re equipped to deliver on that for clients.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that clients are looking for multidimensional partnerships that go beyond surface-level solutions in pursuit of longer-term growth. In a complex customer landscape where inaction poses the greatest risk, we\u2019re bringing our expertise to every aspect of a business\u2019s relationship with its customers so that they can navigate that complexity with confidence.\n\nWith generative AI playing a central role at Accenture Song, can you share some examples of how it has delivered tangible business results across marketing, sales, and customer service?\n\nIn 2023, Accenture announced that it\u2019s investing $3bn in our AI and data practice to help our clients navigate this seismic transformation. And it\u2019s paying off: Accenture saw bookings in a total of $3bn for generative AI for FY24. It\u2019s paying off for our clients, too.\n\nFor example, we developed a pioneering gen AI solution for hotel chain, Radisson, that involved creating personalised ad content based on hotel and guest characteristics. Now Radisson employees can identify the most effective messaging for each hotel location, highlighting the relevant features to each audience\u2019s interests throughout the year. This not only improved the relevance of the ads but also increased the likelihood of attracting the right audience. The end result: The company boosted the productivity of its ad teams by more than 50 per cent, while increasing revenue from AI-powered campaigns by more than 20 per cent.\n\nAccenture Song is often compared to traditional advertising companies. What do you believe sets your offering apart, particularly in combining AI with creativity?\n\nOur main industry buyer has evolved from the CMO to the chief growth officer to the CEO. The CMO\u2019s role has greatly expanded too. It\u2019s no longer just about business marketing but about the company\u2019s entire ecosystem and ultimately growth. Who drives that growth? The customer.\n\nIn some corners of the market, they still think of us as being just in the \u2018attention\u2019 space (advertising) but what we do is so much broader than that. Song is responsible for everything related to the customer \u2013 from attention, motivation and inspiration to buying, conversion and scale. And we\u2019ve organised our business around meeting each one of those touchpoints.\n\nThe way we apply creativity goes beyond traditional marketing. As the world\u2019s largest tech-powered creative group, we\u2019re infusing it in novel ways that are unique to Song. For example, we\u2019re pioneering the use of advanced generative AI and real-time graphics capabilities with JLR\u2019s Defender using NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse platform.\n\nAccenture has made significant investments in data and AI. How do these investments shape your creative strategies, and what new opportunities do they create for clients?\n\nIt\u2019s true that we\u2019ve been transforming our organisation. By rapidly and responsibly embedding generative AI into our services, we\u2019re demonstrating the steps businesses can take to both drive profitable growth and fuel reinvention at the pace of the customer. An example of that is our AI Refinery platform developed with NVIDIA to help the world\u2019s enterprises rapidly scale their AI adoption.\n\nWe\u2019re working with clients across many industries to leverage generative AI in creating new products and services; re-invent marketing and commerce by powering, creating, and scaling content and building intelligent sales and services.\n\nWe want our clients to realise the opportunity to set themselves apart by using these technologies to understand their customers better and create content that resonates with specific audiences. Innovative and ethical applications of AI that maintain a strong human element with storytelling and customer interactions will stand the test of time.\n\nIt\u2019s this AI-powered human creativity that people see and experience in the world that is critical for continued relevance.\n\nYou\u2019ve been recognised with prestigious awards like Cannes and the Emmys. How does this creative success shape the future direction of Accenture Song, and what project are you most proud of?\n\nThe awards are of course an honour and validate the hard work and creativity that goes into client work, but the ultimate accolade is when our work sets new precedents. Having such recognition helps inspire us all to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity and makes us a magnet for the absolute best talent in any market.\n\nThere are many projects that I\u2019m proud of. But it is the diversity of our accolades that sets us apart from anyone else. As an example, last year we won the Cannes Lions Film Grand Prix for our beautiful film for the Sydney Opera House. Being great wherever necessary is a powerful mandate.\n\nWith AI becoming more integral to creative industries, how do you ensure the human touch remains a core part of the process, especially when it comes to customer experience?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that technology is going to raise standards and turn what we might currently see as \u2018best practices\u2019 into the norm. But that opens up a space for the \u2018next\u2019 and \u2018fresh\u2019 practices that only imagination, audacity, irreverence, care and exploration can create.\n\nThose human qualities are still necessary to steer technology, ensuring that creativity is relevant and meaningful to people\u2019s lives. Technology is an ever-more sophisticated tool, but as tastemakers and curators, humans still make a difference.\n\nLooking ahead, what excites you most about Accenture Song\u2019s future, and how do you see the company continuing to lead at the intersection of creativity, technology, and AI?\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the future because we recognise the transformative shifts in consumer behaviour and values. Businesses are facing such a huge variety of headwinds on a scale I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen before. But Accenture Song is built to help clients reinvent \u2013 navigating consumer behavior and anticipating and adapting to change is what we do best. There\u2019s no problem too large that we can\u2019t solve. Our clients don\u2019t seek machines, they seek meaning. Their problems are as complex and kaleidoscopic as the modern world itself.\n\nGlobal competition regulatory quagmires, volatile markets, technological changes and the ever-elusive and shape-shifting consumer. They don\u2019t just turn to us for answers but for the confidence to ask better questions.\n\nOur advantage is that 100 per cent of major tech firms are both clients and partners. With these unique relationships we can look around corners to understand the next phase of technology-based acceleration. We represent relevance, ideas and growth. Our remit is to grow business into the future and we\u2019ll keep doing that.\n\nRead: Global digital creative economy to reach Dhs27tn by 2030, finds study",

It states that people, not just technology, will unlock the business potential of generative AI.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccenture\u2019s surveyed executives and employees across the largest India businesses. It revealed that adoption of generative AI is accelerating. 78% of India businesses plan to ramp up AI investment to ready operations for a year of rapid change in 2025. However, that investment is focused on technology, rather than people that will have to use it.

Economic disruption : 48% are not fully prepared (45% somewhat prepared, 3% not very prepared, 1% not at all prepared).\n\nEmployees are even less confident in their organization\u2019s preparedness to respond to any changes in the business environment with 54% reporting their company is not fully prepared.\n\nSaurabh Kumar Sahu, MD and Lead for India Business at Accenture said, \u201cWhile the excitement around generative AI is palpable, it is crucial for Indian businesses to balance their investments in technology with a strong focus on talent development. By aligning people, processes, and technology, we can create a robust ecosystem that not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and innovation. This is the path to staying competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\"\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\nMost recently fielded in November/December 2024, the Accenture Pulse of Change and Employee Surveys gathered insights from 790 C-suite executives as well as 687 non-C-suite level employees across 22 industries and 5 countries in Asia-Pacific (Australia, China, India, Japan, and Singapore).",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Deloitte leads a packed field in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Services.\n\nIn the top-right quadrant, it\u2019s joined by Accenture, Dentsu, and Publicis Sapient.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM and Capgemini are knocking on the leader quadrant\u2019s door as a challenger and visionary, respectively.\n\nHowever, there are many more participants, including the likes of HCLTech, Infosys, and Wipro, across a stacked Magic Quadrant of 16 service providers.\n\nThe Definition of Digital Experience Services\n\nWhether a customer is buying a product online, navigating a mobile app, or receiving proactive alerts, they are on a digital experience (DX).\n\nA DX services provider helps to design, test, implement, optimize, and manage those digital experiences.\n\nHowever, they don\u2019t only focus on customers. The providers in this Magic Quadrant consider digital experiences for employees and partners, too.\n\nIn doing so, they offer services such as experience design, solution implementation, and optimization. They may also offer creative, content, and marketing services.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant Leaders\n\nLeaders in the Magic Quadrant offer a strong track record across DX services while demonstrating an acute understanding of where the market is heading. This year\u2019s leaders are:\n\nDeloitte\n\nAccenture\n\nDentsu\n\nPublicis Sapient\n\nDeloitte\n\nDeloitte earns plaudits in the report for its \u201ccreative agency approach\u201d to digital design, creating programs that include various perspectives, from strategists to creatives. An excellent case study here is of its work with Jackson Family Wines, where it helped develop a distinct digital identity for 40 of its unique brands. Other strengths include its \u201ccomprehensive end-to-end DX capabilities\u201d and \u201cseamless transformational delivery\u201d.\n\nAccenture\n\nAccenture provides \u201cend-to-end\u201d DX services, crossing sales, service, marketing, and commerce. As such, they can offer adept services to support a company-wide digital experience transformation program, which may also span continents. Gartner recognizes this while also crediting the provider for its \u201cspecialized and local capabilities\u201d and its \u201cbroad portfolio of client-deployable assets IP\u201d.\n\nDentsu\n\nDentsu follows its \u201cgood innovation\u201d philosophy, striving to help clients seize new value opportunities that support the broader organization and society. In doing so, it has become a \u201cthought leader in delivering business outcomes\u201d, according to Gartner. The analyst also commends Dentsut for its \u201ccomprehensive DX offerings\u201d and \u201cexpansive portfolio of proprietary DX tools\u201d.\n\nPublicis Sapient\n\nPublicis Sapient has pushed itself to the forefront of the DX services market over recent years, with its stock up 150+ percent since 2020. Key to that success is its \u201clarge-scale industry experience\u201d, with the provider offering customizable solutions across various verticals, with Gartner spotlighting its retail, media, and public sector specialisms. The analyst also lauds Publicis Sapient\u2019s \u201cend-to-end, experience-led delivery\u201d alongside its acquisition strategy.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant Challengers\n\nChallengers in the Magic Quadrant differentiate through execution, especially across their preferred segments of CX. However, their understanding of the market\u2019s evolution seemingly trails those in the leader quadrant. This year\u2019s challengers are:\n\nHCLTech\n\nIBM\n\nInfosys\n\nHCLTech\n\nHCLTech stands out for its tech consulting and engineering expertise. Recently, this came to the fore in a milestone deal with Microsoft, where the tech giant trusted HCLTech to take over its Nuance Enterprise Professional Services business. Alongside this tech focus, Gartner acknowledged HCLTech\u2019s \u201cproduct-aligned operating model\u201d and \u201crobust ecosystem capabilities. Yet, the analyst cautioned toward its limited creative and marketing services.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM is one of the most recognizable names in enterprise tech, with a 100+ year history and around 245,000 employees. Those foundations have enabled the company to develop a \u201cstrong partner ecosystem\u201d. Gartner recognizes this while also applauding its \u201cagency and asset-led approach\u201d and deep domain expertise\u201d. Nevertheless, as with HCLTech, the analyst highlights marketing services as a primary caution.\n\nInfosys\n\nUnlike its fellow challengers, Inosys excels in its services for marketing teams. Indeed, Gartner praises the digital services provider for its \u201cCMO-aligned suite of offerings\u201d and \u201cBPM services for marketing operations\u201d. It also notes the provider\u2019s acquisition nouse as a key strength. However, the analyst notes \u201cinconsistent or siloed delivery\u201d as a concern, which is ironically a consequence of its acquisition strategy that Gartner earlier lauded.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant Visionaries\n\nVisionaries in the Magic Quadrant present a compelling view of the digital services of tomorrow and a well-aligned go-forward strategy. However, they\u2019re yet to demonstrate an execution streak that pairs with that vision. This year\u2019s visionaries are:\n\nCapgemini\n\nEPAM\n\nVML\n\nCapgemini\n\nCapgemini is one of Europe\u2019s largest employers, with 340,000+ staff. Many of these employees are part of the \u201cend-to-end transformation advisory\u201d that Gartner commends in its study. The analyst also notes Capgemini\u2019s \u201cgrowing capability in marketing operations\u201d and \u201cinnovative commercial models\u201d as core strengths. Nevertheless, the provider lags behind leaders primarily because of \u201cinconsistencies in service orchestration.\u201d\n\nEPAM\n\nEPAM supports just under 300 of the Forbes Global 2000 and is growing its agency capability to offer more content, creative, and marketing capabilities to its esteemed clientele. Gartner highlights this as a strength, alongside EPAM\u2019s \u201cgood UI development engineering skills\u201d and \u201cAI-driven transformation for DX services\u201d. However, its \u201creliance on central and eastern European resources\u201d is a worry that \u2013 upon the Ukraine invasion \u2013 came under the microscope.\n\nVML\n\nVML offers a \u201csolid marketing understanding\u201d that it underpins with growing technical capabilities, as per Gartner. The analyst also cites strengths in its \u201cfull range of end-to-end digital growth services and delivery\u201d and \u201cstrong Shopify and SAP expertise\u201d. Nevertheless, its expertise could perhaps be better spread, with Gartner noting that VML has more full-time staff dedicated to Adobe than employees focused on all other ecosystems combined.\n\nGartner Magic Quadrant Niche Players\n\nNiche Players in the Magic Quadrant have established a global presence and often excel in a specific digital experience service. However, they trail on their ability to execute across all use cases and in their vision. This year\u2019s niche players are:\n\nNTT DATA\n\nWipro\n\nCognizant\n\nTata Consultancy Services (TCS)\n\nLTIMindtree\n\nNTT DATA\n\nNTT DATA wins plaudits for its \u201cbreadth of technology orchestration\u201d and \u201cservice-centric industries focus\u201d. Yet, Gartner notes that the provider is better at delivering widescale DX programs as opposed to one-off projects.\n\nWipro\n\nWipro commits approximately 46,000 staff to the DX market. Gartner cites that dedication and the provider\u2019s strong cross-platform technical skills as strengths. Nevertheless, it cautions to Wipro\u2019s limited creative capabilities.\n\nCognizant\n\nCognizant Moment is the provider\u2019s new DX practice, which receives acclaim for its \u201cstrong implementation expertise\u201d and \u201ccommitment to business outcomes\u201d. Nonetheless, Cognizant lags in its \u201climited brand strategy\u201d, while Gartner questions its \u201cadvisory expertise\u201d.\n\nTata Consultancy Services (TCS)\n\nTata has developed innovative solutions suites, like its comms platform that combines CCaaS and CPaaS. As such, it\u2019s little surprise that Gartner commends its \u201cstrong B2B and indirect customer offering\u201d. Yet, the analyst highlights its \u201clagging\u201d agency capabilities as a concern.\n\nLTIMindtree\n\nLTIMindtree is adept at turning a clear DX vision into a reality. Gartner notes this and lauds its design focus and \u201cproduct alignment with market trends\u201d. However, the analyst cautions to LTIMindtree\u2019s \u201climited geographic coverage\u201d and emerging \u201cad and media practice\u201d.\n\nFor more Gartner Magic Quadrant coverage, check out the following articles:",

            "content": "While digital technology undeniably brings in convenience for people and businesses alike, the former are becoming increasingly scrutinising what they see and what they believe as they seek to rebalance technology's role in their lives.\n\nThis is the findings of Accenture's 18th annual Life Trends report, which revealed that people\u2019s response to rapid technological advances is mixed, influenced by increased use of AI and generative AI, recent breakthroughs are impacting society\u2019s digital experiences.\n\nThis shift in the dynamics of people's trust must be carefully taken into consideration by businesses and organisations to be able to adapt their strategies to meet their clients' needs.\n\nAccenture says insights crowdsourced from around the globe helped identify five macro-consumer trends forecasting the changing dynamic between technology and users, and the challenges and opportunities for brands as they adapt their strategies to meet evolving customer needs.\n\nCost of Hesitations: The trustworthiness of digital technology is under threat as a rise in scams blurs the lines between real and deceptive content. Generative AI is amplifying this confusion, challenging people\u2019s trust in digital platforms. Accenture research shows about half of people in China now question online content\u2019s authenticity. Trust erosion is impacting online shopping and brand interactions, with 38% of people in China saying buying online is a mess these days. Brands must reassure customers by creating beacons of trust in communications, commerce, and product.\n\nThe Parent Trap: Parents face the challenge of helping the next generation build a healthy relationship with digital technology. Unrestricted access to the internet and social media is influencing extreme behaviors and exposing young people to many different types of harm. Parents are seeing the effects and feeling the urgency, so they\u2019re mobilising to establish guardrails as governments work on top-down policy. Accenture findings reveal that 64% people in China are aware of technology (algorithms) aiming to keep them long on social media sites, while less have taken the action to remove apps on devices (23%) or notifications (18%).\n\nImpatience Economy: Many cultures emphasise that education, hard work, and determination can shape a desired future. However, last year\u2019s Decade of Deconstruction trend revealed that goals and priorities are increasingly shifting. Today, eight out of ten consumers in China say they wish companies would respond faster to their changing needs. About 77% now prefer quick solutions over traditional methods, often turning to crowd-sourced information for faster results, willing to take the risk, even for health and financial goals. Notably, influencers were once largely focused on style, travel and music but their remit has expanded to include life fundamentals like health, wealth and happiness. When companies fall short, consumers look to the digital crowd, pushing brands to keep up to maintain loyalty.\n\nThe Dignity of Work: The dignity of work is increasingly being tested by business pressures, technological advances and shifting dynamics. As generative AI enters the workplace, dignity needs to be factored into new expectations around how people will work with the technology. More than eight out ten people in China find generative AI tools helpful at work, saying that they make work more efficient (43%) and improve the quality of work (35%), while some are concerned that they limit creativity (11%), make work more transactional (22%), and create anxiety about job security (11%). Leaders must foster motivation and agency, as they are key to producing high-quality work.",

            "content": "Consultancy-me.com\n\nAuthor: Muqsit Ashraf is the Global CEO of Accenture Strategy and Global co-lead of the Strategy & Consulting business\n\nWhile the UAE has long been known as an energy powerhouse and a tourism hub \u2013 which remain a key part of its story \u2013 it is also focused on driving innovation in areas such as transforming their social welfare programs, fortifying their public services, or most recently, setting out to be a leader in AI.\n\nEvery action, every message has helped advance its story toward economic diversification and capitalizing on technological advancements. Moving quickly and intentionally to become a leader in AI \u2013 launching in Falcon an open-source, sovereign large language model ahead of most nations, recently quadrupling its AI workforce and hosting multiple data centers to support the technology \u2013 are just the latest moves in this effort.\n\nIn announcing Falcon, for instance, the UAE Government\u2019s research group shared that it could power chatbots and image generators like other generative AI tools, and in its latest iteration, claims to be the first LLM model with image-to-text conversion.\n\nAt the heart of this rise in AI tools, which has been underpinned by ChatGPT and generative AI more broadly coming onto the scene two years ago, is a clear reminder of how important agility and intentionality can be for leaders.\n\nWith the technology moving from media headlines into my boardroom discussions with CEOs and C-suite leaders, what\u2019s clear is that \u2013 despite most using AI and wanting to leverage it to advance business growth \u2013 less than a third of companies are seeing the value that they\u2019re seeking from AI.\n\nPart of that is because unlocking this value requires a full reimagining and continuous reinventing of functions, processes and most other ways of working within an organization. It begins with \u2013 and is enabled by \u2013 a strong digital core that combines the right data and technology with people at the very center.\n\nAt a time of constant change, where business leaders rank technology as the most disruptive force for companies, up from the number 6 position just two years ago, having a robust digital core can put businesses on track to meet the current digital transformation needs.\n\nThe Digital Core: Foundation for AI-Driven Transformation\n\nSo, what is the digital core? At Accenture, we define the digital core as the critical technological capability to create and empower an organization\u2019s reinvention ambitions. It means reintegrating advanced digital platforms, having a seamless data and AI backbone and building a secure foundation using new engineering principles.\n\nEnterprises that have done this well have seen 60% higher revenue growth rate and 40% higher profitability. They\u2019ve adopted a digital core tailored to their industry and company, consistently increased investments in innovation and have addressed technical debt in their IT systems.\n\nEnergy companies for instance are facing rapid change ahead, which will require new skillsets. Technologies like robotics and drones will account for 20% of the global workforce by 2028. To address these changes effectively, energy leaders must focus on moving quickly to modernize their technology operations and shifting away from legacy infrastructures.\n\nA sign of their efforts has been consistent investment in technology like generative AI, data analytics, machine learning and cloud to drive three primary goals: operational excellence (71%), increased employee productivity (40%) and business resilience (31%).\n\nCustomizing the Digital Core\n\nA digital core goes hand in hand with new ways of working and adoption of new operating models, methods and processes alongside expanding employee skillset. For energy companies, as an example, this can mean a shift away from legacy IT systems that are often siloed to a more comprehensive view of their technology foundations that can help drive decision-making.\n\nWhen built well, a strong digital core can enable companies to have:\n\nData Integration and Accessibility: Breaking down silos to create a unified view of enterprise data.\n\nReal-Time Analytics: Providing instant insights to speed up decision-making.\n\nScalability: Allowing rapid deployment of AI solutions across the organization.\n\nEnhanced Security: Protecting valuable data assets and AI models from threats.\n\nA multinational oil company, for example, successfully enabled its crews to make decisions on and deliver operations remotely by migrating to the cloud, leading to significant operational cost savings and to better user experience. And a US chemicals company used AI-enabled market analysis tools to create a relevant value proposition, and further, equip sales and engineers with the data to better anticipate and address customer demands.\n\nLeading the way\n\nThe companies that are well suited to make AI a success are those that are intentional about building a strong digital core and using AI to address challenges specific to their business.\n\nWith the economic potential for technology like generative AI to reach $10.3 trillion by 2038, the imperative couldn\u2019t be clearer: companies must adapt to these technological advancements, or risk being left behind while their peers gain a competitive advantage.",

            "content": "Research from Google and Accenture suggests that an increasing number of Australians and businesses are using artificial intelligence, which may not come as a surprise. However, there is a significant disparity in the number of employees who feel equipped to use AI, and what C-suite executives perceive that number to be.\n\nGoogle polled 1,000 Australians and found that 49% used generative AI in the last year, up from 38% in 2023. This rise is accompanied by a new level of optimism. The proportion of people who believe AI will benefit them increased by 6%, and the percentage who think it will change work for the better within five years rose by 7%.\n\nAccenture surveyed 790 C-suite executives and 687 non-C-suite level employees across five Asia Pacific countries, including Australia, for its Pulse of Change report. A whopping 87% of the leaders said they planned to boost their AI investment in 2025, and 91% believe their employees are able to use the technology efficiently.\n\nEmployees feel differently, though: Only 70% feel prepared to make the most of AI at work. Furthermore, just 30% of them claim to understand the potential value of GenAI \u201cto a great extent,\u201d compared to 55% of APAC C-suite leaders.\n\nWhile 70% of workers feel they have received adequate AI training, 91% of C-suite leaders believe their employees are set up to use it. This suggests the AI training being provided may not meet employees\u2019 specific needs.\n\nSEE: Australian IT Skills Shortage and Self-Upskilling\n\nThe Accenture research also looked at employees\u2019 concerns around AI, which may shine light on the areas where training should be focused. Non-users of AI at work cite concerns about inaccuracies (27%), lack of resources (26%), and integration struggles (22%).\n\nAI skilling has been identified as a key gap in Australia, with many employees consistently saying their organisations talk about AI tools but do not invest in the people using them. The country needs 312,000 additional tech workers by 2030 to meet demand, or more than 60,000 new entrants annually in the tech workforce.\n\nIn December, Australia announced plans to develop a national AI strategy to strengthen its AI capabilities and attract investment, aiming to unlock the $600 billion of productivity potential of these technologies. Microsoft also committed to equipping one million people across Australia and New Zealand with essential AI skills by 2026.\n\nMatt Coates, technology lead for Accenture in Australia and New Zealand, said in a press release: \u201cToo many organisations view generative AI solely as a technological solution, rather than as a driving force to rethink talent strategies.\n\n\u201cWhile investments in AI continue to grow, many still face significant challenges in understanding, training, and implementation.\u201d\n\nAI skills gap should be addressed to prepare for continuous change\n\nBoth reports suggest that Australian businesses are aware that changes related to AI adoption are ongoing. Google\u2019s survey found that 54% of workers hope that automation will free them up to focus on more rewarding work, but 46% think that it will put pressure on them to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOver time, Australians are getting more optimistic, confirming that certain aspects of AI doomerism were overblown. For instance, the portion of Google respondents who think that jobs and industries will change for the better within the next five years thanks to AI increased by 7% in a year.\n\nFewer Australians now think their roles will be absorbed by AI, with the percentage dropping from 20% in 2023 to 12% in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see Australia move beyond experimentation to action, harnessing AI to create real-world benefits \u2014 and it\u2019s exciting to think about the potential benefits to our economy,\u201d said Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, in a blog post.\n\nSEE: 5 Generative AI Trends to Watch in 2025\n\nThe Accenture respondents also predict industry disruption, with 79% of employees believing their roles will be impacted by AI. \u201cOnly a third of executives have a clear vision for how generative AI will impact their workforce,\u201d Coates said. \u201cThis emphasises the importance of a strategic approach that harmonizes technology and human talent to fully realise the power of reinvention that gen AI provides.\u201d",

            "content": "Banks were a proving ground for the value of digital transformation and cloud migration. Now, the sector is helping make a compelling case for generative AI, thanks to its mountains of ingestible data siloed away in cavernous legacy systems.\n\nThe success of banking rests on its ability to rapidly and reliably process millions of daily transactions at scale \u2014 an undertaking that inherently benefits from a combination of cloud and AI.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the bank, technology is increasing in importance, as it has been for the last five decades,\u201d said Michael Abbott, Accenture\u2019s global banking lead.\n\nThe challenge as the next wave of modernization crests is to leverage complex technologies to simplify systems and processes, according to Accenture\u2019s 2025 banking trends report.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is going to impact every function within a bank \u2014 every single part of the job,\u201d Abbott said, pointing to agentic solutions tailored to manage dispute resolutions and coding assistants trained to refactor legacy applications.\n\nThe impacts are already apparent across the industry.\n\nCiti armed 30,000 developers with generative AI coding tools and rolled out a pair of generative AI-powered productivity enhancement platforms to its broader workforce last year. Goldman Sachs aims to furnish roughly 10,000 employees with an AI assistant by the end of the year, the bank\u2019s CIO, Marco Argenti, told CNBC last week.\n\nA technology step-change\n\nAs enterprises worked through generative AI pilots, accuracy and reliability emerged as concerns, particularly for customer-facing use cases. While issues persist, large language model-based coding assistants have come a long way in the past year, Abbott said.\n\nTools that can help engineers refactor COBOL applications were, by Abbott\u2019s estimation, 70% to 75% accurate a year ago. Now, they achieve closer to 98% or 99% accuracy in reverse engineering legacy code.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just translating from COBOL to Java \u2014 now you can transform the application, move it into an [application programming interface], and forward engineering is going to improve in leaps and bounds this year,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to forward-engineer the application into any code base you want.\u201d\n\nThe economics of generative AI are becoming more favorable, as well, even as many companies struggle to achieve returns on their AI investments.\n\nJPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto said last fall the bank expects its LLM Suite and other AI capabilities to create $2 billion in value.\n\n\u201cCIOs should understand that the cost of this stuff is collapsing \u2014 the API cost for OpenAI services has come way down,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nAccenture tracked a 74% annual cost decline between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo from December 2021 to December 2024. GPT-4\u2019s annualized cost came down 58% between March 2023 and the end of last year, the firm found.\n\nHyperscale cloud providers have continued to pour tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure to support model training and inference. Abbott compared the economics of a data center gold rush to the 19th-century U.S. transcontinental railroad boom.\n\n\u201cIt costs an enormous amount of money to build the first model and train it, just as it takes a lot of capital to lay a railway track,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cBut once you got the track laid, moving a ton of coal a mile is marginally cheap.\u201d\n\nAbbott pointed to the January release of DeepSeek-R1, an open-source model family with greatly reduced usage fees compared to ChatGPT, as a harbinger of cost reductions to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to tell if large banks will use DeepSeek, but it is open and freely available so they can analyze it and understand everything in there,\u201d Abbott said.",

            "content": "Photograph by CSP Staff\n\nRetailers at the Conexxus conference in Tucson, Arizona, on Monday learned about three artificial intelligence (AI) use cases: call center assistance, personalized messaging and fuel forecasting and demand.\n\nChatGPT is the fastest-adopted technology in the world, Richard Taylor, senior manager of strategy and consulting for energy and mobility retail at Accenture, a consulting company based in Dublin, said during a session.\n\n\u201cIt took, I think, less than 60 days to get over 100 million users,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that's less time TikTok, Instagram, all the social media platforms\u2014pretty alarming to think about.\u201d\n\nWith artificial intelligence growing so quickly, how can convenience-store retailers leverage it for their business? Taylor gave three examples.\n\nCall Center Assistance\n\nUtilizing AI within the call center provides retailers with the ability to redistribute labor and learn from the data it collects.\n\nWithout AI, to understand areas of operation that need improvements, someone has to listen to a good portion of those calls to assess what they called about, if the customers problem is solved and if the agent followed their script, he said. That\u2019s about 500 hours of labor per month. Large fuel and convenience leaders with 1,000 or more stores in the United States receive 3,000 to 4,000 customer calls monthly, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cNow, what we've done in this situation is we've taken the audio files, we've got that translated into scripts, and we ran that through the technology, and we've been able to process that within 15 minutes, and what we get on the other side is a large amount of data,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAI can track call time and purpose and provide scores to agents based on if they followed their script and left the customer happy. The technology can also highlight aspects of the business customers are most frustrated with and recommend a plan to improve it.\n\nIt can also collect data on customer sentiment, such as if a caller is frustrated but polite or frustrated but upset.\n\n\u201cThink of the time that you save with this but also think of the rich data that we've been provided in order to take these insights and actually drive better results on our help desk,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nPersonalizing Customer Experience\n\nUnlocking new, personalized experiences for customers is another way to leverage AI.\n\nAI cameras can detect information about who pulls into the fuel pump by analyzing visual details.\n\n\u201cWe're able to leverage video and camera footage to understand a whole host of different information,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThink about the customer profile. Do they have any children in the car? What's the mood of the person when they turn into site? How much do they normally spend based on the look and the feel of their car? What does the vehicle look like? Where are you located? What's the temperature and what's the time of day?\u201d\n\nAnd if that customer is a loyalty member, there's even more data work with.\n\n\u201cThe technology then chooses that best offer for the person based off their data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe outcome is the best offer at the right time, delivered in the best way. We are able to flash [an ad] up, either in the forecourt or on the pump screen to actually drive more revenue into the store and give our customers a more personalized experience.\"\n\nFuel Forecasting and Demand\n\nImagine bringing in macro data in addition to the micro data to get a better understanding of how much fuel to order, Taylor said.\n\nMacro data can include any current geopolitical incidents, supply chain issues, sports events in the area and more.\n\n\u201cAll of these different data points will allow us to really hone in and accurately predict [fuel] demand,\u201d he said.\n\nTaylor gave an example of how an AI system might monitor these data points and recommend a solution. The system in his example detected and alerted a retailer that it had lost 2% market share in southern Florida, amounting to a lost fuel margin of $18,000 and a lost convenience margin of $38,000. From there, it recommended how the retail could best manage the loss.\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

Executives ET spoke to said such programmes not only help build a more supportive workplace, but also boost productivity and reduce absenteeism and attrition.Earlier this month, Zomato set up a fitness centre in Gurgaon, which the company says is used by 300 employees per day, and has an in-house wellness team of 15 professionals, including counsellors and trainers.The centre, set up in partnership with The Wellness Co, offers new-age therapies like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cryotherapy, and an infrared sauna.\u201cThe facility has seen strong early adoption, with over 60% of our Gurgaon team utilising these services in the first month,\u201d said Niharika Mohanty, vice-president of HR, Zomato.Accenture hosts well-being carnivals for its employees across India. Over the last year, the company has organised more than 300 sessions focused on physical, mental and financial well-being, including health screenings, expert-led interactive workshops on topics like cardiac care, oncology, ergonomics, mindfulness, nutrition, financial planning, and fitness activities like yoga, tai chi, and zumba.\u201cWe believe that leaders who prioritise their own well-being can enhance their own as well as their teams' well-being and create a positive ripple effect. Towards that we provide them with personalised coaching on mindfulness, movement, ergonomics, nutrition, etc.,\u201d Lakshmi C, CHRO at Accenture in India, told ET.A survey by insurtech platform Plum last year found that eight in 10 employees weigh the quality of benefits as a factor to stay at a company or leave, and despite tight market conditions, employers are investing in comprehensive healthcare packages, keeping in mind the importance of tailored benefits.Mental and emotional well-being is also in focus in an effort to build a more supportive workplace culture.Publicis Sapient, a digital business transformation and consulting firm, is rolling out mental health ally training for its people managers this year. The initiative aims to equip managers with the skills to recognise signs of distress and provide appropriate support, ensuring that mental health is prioritised at every level of leadership, said Shefali Sharma Garg, India people success lead, Publicis Sapient.It is also setting up peer-to-peer support networks - closed groups which will allow people to connect based on common themes like young motherhood, domestic abuse, single parenting, and complex mental health concerns. Preventive healthcare is a priority at Wells Fargo, with the company giving employees access to onsite clinics and doctors at all its office locations.\u201cOur enhanced annual health check that includes checking for specific cancer and heart health markers got close to 50% uptake in 2024, and last year\u2019s gamified health and fitness challenge saw more than 30% of our employees participating to boost their fitness levels,\u201d said Yash Mohan, head of HR \u2013 India and the Philippines region. The firm sees an average of 80 employees a day at its onsite clinics across locations for preventive care.This year, it intends to bring back other health checks like the breast health screening and gamified fitness challenges.Others like Adobe run a well-being reimbursement programme, which allows employees to claim reimbursements for various activities and tools promoting physical, emotional, and mental health. These can include pet care, gym memberships, fitness classes, mindfulness apps, sports gear, and more.",

We\u2019re here in Davos \u2014 isn\u2019t this the global collaboration village? And in some sense, yes, it is.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut as Davos and our annual meeting gets more crowded, we want to see if there are ways for us to extend impact throughout the world, 365 days a year.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s debut of Next-Gen AR at Davos has focused on collecting feedback to refine the platform.\n\n\u201cThis is a platform in which we want to stoke more conversation between public entities and private entities,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAs you build a platform and any technology product, you want to hear the feedback of, well, what worked well, what didn\u2019t work well. And what better way to do that than here (at the annual meeting), where all of our constituents and users are here.\u201d\n\nHuang emphasized the importance of user input in shaping the experience.\n\n\u201cThe graphics are higher fidelity, they\u2019re photorealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re mixing virtual reality in some cases where we want to transport you to a location, but other times we just want to sit around a table, visualize a 3D object, and say, \u2018Hey, have you noticed this thing?\u2019 or, \u2018Have you noticed that thing?\u2019 Using augmented reality when it\u2019s apropos.\u201d\n\nFeedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cThe most-used term this week has been: Wow,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWhen you see the state-of-the-art hardware and software these days, it is a wow moment.\u201d\n\nThe tech offers an alternative to traditional 2D communication platforms such as Zoom or PowerPoint by immersing users in a 3D environment.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to anyone that\u2019s ever been in an immersive environment, it changes your perception,\u201d Huang explained. \u201cThrough that immersiveness, there is a higher level of engagement.\u201d\n\nThe platform also aims for inclusivity and device-neutrality. \u201cNext-Gen is available not only with Meta devices but Apple\u2019s Pro as well, and in the future, we want to add more devices onto that as well,\u201d Huang said.\n\nOne example of the platform\u2019s potential lies in its use by Saudi Arabia at this year\u2019s WEF to showcase the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 initiative.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, I don\u2019t live in Saudi Arabia, I don\u2019t live in the region. It might seem very foreign to say, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s this Vision 2030, where they\u2019re trying to transform an entire country and society,\u2019\u201d Huang said.\n\n\u201cYou can send around leaflets, you can watch that on YouTube, or maybe get a PowerPoint, but will that actually show and demonstrate what\u2019s really going on? You could say nothing can replace going there. But is there an in-between? That\u2019s where the Global Collaboration Village can shine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GCV mission is clear; to foster collaboration, spark innovation and enable participants to visualize solutions in transformative ways.\n\nHuang concluded: \u201cWe want this platform to be a space where global solutions can be visualized, tested and realized \u2014 ultimately shaping a better future for all.\u201d",

I realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you\u2019ll mostly put US first\u201d.\n\nMusk is leading Trump\u2019s government efficiency efforts and will also be advising him on spending. The billionaire, ever since leaving OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018, has been engaged in a feud with Altman. Sources close to Stargate also reveal that they are not sure how Musk has arrived at the figure. According to them, the company is well-positioned to deploy $100 billion.\n\nIn light of this, Bloomberg revealed that Trump has, on several occasions, promoted private-sector investment promises that never went on to materialize. One of these failed promises has been the failed Foxconn factory project which Trump deemed as the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World\u201d. No wonder the Stargate announcement has sparked skepticism regarding the project\u2019s completion.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBanks were a proving ground for the value of digital transformation and cloud migration. Now, the sector is helping make a compelling case for generative AI, thanks to its mountains of ingestible data siloed away in cavernous legacy systems.\n\nThe success of banking rests on its ability to rapidly and reliably process millions of daily transactions at scale \u2014 an undertaking that inherently benefits from a combination of cloud and AI.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the bank, technology is increasing in importance, as it has been for the last five decades,\u201d Michael Abbott, Accenture senior managing director and global banking lead, said.\n\nThe challenge as the next wave of modernization crests is to leverage complex technologies to simplify systems and processes, according to Accenture\u2019s 2025 banking trends report.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is going to impact every function within a bank \u2014 every single part of the job,\u201d Abbott said, pointing to agentic solutions tailored to manage dispute resolutions and coding assistants trained to refactor legacy applications.\n\nThe impacts are already apparent across the industry.\n\nCitigroup armed 30,000 developers with generative AI coding tools and rolled out a pair of generative AI-powered productivity enhancement platforms to its broader workforce last year. Goldman Sachs has furnished roughly 10,000 employees with an AI assistant to date and expects to complete companywide rollout by the end of the year, the bank\u2019s CIO Marco Argenti told CNBC this week.\n\nA technology step-change\n\nAs enterprises worked through generative AI pilots, accuracy and reliability emerged as concerns, particularly for customer-facing use cases. While issues persist, LLM-based coding assistants have come a long way in the last year, Abbott said.\n\nTools that can help engineers refactor COBOL applications were, by Abbott\u2019s estimation, 70% to 75% accurate a year ago. Now, they achieve closer to 98% or 99% accuracy in reverse engineering legacy code.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just translating from COBOL to Java \u2014 now you can transform the application, move it into an API, and forward engineering is going to improve in leaps and bounds this year,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to forward engineer the application into any code base you want.\u201d\n\nThe economics of generative AI are becoming more favorable, as well, even as many companies struggle to achieve returns on their AI investments.\n\nJPMorgan Chase executives expect the bank\u2019s LLM Suite and other AI capabilities to create $2 billion in value, President and COO Daniel Pinto said last fall.\n\n\u201cCIOs should understand that the cost of this stuff is collapsing \u2014 the API cost for OpenAI services has come way down,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nAccenture tracked a 74% annual cost decline between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo from December 2021 to December 2024. GPT-4\u2019s annualized cost came down 58% between March 2023 and the end of last year, the firm found.\n\nHyperscale cloud providers have continued to pour tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure to support model training and inference. Abbott compared the economics of a data center gold rush to the 19th-century U.S. transcontinental railroad boom.\n\n\u201cIt costs an enormous amount of money to build the first model and train it, just as it takes a lot of capital to lay a railway track,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cBut once you got the track laid, moving a ton of coal a mile is marginally cheap.\u201d\n\nAbbott pointed to the January release of DeepSeek-R1, an open-source model family with greatly reduced usage fees compared to ChatGPT, as a harbinger of cost reductions to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to tell if large banks will use DeepSeek, but it is open and freely available so they can analyze it and understand everything in there,\u201d Abbott said.",

The Artificial Intelligence market value is projected to grow to $826.70 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 27.7%.\n\nFurther, as per a report by IMARC Group, with big data and predictive analytics fueling the data analytics market growth, the market is poised to hit around $482.61 billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 23.1%. Also, increasing amounts of structured and unstructured data and reliance on analytics to extract meaningful insights by organizations are shaping the data analytics market.\n\nBesides, in the coming time, the integration of data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will expand as more and more companies seek to use AI algorithms to analyze large sums of data and extract deeper insights and patterns, resulting in better decision-making and improved efficiency.\n\nThis will create favorable tailwinds for companies engaged in analytics operations, turning information into profit.

            "content": "AI-powered skills intelligence platform Workera has announced a strategic investment from consulting giant Accenture.\n\nAs a result of the investment, Accenture, which generated a revenue of approximately $65 billion in 2024, will be able to provide its global clients with Workera\u2019s solutions, with the aim of accelerating the adoption of skills-first strategies.\n\nThis [deal] underscores the shared vision between Workera and Accenture to advance skills-first strategies across global enterprises,\u201d Kian Katanforoosh, CEO of Workera said in an exclusive conversation with UNLEASH.\n\n\u201cBy combining Workera\u2019s expertise in verified skills intelligence with Accenture\u2019s global scale, we aim to help organizations build the capabilities they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about more than reskilling \u2013 it\u2019s about enabling companies to align their talent strategies with business needs and unlock valuable new opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nWorking together to close the global skills gap\n\nThe investment will allow Accenture to accelerate a skills-first approach, which is vital, as recent research from the company found that 61% of global workers will need reskilling by 2027.\n\nAlthough a large proportion of these employees (94%) express a willingness to learn new skills, only 5% or businesses are focused on reskilling their workforce at scale.\n\nCertain fields, such as AI, machine learning, and cloud computing, are seeing rapid growth, meaning that employees are required to upskill at a much quicker rate, in comparison to other fields.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that when enterprises leverage verified skills data, they can precisely identify gaps, personalize development plans, and benchmark and measure growth in any skill, including AI, data, and cloud computing,\u201d Katanforoosh explains.\n\n\u201cThis data-driven approach not only accelerates learning but also helps leaders make better-informed decisions about talent allocation and workforce planning.\u201d\n\nThe Accenture research also highlights that technical expertise used to remain relevant for over a decade, now, many require reskilling or upskilling in just four years. For industries such as AI, this can be done even sooner.\n\nConsequently, Accenture\u2019s investment in Workera will enable both businesses to partner on its skills intelligence platform, LearnVantage, which aims to address the rapidly shortening half-life of technical skills.\n\nKishore Durg, Global Lead of Accenture LearnVantage explained that by integrating Workera with Accenture LearnVantage, the business will aim to equip enterprises with the tools to \u201cpersonalize their learning journeys, while optimizing their workforce capabilities by using skills intelligence data.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Katanforoosh notes: \u201cLeaders now have a clear pathway to benchmark and address skill gaps in all areas including the most sought after skills like AI, cloud, and data, ensuring their workforce is prepared for the demands of tomorrow.\n\nThis partnership empowers HR teams to align talent development with strategic business goals, building a stronger, more capable workforce that can adapt to change.\u201d\n\nStay tuned.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) companies are rapidly focusing on securing funding to propel R&D, roll out products and services across diverse sectors, and create interconnected ecosystems amid fierce industry competition. According to Reuters analysis of PitchBook data, AI startups have single-handedly contributed to the rebound of US venture capital funding, as total capital raised last year jumped 30% year over year.\n\nMore importantly, AI startups comprised 46.4% of the total $209 billion raised in 2024, as optimism around AI-powered technology sparked a year-long market rally led by tech giants and semiconductor leaders.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the rapidly evolving technology as tech leaders prioritise enforcing guardrails to ensure the best use of AI.\n\nOpenAI CEO at Davos 2024\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during his speech at Davos 2024: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that we and others are being held to a high standard. We can draw on lessons from the past about how technology has been made to be safe and how different stakeholders have handled negotiations about what safe means.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet society and the technology co-evolve, and sort of step-by-step with a very tight feedback loop and course correction, build these systems that deliver tremendous value while meeting safety requirements,\u201d he added.\n\nOverall, the global markets are optimistic about how leading companies are increasingly developing and integrating AI in their workflows and strategies globally. PWC\u2019s AI Global Study projected that the AI industry could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, boosting GDP for local economies by 26% on average. Here are the top 10 AI stocks driving the transition to a new era of product development, data flow, and sustainability in 2025.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "content": "The investment underscores Workera's leadership in verified skills intelligence and highlights Accenture's commitment to empowering organizations with skills-based training in technology, data, and AI\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Workera, the leading AI-powered skills intelligence platform, today announced a strategic investment from Accenture (NYSE: ACN) marking a significant milestone in their strategic alliance. This multi-faceted alliance includes a strategic investment by Accenture, a reseller collaboration enabling Accenture to deliver Workera's solutions to clients globally, and a technology integration establishing Workera as the official skills intelligence layer within Accenture's LearnVantage platform. Together, the companies aim to accelerate the adoption of skills-first strategies, helping organizations navigate the complexities of today's talent landscape.\n\nThe partnership comes at a pivotal time. Accenture research reveals that 61% of workers worldwide will require retraining by 2027. While 94% of employees express readiness to learn new skills, only 5% of organizations are effectively reskilling their workforce at scale. The challenge is particularly pronounced in high-demand fields like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing, where skill requirements continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace.\n\nThis collaboration builds on Accenture's April 2024 selection of Workera as a skills intelligence partner for LearnVantage, a comprehensive learning platform designed to address the rapidly shortening half-life of technical skills. Where technical expertise once remained relevant for a decade or more, many skills now require reskilling and/or upskilling within just four years\u2014and even sooner in cutting-edge areas like generative AI and machine learning.\n\n\"The rise of generative AI has amplified our clients' need for training and upskilling their people in cloud, data, and AI as they build their digital core, which is essential for reinvention,\" said Kishore Durg, global lead of Accenture LearnVantage. \"By integrating Workera into Accenture LearnVantage, we're equipping enterprises with the tools to personalize learning journeys and optimize workforce capabilities using skills intelligence data. This partnership, including our recent investment, underscores Accenture's commitment to delivering transformative value to our clients.\"\n\n\"Workera's expertise in skills intelligence, combined with Accenture's global reach and innovative solutions, will redefine how organizations approach workforce development,\" said Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of Workera. \"Together, we are advancing the skills-first movement, empowering companies to align their talent strategies with business objectives and unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation.\"\n\nTo learn more about how Workera can help you with workforce transformation initiatives in 2025, please visit www.workera.ai.\n\nAbout Workera\n\nWorkera is pioneering the future of skills technology, reimagining how organizations align business needs with verified skills data to future-fit their workforce and accelerate productivity and innovation.

This multi-faceted alliance includes a strategic investment by Accenture, a reseller collaboration enabling Accenture to deliver Workera's solutions to clients globally, and a technology integration establishing Workera as the official skills intelligence layer within Accenture's LearnVantage platform. Together, the companies aim to accelerate the adoption of skills-first strategies, helping organizations navigate the complexities of today's talent landscape.\n\nThe partnership comes at a pivotal time. Accenture research reveals that 61% of workers worldwide will require retraining by 2027. While 94% of employees express readiness to learn new skills, only 5% of organizations are effectively reskilling their workforce at scale. The challenge is particularly pronounced in high-demand fields like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing, where skill requirements continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace.\n\nThis collaboration builds on Accenture's April 2024 selection of Workera as a skills intelligence partner for LearnVantage, a comprehensive learning platform designed to address the rapidly shortening half-life of technical skills. Where technical expertise once remained relevant for a decade or more, many skills now require reskilling and/or upskilling within just four years\u2014and even sooner in cutting-edge areas like generative AI and machine learning.\n\n\"The rise of generative AI has amplified our clients' need for training and upskilling their people in cloud, data, and AI as they build their digital core, which is essential for reinvention,\" said Kishore Durg, global lead of Accenture LearnVantage. \"By integrating Workera into Accenture LearnVantage, we're equipping enterprises with the tools to personalize learning journeys and optimize workforce capabilities using skills intelligence data. This partnership, including our recent investment, underscores Accenture's commitment to delivering transformative value to our clients.\"\n\n\"Workera's expertise in skills intelligence, combined with Accenture's global reach and innovative solutions, will redefine how organizations approach workforce development,\" said Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of Workera. \"Together, we are advancing the skills-first movement, empowering companies to align their talent strategies with business objectives and unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation.\"\n\nTo learn more about how Workera can help you with workforce transformation initiatives in 2025, please visit www.workera.ai.\n\nAbout Workera\n\nWorkera is pioneering the future of skills technology, reimagining how organizations align business needs with verified skills data to future-fit their workforce and accelerate productivity and innovation.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-21, Accenture PLC's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $254.18. It's currently trading at a price of $352.59. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -38.72%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Accenture PLC\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Accenture PLC's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $12.28 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 11.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 124.02 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 88.92 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 254.18\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $327.23. This valuation indicates that the Accenture PLC is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -7.75%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Matt Garman\n\nA welcome realization about AI that we\u2019ve seen more of in recent months is that successful adoption is about more than technology; culture change is every bit as important - and that will mean organizations thinking again about HR and change management.\n\nOn Day One of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, two AI industry leaders, AWS and Accenture, picked up on this idea as their respective CEOs outlined their own experiences of \u2018eating their own dog food\u2019.\n\nFor AWS, CEO Matt Garman emphasized a by now familiar theme from the firm about Amazon\u2019s long experience in tapping in AI internally. This has made the current generative AI hype cycle something easier to manage in terms of winning take-up within AWS:\n\nWe were fortunate to have some of the best technology experts in the world, and so they jumped in, and in many ways, were driving a bunch of the gen AI technology. Getting that set of people to dive into the technology wasn't really that hard. It's like kids in a candy store for them, really, they're quite excited to dive in. We have some of the best science experts in the world, some of the best technology experts in the world. So, that part of our business was quite easy.\n\nBut there were other factors that needed to be taken into consideration, he recalled, with customers looking to AWS to be experts and provide advice/knowledge. This impacts on more than the techies and means that the likes of sales people on the front line need to be trained to be up to speed:\n\nFortunately, we have that expertise in-house. We\u2019re training the rest of our team all of the time to be at the leading edge of technology. We've built that muscle over the last 20 years that we've been building AWS, so whether it's new technologies across the board, we've kind of built that mechanism to do training. Our customers look to us to train them as well and so we've actually built up a whole organization that's focused on training customers. It's free training. We train millions and millions of customers for free on AI because we feel like they're not going to get the most out of technology, they're not going to get the most out of what we do, if they don't.\n\nTraining considerations\n\nAgain, the idea that successful AI adoption transcends tech comes into play, he added:\n\nIt's actually not how you use the technology. That's not actually the training. The hardest bit is getting people's heads around what's possible and, and not even what's possible now, but what's possible 24 months from now, or 48 months, or two, three, four years out. I think people have a hard enough time realizing what's possible today, but as you're implementing it 12 months later, the technology is going to be much further along, so you really have to think about what's going to be possible and unlocking it.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily as straightforward as it might sound. Garman explained:\n\nIt really is unlike any technology that we've had before. It really is going to change every single job in every single industry in ways that I think it's really hard for people heads to get around. It's not just doing something 5% better, it's doing something 1,000% better or more, that order of magnitude.\n\nAnd it all takes time on the part of AWS, he noted:\n\nWe have to sit down and help them understand how can their business actually get that much more efficient, that much more effective? How can we change customer experiences that way? So internally, we had to get our teams to think bigger like that too, and really push them to think what's possible out there. I think as soon as your employees get their heads around that it's not that my job's going away, or it's not that this is going to save us five percent of cost, but, that we're going to fundamentally be able to go deliver things weren't possible before, if you at least have the right sets of employees, most people get pretty excited about that opportunity.\n\nOne way to convey this is to \u2018show, not tell\u2019, he advised:\n\nLean into a particular use case that that takes work and toil off of the rest of your team, that unblocks something. One example we had of this is we built a product that automatically upgraded Java version, If you talk to software development teams, that is a task that not one person is super excited about doing. No one's like, \u2018You know what I really love is just upgrading Java\u2019. It's boring, but it makes sure you have all the latest security, it gives you performance benefits etc. We built an AI system called Q Developer Transform that just does that for you, and so we decided to eat our own dog food. We said, \u2018OK, we're going to go do that across Amazon\u2019. The teams internally estimated that to upgrade all of our internal systems was gonna take somewhere around 4,000+ man years to upgrade. We had a team of five people that did it in a couple of months across and so we freed up 4000 person years of effort to go build features and capabilities for all of our customers by taking away work that no-one wanted to do in the first place. It is a very good thing where you just lean in, you just say, \u2018This is a capability that we can go and roll out and and it's good\u2019. It highlights that when you find that thing, it has a massive impact on your company.\n\nRe-inventing HR\n\nAccenture CEO Julie Sweet picked up on the new role that existing HR teams need to face up to:\n\nWhat this requires is a completely different thinking about how people work and what skills they have. In most cases, AI isn't replacing people, it's replacing tasks or parts of the processes, which means that in order to upskill people, you have to understand what skills do they have to begin with? At Accenture, we moved to skill-based HR over five years ago. I have a database of almost 800,000 people and their skills. We're systematically re-defining the skills needed at Accenture - who needs gen AI, what kinds of technology? - but also, as we are replacing some of the things that they're doing with gen AI, we're able to identify who could be upskilled. So you have to have skills-based HR.\n\nEnterprises also need to have HR can adapt. Sweet cited Accenture\u2019s work in introducing AI into marketing:\n\nWe built an agent so [employees] can give feedback just like you would give feedback to someone you were supervising, or feedback to a colleague. That suddenly makes the AI very real to people, and they start to see how it can really help them.\n\nThat\u2019s important when dealing with transformative technology, he added:\n\nThat's a totally different mindset. We didn't have a playbook that says, \u2018How do we take people who are now going to use AI fundamentally in their job and make this be something that they really care about?\u2019.\n\nFinally, HR needs to get its head around the importance of change management, she advised:\n\nThe kinds of change management that you have to do here require you to understand the technology and understand the people. In most cases, companies use change management to train on a new system, or they use whatever partner they happen to be using. This is a skill set now that has to be at the center of your company, because it's a continuous re-invention. The amount of opportunity that AI is going to change in countries and companies is going to take decades. It's not a one and done. So building change management so it's not viewed as being something off on the side is really important.\n\nAll of this is vital for successful AI adoption, she concluded:\n\nAt the end of the day, the technology will only be effective if it's trusted and adopted, and you can then create new opportunities for your people. We have to think very, very differently about the incredible departments of HR, and the role that they need to play and how they have to re-invent themselves.\n\nMy take\n\nInteresting perspectives from two organizations that are both users and purveyors of AI.",

This growth is driven by more favourable market conditions, with IT companies benefiting from interest rate cuts, a rebound in corporate spending, and sustained demand for emerging technologies, notably AI.\n\nAccenture (brand value up 2% to USD41.5 billion) retains its position as the most valuable IT services brand. The brand\u2019s strong global presence, diverse service offerings, and strategic investments in AI have reinforced its dominance at the top of the ranking.\n\nAccenture has also overtaken IBM Consulting to become the strongest IT Services brand in 2025, with a brand strength index score of 89.6/100 and an equivalent AAA+ rating. Its rise in brand strength is largely driven by its exceptional familiarity and market presence, particularly in the US, where it commands the highest familiarity levels among the top 25 brands. Accenture\u2019s robust competitive position is further reflected in its top score for consideration in both Europe and the US.\n\nThe drivers of consideration encompass a range of factors that influence decision-making when evaluating companies or service providers, emphasising technical expertise, operational efficiency, and strategic alignment with client needs.\n\nLorenzo Coruzzi, Valuation Director at Brand Finance, commented,\n\n\u201cBrand Finance data reveals that \"deep expertise in AI\" is the top driver of consideration in the IT Services sector, accounting for 18% of decision making. This finding emphasises the need for companies to excel in AI innovation to stay competitive and meet the evolving demands of customers in an increasingly digital world. Accenture performs well in this metric, evidenced by securing USD3 billion in new generative AI bookings in 2024. This achievement highlights Accenture\u2019s leadership in harnessing AI to drive innovation and business growth.\u201d\n\nTCS (brand value up 11% to USD21.3 billion) retains its position as the world\u2019s second most valuable IT services brand for the fourth consecutive year. Notably, TCS is the second IT services brand to surpass the major milestone of USD20 billion in brand value, on the back of its investments in its brand and its growing prowess in AI and new technologies.\n\nA key pillar of TCS\u2019s brand-building strategy is its association with marathons and other high-profile sports events worldwide. From sponsoring iconic races like the TCS New York City Marathon and the TCS Sydney Marathon (its latest acquisition in 2024), to partnering with Jaguar TCS Racing in Formula E, TCS has cemented its global presence by using sports as a dynamic platform to connectwith diverse audiences while highlighting its transformative digital solutions.\n\nHCLTech (brand value up 17% to USD8.9 billion) has emerged as the world\u2019s fastest-growing IT Services brand in 2025. This growth is fuelled by its strong financial performance driven by a series of mega deal wins across diverse industries and geographies in 2024, the continued positive momentum of its successful brand transformation and its early leadership in AI/GenAI business. HCLTech\u2019s AI offerings have created a lot of stickiness in the market, the company having entered the space almost a decade ago and having strong AI partnerships with all the leading Technology OEMs and Hyperscalers.\n\nDavid Haigh, Chairman and CEO at Brand Finance, commented,\n\n\"HCLTech has once again exhibited exceptional growth in its brand value through effective market differentiation, becoming the fastest growing IT Services brand in the world and retaining its AAA- rating. In an era where buyers and prospective employees encounter numerous choices across various categories, HCLTech has set itself apart with its distinctive brand positioning, clearly articulating the company's ambition, energy, and momentum. This remarkable performance underscores how effectively HCLTech is engaging with clients and capitalising on new market opportunities, surpassing other leading brands in the industry.\u201d\n\nInfosys (brand value up 15% to USD16.3 billion) is recognised as the world\u2019s third most valuable IT Services brand for the fourth consecutive year. The brand has also achieved the fastest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in brand value (18%) over the last five years among IT Services brands. Bolstered by the robust leadership of CEO Salil Parekh, Infosys has redoubled its relevance in the AI-first world and consistently delivered strong performances and innovation in the rapidly evolving digital services landscape.\n\nDavid Haigh, Chairman and CEO at Brand Finance, commented,\n\n\u201cInfosys has demonstrated remarkable growth over the past five years, achieving the fastest CAGR among IT services brands. The company has strategically prioritised innovation and emerging technologies, with a strong focus on generative AI. Infosys has also consistently leveraged high-profile sponsorships and strategic partnerships, intensifying its brand visibility and market presence in recent years. This commitment to technological innovation and strategic brand positioning has not only enhanced Infosys' brand value growth but has also strengthened its brand on the global stage, reflected in an enhanced brand strength score and an impressive AAA rating.\n\nSustainability is becoming an increasingly important driver of consideration and reputation in the IT Services sector. Brand Finance data considers three sustainability-related factors that influence consideration; these encompass environmental, social, and governance aspects of sustainability. In total, sustainability is responsible for driving 17.5% of consideration of IT Services brands, up from 14.1% in 2024. Of these, the most significant driver is a company's commitment to supporting communities and wider society, followed by its dedication to being professionally, ethically, and responsibly managed.\n\nAmong the top 25 IT Services brands, Accenture has the highest Sustainability Perceptions Score, at 4.31 out of 5. Accenture scores well across environmental, social, and governance categories and has clearly communicated its commitment to ethical management and diversity.",

The JV would also build specialised AI tools to support teams to work smarter and faster, helping build data and AI fluency across Telstra\u2019s workforce, and fast-tracking the development of future-critical skills.\n\nThe proposed seven-year JV is subject to consultation with Telstra\u2019s employees and unions. Telstra\u2019s core Data & AI workforce, based in Australia and India, would receive an offer to join the JV. At the end of the seven-year term, JV employees would be offered a role at Telstra. The JV is expected to become more efficient and streamlined as the acceleration of Telstra\u2019s data and AI roadmap is delivered.\n\nTelstra CEO Vicki Brady said the JV would leverage Accenture\u2019s global expertise to scale AI responsibly and at pace, which would help Telstra deliver seamless connectivity and better experiences for customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made strong progress on our AI goals and already have hundreds of value-driving AI use-cases across the business. This includes generative AI tools built in-house, like AskTelstra and One Sentence Summary, which are helping our people support customers more effectively and efficiently,\u201d Ms Brady said.\n\n\u201cBut our data and AI ambition goes well beyond introducing AI tools. It goes to the heart of what we do \u2013 connecting Australia, and Australians to the world. From building self-healing, resilient networks, to reinventing experiences for our customers and the way we work, AI will help power an exciting, connected future.\n\n\u201cWe will get there much faster and more efficiently by collaborating in an ecosystem of likeminded global leaders, leveraging each other\u2019s strengths and accelerating innovation. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft and our joint venture with Quantium have been critical enablers in our AI journey so far, and this joint venture with Accenture will propel us into the next phase of our AI evolution.\u201d\n\nJulie Sweet, Chair and CEO, Accenture, said: \u201cWe are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention. Leading companies across the world are embracing agentic AI and generative AI to reinvent themselves using the technology and new ways of working to drive productivity and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud of our long-standing collaboration with a visionary leader like Telstra, and committed to accelerating its bold AI fuelled business strategy, which will set new standards for the telecom industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also excited about combining our experience, talent and capabilities with Telstra\u2019s to drive innovation and value for Telstra\u2019s customers, people, and shareholders today and in the future.\u201d\n\nAs part of these changes, Telstra would consolidate vendor support from 18 data and AI providers and partners down to two JVs \u2013 Quantium Telstra and the proposed joint venture with Accenture. This would drive deeper strategic partnership, shared accountability, and enable further acceleration in data and AI. It follows Telstra\u2019s Software Engineering & IT division consolidating its partners last year, which saw it move from more than 400 vendors to two strategic partners, streamlining operations, reducing complexity and delivering efficiencies.\n\nThe proposed JV would be 60 per cent owned by Accenture and 40 per cent Telstra, with Telstra retaining control over its data and AI strategy and roadmap, which the JV would help deliver.\n\nSource: BUSINESS WIRE",

            "content": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Accenture ( ) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Accenture, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$10b \u00f7 (US$60b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024).\n\nTherefore, Accenture has an ROCE of 24%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Accenture compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can for free.\n\nSo How Is Accenture's ROCE Trending?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Accenture. The company has employed 94% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 24%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If Accenture can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Accenture's ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Accenture has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation.

Our online lives have become all-encompassing. It has become a place of argument on every issue for every demographic in some way. The \u2018Comments Section\u2019 has become the modern battleground.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuelled by forums that provide anonymity and reward the promotion of extreme points of view, the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for division is created.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the bizarre language, tone and characters on these forums allowed us to write a unique campaign that struck at the heart of the issue while still being entertaining.\n\nAnd so, it\u2019s the perfect place for Aussie Lamb to step in and remind everyone that real people are behind these posts. And ultimately, the things that unite us are much more powerful than those that divide us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> How did you select the real online comments featured in the ad?\n\n\n\n\n\nTara> First, we wrote a script with indicative comments, making it topical and diverse to have universal appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then partnered with Kinesso to use monitoring technology to search the internet for specific keywords, like \u2018windfarm\u2019, \u2018AI\u2019, or \u2018flat earth\u2019. Then we filtered the results using geolocation and sentiment to ensure we had Australian comments that were both positive and negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a lot of fun to use accurate comments from real people, with real emotion, typos and sometimes a bizarre point of view. They say truth is stranger than fiction. And it was.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then trawled through thousands of related comments to find the right balance of positive and negative, weaving them together in a funny way that felt true to the online experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor OOH, we have then taken comments about the film and made them headlines to drive people to watch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What challenges did you face in reimagining these comments in a way that resonates with audiences?\n\nTara> We needed to take the fragments of copy from people\u2019s online comments and curate them to have emotion and humour without losing the context of a broader story. It was a complicated jigsaw puzzle involving writing, casting, storytelling and production. We were still assembling these different pieces well into the edit.\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Why do you think a lamb BBQ serves as a powerful metaphor for unity in Australian culture?\n\n\n\n\n\nTara> In 2015, when we first started working with MLA, we wanted to find out how Aussies felt about lamb so we went about doing an ethnographic study. It revealed that unlike chicken, beef and seafood, lamb was most often a shared experience that brought people together. Lamb also unites people across more religions and cultures than any other meat. These insights informed the brand\u2019s essence of \u2018unity\u2019 and positioning as the meat that brings Aussies together like no other meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What role did Max Barden\u2019s direction play in bringing this concept to life?\n\n\n\n\n\nTara> Max is a talented director who is innately hilarious, so much of his comedic skill went into the films. Beyond that, he brought a whole lot of energy and enthusiasm.\n\nHe made a super detailed storyboard animatic, voicing every character, which gave us both stitches and confidence that the final film would deliver.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, a project like this is constantly evolving right through until dispatch. Everyone was super collaborative throughout the production process, ensuring our story delivered on message, comedy and, importantly, the mission to make Australian Lamb the unifying hero.\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> Why was it important to include both positive and negative real comments in the OOH campaign?\n\n\n\n\n\nTara> We never judge or take sides and this year was no different.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also reflects real life, if you think about online comment sections. All sorts of views are shared, positive and negative, and everything in between, so it worked seamlessly for this idea. We needed to mirror that in our work both in the film and in OOH.\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What metrics or feedback will you use to measure the success of this campaign?\n\nTara> We talk about \u2018Eyeballs and Mouthfuls\u2019 as key measures for lamb campaigns \u2013 the more people view the campaign, the more significant the exposure. The more people talk about the campaign, the more fame lamb gets. People buying more lamb over summer and new households buying lamb for the first time are the ultimate measures of campaign success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> What was the most surprising or memorable comment you encountered during the development of the campaign?\n\n\n\n\n\nTara> On the topic of how to make the perfect cup of tea, the comment: \u201cSame as with Cereal. Milk First\u201d made us all laugh. You end up getting caught up in the debate, too. (For the record, it\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019 for me.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLBB> How do you anticipate this campaign will spark conversations among Australians?\n\nTara> Like it or not, online comments are part of the modern human experience for most of us. Everyone has experience, probably on both sides of the fence, or at least experienced the effects of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign has already got people talking about how we behave online and whether we\u2019d be different if we were at a BBQ with a lamb cutlet. Lamb campaigns always aim to sell loads of Aussie Lamb and get people talking and discussing what brings us together.",

Acknowledging the important role creative agencies play as gatekeepers of inclusion, Shift 20 has unveiled an impressive group of networked and independent partners, committed to creating work that is more inclusive and representative of disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlongside founding agency Special, a further 14 agencies including 72andSunny, Bread Agency, BMF, Cummins&Partners, TBWA, 303 MullenLowe, Today the Brave, Droga5 ANZ, part of Accenture Song, Paper Moose, Akcelo, Apparent, Dentsu, DDB and Ogilvy have committed to joining a community of best practice: helping create advertising and communications that are more inclusive; leading conversations with brands, and sharing key learnings and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group, alongside Shift 20\u2019s brand partners, will consider how they can be more inclusive of people with disability across concept development, casting, production, and digital accessibility. All agencies engaged have access to educational resources that give them the tools to challenge attitudes around disability representation and play a role in driving broader societal change, as well as ongoing access to the Shift 20 team.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgencies will also partner with Shift 20 in centrally tracking disability representation through brand and agency work, helping to quantify the impact the collective is making. Agencies will report back quarterly on key measures such as the number of productions that include talent and crew with disability, and assets with closed captions and audio descriptors; to create meaningful benchmarks for following years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPriya Addams Williams, Shift 20 Initiative lead, Dylan Alcott Foundation, said, \u201cWhilst the launch of the Shift 20 Initiative showed significant demand for higher levels of disability representation, it also highlighted the incredibly important role that agencies can play in shaping the landscape of advertising for the better. There was a huge desire from creatives, copywriters, casting agents and beyond to ensure the positive inclusion of people with disability was a conscious and considered step in the creative process; and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to continue welcoming agencies into the fold throughout the rest of the year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsey Evans, partner and CEO at Special and board director at Advertising Council Australia, said, \u201cWe feel an incredible sense of pride and gratitude to have partnered with the Dylan Alcott Foundation on the creation of the Shift 20 Initiative. From the very beginning we were sure that what we saw as an incredibly important area for development, other agencies would quickly see too. It\u2019s been a wonderful journey in the last year seeing this ethos make its way through every touchpoint of our agency with disability representation becoming a norm, not a \u2018nice to have\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Michael, CEO at Droga5 ANZ, part of Accenture Song, said, \u201cInclusive advertising reflects the true diversity of our world \u2014 vibrant, varied, and full of possibility. By partnering with Shift 20, we ensure we're staying true to this belief. We're proud to join the growing movement of agencies advocating and accountable for representation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWez Hawes, CCO at 72andSunny, said, \u200b\u200b\"I've had the pleasure of working on various productions with Dylan Alcott and seeing the Shift 20 Initiative in action on set. It really makes a tangible impact on people's lives and we feel it is a must for a modern and progressive agency like ourselves. It's one thing to say it, it's another to act.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023 the Dylan Alcott Foundation set out to shift the needle on disability representation across Australia with the launch of the Shift 20 Initiative. The initiative aimed to bring the poor rates of disability representation on-screen (1%) much closer to the 20% of Australians living with disability. The campaign launched with a collective of the country\u2019s leading brands and has seen significant success with a rise of over 10% overall recall of disability representation in advertising post launch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recently, Shift 20 also unveiled a world-first TikTok channel, Shift 20 Casting Call, for casting people with disability.\n\n\n\n",

Instead, sponsor relationships are formed through more organic connections with employees.\n\n\"99% of it is unofficial, and it's about finding people that you want to help basically,\" said Matthew Fitzpatrick, a senior partner at McKinsey and global leader of QuantumBlack Labs, the software development and R&D arm of McKinsey's AI division, QuantumBlack. Fitzpatrick has sponsored hundreds of employees during his 12-year tenure at the firm and said it's \"probably the most fun part of my job.\"\n\nHis advice to younger employees is to seek sponsors who share their interests.\n\n\"All good mentor and sponsorship relationships are built around really shared interests and passions for things,\" he said. \"I think the relationships I formed over the last decade were people that were really interested in the same things I am.\"\n\nFormer McKinsey consultants say advancing at the firm is tough without a sponsor. \"Sponsors are extremely important, especially if you are looking for your next promotion,\" an associate who left last April told Business Insider by text. \"They can certainly make your career if you have strong sponsors and a lack of a strong sponsor makes it difficult to survive.\"\n\nMany consultants work on a project-to-project basis, and sponsors can also help new hires secure projects that build their reputation within the firm.\n\n\"My first six to seven months when I was a brand new analyst at Accenture, it was just really tough to get onto high-quality projects, and I felt totally lost, even though I was assigned a career counselor,\" a former Accenture consultant, who requested anonymity to avoid jeopardizing career prospects, said.\n\nShe had a breakthrough when a senior consultant at the firm recognized her potential and put her on his next project, which offered the kind of visibility she needed to advance her career at the firm.\n\n\"Literally because of him, one good project led to another one,\" she said. \"He became my biggest advocate in terms of being not only a sponsor for promotions but also a mentor for coaching me on the day-to-day.\" Eventually, he became her direct manager, too.\n\nMany top consulting firms have various types of corporate mentorship programs, which are different from sponsors. These programs offer employees one-on-one guidance with senior-level executives. Some pair employees from different generations or demographic backgrounds.\n\nHowever, consultants say that mentorship alone can't fill the gap between success and failure at a firm.\n\nThe former Accenture consultant stayed at the firm for four years due to the support of her boss.\n\n\"Beyond the formal boss and employee relationship, he also made an extra effort to both mentor me and be my advocate,\" she said, noting that the distinction is important. \"I think that people need individuals who are in both camps.

Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nNvidia is a foundational AI company\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) deserves top billing on this list because the company's semiconductors are at the heart of nearly all AI advancements. Nvidia's GPUs have an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market and are used for everything from generative AI chatbots to autonomous vehicle driving systems.\n\nFor example, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2025 recently that AI agents, advanced chatbots that can complete tasks on their own without outside prompts, could become a \"multitrillion-dollar market\" in the coming years. Accenture, SAP, Salesforce, and other companies are already using Nvidia's hardware to develop their own agents. Nvidia says billions of these AI agents could be deployed over the next several years.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is benefiting as autonomous and semiautonomous driving systems expand. The company's autonomous vehicle DRIVE platform is used by major automakers, including Toyota, General Motors, and even Amazon's robotaxi company, Zoox. Nvidia is already earning significant revenue from its automotive segment, and Huang said recently that automotive sales will reach a $5 billion annual run rate this year.\n\nOf course, I can't leave out Nvidia's massive opportunity in AI data centers. Huang has been clear about how big he believes AI will be for this company, saying that spending for AI data centers will double over the next five years to $2 trillion. That spending will bring more AI automation, and Nvidia's leading position in semiconductors means it will continue tapping into that growth.\n\nTesla's bet on AI automation\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is another obvious major player in the rise of AI automation. The company has its hands in several key automation markets, the largest of which is likely semiautonomous vehicles.\n\nTesla's driver assistance system (called full self-driving, or FSD) isn't fully autonomous but uses sensors, cameras, and AI chips to allow drivers to hand over some driving on the highway. Some Teslas can also park on their own or leave their parking space and meet their driver in the parking lot.\n\nHowever, Tesla has much bigger plans that involve launching its own autonomous robotaxi vehicle called Cybercab. Tesla CEO Elon Musk debuted Cybercab at an event several months ago and said it could be priced around $30,000 and go on sale before 2027. The global ride-hailing market will be worth an estimated $213 billion by 2029.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla has built its own robot, called Optimus, and is ramping up production. The bots can do repetitive, unsafe, and labor-intensive tasks humans may not want to do. Tesla says it will start mass production of its Optimus robots this year and reach 50,000 to 100,000 bots by next year.\n\nCitigroup estimates that the global worldwide humanoid robot market could reach $7 trillion by 2050, with lots of potential for Tesla. Musk is seemingly well aware of the opportunity and said recently that Optimus could push Tesla's market value to $25 trillion.\n\nAI automation dominance comes at a price\n\nThere's no denying a global AI race among companies is underway. The companies listed above are making big strides in AI automation and could continue to help lead in the coming years.\n\nJust keep in mind that some of these stocks also come with hefty price tags. Tesla's shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 115, while Nvidia is cheaper with a forward P/E ratio of 32. If you're buying either, make sure you're comfortable with the premium that comes along with owning a top AI stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "(Yicai) Jan. 17 -- Generative artificial intelligence is changing daily experiences and reshaping how consumers interact with brands, with digital trust becoming increasingly important, according to the latest research report by global management consulting giant Accenture.\n\nThe acceleration of GenAI content into all places where people have traditionally discovered, socialized, and shopped online is causing trust issues and fueling hesitation, according to Accenture Life Trends 2025. GenAI's ability to facilitate hyper-personalized harm and harassment, deepfakes, and scams has also become a serious problem.\n\nThe Accenture Life Trends 2025 reveals shifting consumer behaviors and trust patterns. It is based on interviews with designers, sociologists, technologists, and anthropologists from over 50 global design studios and creative agencies and an online survey of 24,295 people across 22 markets.\n\nThe report highlights that consumer hesitation affects search, sharing, shopping, and social behaviors.\n\n\"As human-technology relationships grow more complex, trust and humanity become paramount as enterprises adopt new technologies to drive business growth and user engagement,\" Christine Wang, managing director at Accenture Song Lead China, told Yicai.\n\nChinese consumers show less skepticism toward online content than globally, with 36 percent of them questioning authenticity and 38 percent doubting news credibility, versus the global 47 percent and 49 percent, respectively, said Deng Ling, senior researcher at Accenture Research. However, 38 percent of Chinese respondents find online shopping chaotic, higher than the global average of 25 percent.\n\nBrands should maintain long-term perspectives, build trustworthy and exclusive content, and leverage social listening tools to monitor and remove false information while establishing emotional connections with consumers, Wang suggested.\n\nChinese consumers have distinct characteristics, as 77 percent prefer quick solutions, compared to the 55 percent global average. In addition, 43 percent of them regularly watch movies or listen to podcasts at faster speeds, compared to only 31 percent globally.\n\nChinese consumers are also more engaged with social media, as 41 percent share problem-solving videos online, versus 23 percent globally. The survey also shows that 70 percent of Chinese seek lifestyle inspiration from short-video site Douyin, placing it above family and friends as an information source.\n\n\"Brands should evolve from content providers to content accelerators\" by tapping consumers' tendency to seek shortcuts and cultivating user habits, Wang said. For example, fitness app Keep promotes a daily habit challenge to encourage users to build fitness routines, and language-learning platform Duolingo motivates users with its consecutive days feature.\n\nThe report also indicates a growing desire for meaningful offline experiences, with 49 percent of Chinese respondents choosing offline activities for health benefits. More than half of them opt for a combination of physical and digital experiences.\n\nWang suggested brands take advantage of consumers' eagerness to share by building communities, creating social healing spaces, and developing omnichannel interactions to meet both emotional and practical consumer needs in this rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nEditor: Futura Costaglione",

At the end of the seven-year term, JV employees would be offered a role at Telstra.\n\nTelstra would consolidate vendor support from 18 data and AI providers and partners down to two JVs - Quantum Telstra and the proposed joint venture with Accenture. The proposed JV would be 60 per cent owned by Accenture and 40 per cent Telstra, with Telstra retaining control over its data and AI strategy and roadmap.",

            "content": "Ron Ash is not tasked with a turnaround job or leading a wholesale change of Accenture's U.S. federal subsidiary as its new chief executive.\n\nAsh is following the seven-year tenure of John Goodman, who led Accenture Federal Services through a period of growth and wins of positions at all Cabinet-level agencies.\n\nInstead, Ash will lead AFS into the second Trump administration and an era that many see as potentially being transformative with a focus on modernization and efficiency across government.\n\nHe worked as chief operating officer at AFS for two years before he became CEO on Sept. 1.\n\nAsh sees three areas as ripe for disruption early in the Trump administration \u2013 legacy systems modernization, call centers and the roll out of agentic AI, an artificial intelligence tool that enables automation.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we are doing is sitting down with our account teams to prepare their value stories but also plan the future of their programs,\u201d Ash told us. \u201cThis administration is going to come in with technical experts and it's critically important to make sure our clients are ready for those conversations.\u201d\n\nAsh said agencies will need to be able to explain the technical side of their operations, such as which cloud they picked and the native services they are using, but also the value they are delivering to the mission.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple programs that by this summer are going to eliminate mainframes and move to the cloud,\u201d Ash said. \u201cThat's right in the wheelhouse of what the administration wants to see. But absent data, they might not know that. We have to give our customers, the data so they can defend their programs and support their missions.\u201d\n\nGiven the Trump administration\u2019s focus on modernization and efficiency, Ash said he expects a wave of activity there over the next year.\n\n\u201cThis will significantly change the way the government serves its mission,\u201d he said.\n\nAsh said he is pushing his teams to bring customers solutions that can generate a return on investment within 12-to 18 months. That approach is common in Accenture\u2019s commercial business.\n\n\u201cWe have to have that same mindset. We need to be able to pay that money back with what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Ash said.\n\nHe expects opportunities around eliminating technical debt such as moving customers off of mainframe computers and onto the cloud.\n\nFor an unnamed customer, Ash said AFS is moving a system off a mainframe using the Assembler language and onto a more modern platform. They created a generative AI tool called GenWizard for the code translation.\n\n\u201cThink about all the legacy systems that are out there and being able to quickly modernize them and get them onto the cloud and the generative AI and agentic AI wave can happen,\u201d he said.\n\nAsh said that call centers are among the low hanging fruit of the coming wave modernization. That is where he expects to see early use of agentic AI, a technique that applies artificial intelligence to enable more automation.\n\n\u201cCall centers are probably the easiest place to bring that in because you have decades of data that you can read into your models,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Education Department\u2019s Federal Student Aid office, AFS integrated 13 legacy websites into a single platform by using cloud, AI and automation. It also includes an virtual assistant called Aidan that can answer questions and conduct transactions.\n\n\u201cThink about the amount of time that can save not just for citizens but for the department as well,\u201d Ash said.\n\nAidan, an agentic AI tool, is also constantly learning and being trained.\n\n\u201cWe keep adding skills to Aidan and think we should be able to get up to 90% of all inbound calls being handled by Aidan,\u201d he said.\n\nAccenture is also using agentic AI internally to automate more of its back-office systems.\n\n\u201cBringing our experiences really helps differentiate how we go to market,\u201d he said.\n\nFor agentic AI to gain momentum, agencies need to decouple their organizations so they can move horizontally to solve problems. The next step would be AI agents working with other AI agents across agencies.\n\nA key requirement for making this happen is that agencies need to continue restructuring their data.\n\n\u201cGetting your digital core strong is the most important thing to happen right now,\u201d Ash said. \u201cThat means structuring your data in a way that tools can access it and understand what the data is and have context.\u201d\n\nAFS has gathered many of its ideas on how to modernize the government into a new report, A Federal Leader\u2019s Guide to Reinvention. AFS' approach to the market and the opportunities would be the same regardless of what new administration came in, he said.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s tied more to the moment we are in technologically, but what\u2019s great about what\u2019s happening with the administration is that they\u2019re on board too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government wants to do this too and the administration appears to be very focused on making it happen.\u201d",

Just off the show floor at The Venetian Expo, the company\u2019s branded lounge was about what\u2019s next and how it translates to now.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with JLR, one activity in Accenture\u2019s space showcased the use of advanced generative AI and real-time graphics capabilities to create a luxury vehicle-purchasing experience, such as with Defender. Another activity focused on the role of AI in production, with factories and warehouses taking automation to the next level. This area featured a robotic arm and humanoid robot named Digits in the Next Gen Warehouse setting.\n\nWhile the other two scenarios created compelling cases for business leaders, the activation that probably hit the most on raw emotion was centered around Security and AI. Guests could step into a phone booth and experience one of the scary sides of AI\u2014a deepfake of themselves generated in seconds using just their picture and their voice sample. Seeing yourself in a completely fake\u2014and disturbing\u2014scenario was as unnerving as it was motivational. Created in partnership with First AI ID Kit, the activation made the threat of external risk feel extremely personal, priming the conversation for the company\u2019s security solutions.\n\n\u201cFrom Accenture\u2019s perspective, we want to ensure that [our presence] shows both the ambition for tomorrow from the perspective of the needs that our clients have today,\u201d said Accenture\u2019s spokesperson.\n\nThis thought process led to the brand reinventing the space for this year\u2019s CES and anchoring it in business goals, with emotions still playing a key role. \u201cIn the past, the activation has been experiential,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019d take the themes and bring them to life through the use of technology. This year, we took a deliberate approach to align it to our business priorities and mapped our presence to deliver that.\u201d\n\nAlong with business-focused engagement, the area offered a place of respite from the busy show floor. A new soundproof meeting room hosted press events and presentations for larger groups. Flexible seating arrangements offered a variety of comfortable configurations for conversations that furthered business goals but also built on a key emotion, trust.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250115057058/en/\n\nJulie Sweet , Chair and CEO, Accenture and Vicki Brady , CEO, Telstra (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nSteered by joint global leadership, the JV would comprise specialists from Telstra and Accenture\u2019s Data & AI teams to build on Telstra\u2019s work creating a world-class data and AI ecosystem, modernising its data and AI platforms, and embedding responsible AI by design.\n\nAs part of the JV, Telstra would benefit from Accenture\u2019s $3 billion AI investment in assets, industry solutions, ventures, acquisitions, talent and ecosystem partnerships, with access to the latest innovation in AI technologies and AI teams in Silicon Valley .\n\nA key focus of the JV would be to reinvent business processes through new capabilities like agentic AI, enabling teams to work with intelligent AI ecosystems to optimise key tasks end-to-end. The JV would also build specialised AI tools to support teams to work smarter and faster, helping build data and AI fluency across Telstra\u2019s workforce, and fast-tracking the development of future-critical skills.\n\nThe proposed seven-year JV is subject to consultation with Telstra\u2019s employees and unions. Telstra\u2019s core Data & AI workforce, based in Australia and India , would receive an offer to join the JV. At the end of the seven-year term, JV employees would be offered a role at Telstra. The JV is expected to become more efficient and streamlined as the acceleration of Telstra\u2019s data and AI roadmap is delivered.\n\nTelstra CEO Vicki Brady said the JV would leverage Accenture\u2019s global expertise to scale AI responsibly and at pace, which would help Telstra deliver seamless connectivity and better experiences for customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made strong progress on our AI goals and already have hundreds of value-driving AI use-cases across the business. This includes generative AI tools built in-house, like AskTelstra and One Sentence Summary, which are helping our people support customers more effectively and efficiently,\u201d Ms Brady said.\n\n\u201cBut our data and AI ambition goes well beyond introducing AI tools. It goes to the heart of what we do \u2013 connecting Australia , and Australians to the world. From building self-healing, resilient networks, to reinventing experiences for our customers and the way we work, AI will help power an exciting, connected future.\n\n\u201cWe will get there much faster and more efficiently by collaborating in an ecosystem of likeminded global leaders, leveraging each other's strengths and accelerating innovation. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft and our joint venture with Quantium have been critical enablers in our AI journey so far, and this joint venture with Accenture will propel us into the next phase of our AI evolution.\u201d\n\nJulie Sweet , Chair and CEO, Accenture, said: \u201cWe are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention. Leading companies across the world are embracing agentic AI and generative AI to reinvent themselves using the technology and new ways of working to drive productivity and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud of our long-standing collaboration with a visionary leader like Telstra, and committed to accelerating its bold AI fuelled business strategy, which will set new standards for the telecom industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also excited about combining our experience, talent and capabilities with Telstra\u2019s to drive innovation and value for Telstra\u2019s customers, people, and shareholders today and in the future.\u201d\n\nAs part of these changes, Telstra would consolidate vendor support from 18 data and AI providers and partners down to two JVs - Quantium Telstra and the proposed joint venture with Accenture. This would drive deeper strategic partnership, shared accountability, and enable further acceleration in data and AI. It follows Telstra\u2019s Software Engineering & IT division consolidating its partners last year, which saw it move from more than 400 vendors to two strategic partners, streamlining operations, reducing complexity and delivering efficiencies.\n\nThe proposed JV would be 60 per cent owned by Accenture and 40 per cent Telstra, with Telstra retaining control over its data and AI strategy and roadmap, which the JV would help deliver.\n\nAbout Accenture\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company that helps the world\u2019s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services - creating tangible value at speed and scale.

            "content": "This article is part of \"Workforce Innovation,\" a series exploring the forces shaping enterprise transformation.\n\n2024 was a year of major transformations in the workforce: the surge in AI adoption, shifts in the makeup of the C-suite, and new approaches to worker well-being and DEI initiatives.\n\nFor the final roundtable of Business Insider's Workforce Innovation series, Rebecca Knight, a contributing reporter for BI, asked board members to predict the most important changes for the workforce in 2025.\n\nIn their predictions, participants highlighted the advancement of AI agents and search results as well as the importance of learning opportunities to help employees keep up with new technology.\n\nThey also discussed the trend toward skills-focused hiring and talent management \u2014 but they also emphasized the challenges of executing it.\n\n\"I think there can be a difference between larger organizations that have been focused on this for a while versus midsize and smaller companies that perhaps are just starting that journey,\" said Purvi Tailor, the vice president of human resources at Ferring Pharmaceuticals USA.\n\nJack Azagury, the group chief executive for consulting at Accenture, shared his company's experience implementing skills-based HR during the pandemic, when it had to retrain more than 100,000 employees on cloud technology.\n\n\"We've been on the journey for about 10 years on skills-based HR,\" he said. \"It took a while to get it right.\"\n\nThe roundtable participants were:\n\nAnant Adya, executive vice president, service offering head, and head of Americas delivery, Infosys\n\nJack Azagury, group chief executive for consulting, Accenture\n\nLucrecia Borgonovo, chief talent and organizational effectiveness officer, Mastercard\n\nKenon Chen, executive vice president of strategy and growth, Clear Capital\n\nMaggie Hulce, chief revenue officer, Indeed\n\nShane Koller, senior vice president and chief people officer, Ancestry\n\nJustina Nixon-Saintil, vice president and chief impact officer, IBM\n\nMarjorie Powell, chief HR officer and senior vice president, AARP\n\nPurvi Tailor, vice president of human resources, Ferring Pharmaceuticals USA\n\nSharawn Tipton, chief people and culture officer, LiveRamp\n\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRebecca Knight: What do you predict will be the single most important change in the workforce in 2025? And what advice do you have for business leaders to prepare themselves for that change?\n\nAI search, workflows, and ethics\n\nKenon Chen: I've been thinking about this a lot, and I think it'll have a really large impact, which is the idea of an AI-first search. This is where the search funnel is providing direct answers as opposed to just a ranked set of results. I think of it as summary-before-source results.\n\nThere are a number of companies looking at adopting this technology in-house as a way of modernizing the knowledge base and providing employees with direct searchable information to do their jobs.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt really changes the historical barriers to accessing subject-matter expertise within a company. To access someone who used to be the owner of that data or the one who knew the most about that subject, you had to engage their time. In this new world, you can bypass all of that and get an answer. But it might not be the most accurate answer.\n\nIf it's leveraged well, I think companies can actually have a really strong competitive advantage, because making data more available to employees can help people have shared goals and derive their value from achieving that shared goal together as opposed to just managing data currency.\n\nKenon Chen. Clear Capital Show less Justina Nixon-Saintil. IBM Show less Maggie Hulce. Indeed Show less\n\nJustina Nixon-Saintil: There's been a lot of talk about AI agents. I think there are two areas that companies have to really focus on for 2025. One is how do you balance innovation versus executing some of these AI systems in the most responsible way? And I think both of them are tied to ethical AI and skills building. Focusing on upskilling your employees and making sure you have a skilled talent pipeline in AI will be critical for employers this year.\n\nThe second thing is the ethical responsibilities that companies have. When you're providing a prompt for a system to execute something, you really have to consider the implications of that. What are the types of guardrails that you have to put in place to be able to use AI agents effectively and also safeguard your company?\n\nMaggie Hulce: There are incremental projects in particular functions that are using AI to make workflows better. Then there are the reimagination projects of how should this customer journey be radically different if AI can drive all of these steps? And it cuts across many people's ownership lines and teams.\n\nOrganizationally, how do you make sure there's a group of people set up and empowered to say, \"I can think about problems that would shake up a lot of things with a clean sheet of paper\"? I think if we leave it for each function to sort out when it's that loaded across functions, it's too challenging.\n\nCulturally, how do we reward innovation and adaptability and let people embrace change? How do you reward and reinforce a culture that says: \"You figured out how we could do this translation thing totally differently. Don't worry that we need to retrain the manual translation team; we will retrain them. Think about what can and should be changed with AI.\"\n\nLifelong learning and upskilling\n\nMarjorie Powell: The workforce is continually being driven by the aging of the population and the growing prominence of older workers.\n\nIn 2024, you saw more people over 65 choosing to stay in the workforce than ever before, partly because of the rising cost of living and concerns about retirement security. So employers are going to have to adapt by creating age-inclusive workplaces. They're going to have to harness the experience and the skills of older workers.\n\nThis is also going to mean that we have to rethink traditional career trajectories and offer flexible work arrangements. We're going to have to invest in lifelong learning opportunities for older workers, keep them engaged, and keep them invested in the workplace.\n\nMarjorie Powell. AARP Show less Shane Koller. Ancestry Show less\n\nShane Koller: This is a key area where the HR function can and should influence companies going forward. What I see in the workforce, even with employees who are relatively tech-savvy, is that it feels like they're stuck right now on what next step they need to take to be along with the ride versus being left behind. This is where we as a function have to really get out of neutral and help the workforce understand what those next steps are.\n\nRelated stories\n\nNixon-Saintil: Lifelong learning doesn't just end with AI. You have to consider the acceleration of technology. How do we make sure people understand that every new wave of technology will demand new skills and that lifelong learners will thrive? This has to be a complete mindset change for employees and employers from an investment perspective.\n\nThe other thing, just with my social-responsibility hat on, is how do we make sure we're investing in populations and providing them with access to free skilling, mentors, and real learning experiences so that they can be prepared? How do we build that talent pipeline?\n\nThat's something we are doing through programs like IBM SkillsBuild. But it's overall something that every company needs to consider \u2014 not just investing in your employees but looking at universities, K-12 systems, and partnerships with nonprofit organizations that focus on marginalized groups and provide free access to these new skills and technologies.\n\nSkills-based talent management\n\nAnant Adya: I'm a big believer that skills are more important than the four-year college degrees that everybody runs after. We recruit a lot from underrepresented communities and communities in general where we do not look for degrees.\n\nIn fact, we are going to announce some sort of target for ourselves where we say that X percentage of our population is going to come from skills and not from four-year degrees.\n\nAnant Adya. Infosys Cobalt Show less Sharawn Tipton. LiveRamp Show less\n\nSharawn Tipton: I also see skills-based talent management as one of the biggest trends for 2025. We talk a lot about experience and what people have in their tool kits, but it's really about skill and learning agility, because the technology is moving so quickly that you have to work in a different way.\n\nJack Azagury: Skills-based HR is a very complex area. The first pointer I'd give is to start in one place, not the entire enterprise, and pilot and get the algorithms. It took us years to get the right algorithm to determine what skills somebody had.\n\nThe second is to be very transparent about how you're measuring skills. For example, our algorithm says you need to have worked on this type of job for this amount of months, and that job cannot be more than six months old.\n\nThe third thing I would say is do not use skills-based HR for cost reduction.\n\nThe fourth is employees need to see how you're going to use skills-based HR \u2014 how you're going to give people new opportunities, training, and development. They need to see the positive coming out for their careers in your organization.\n\nJack Azagury. Accenture Show less Lucrecia Borgonovo. Mastercard Show less\n\nLucrecia Borgonovo: The biggest change is definitely going to be around skills-powered organizations. We know that there's not necessarily a playbook and we have to cocreate this playbook together. I think this requires pretty significant change management in addition to tech enablement.\n\nWhat we say to our leaders at Mastercard is to make sure that you're taking on a much more enterprise-wide versus siloed approach when you think about talent and skills.\n\nFrom an employee standpoint, we were talking about learning agility as a huge currency. You want to have employees who are curious, open, and adaptable and who could be much more fundable in this incredibly changing workplace.\n\nChen: The best way to prepare for change and transformation is to ensure your fundamentals are in place. There's a reason sports teams, musicians, and other folks who are trying to master a new skill often go back to make sure their fundamentals are really solid so they have a foundation to build upon for something new.\n\nI've been thinking about that a lot for AI and skills-based HR. If the basics \u2014 things like transparency, communication, shared mission, purpose, and culture \u2014 aren't in place, it's really difficult to engage in a radical transformation. The speed all this is moving at is so rapid that it's impossible to predict exactly how this might play out. But if the fundamentals are in place, you can weather those unknowns.",

The JV is expected to become more efficient and streamlined as the acceleration of Telstra\u2019s data and AI roadmap is delivered.\n\nTelstra CEO Vicki Brady said the JV would leverage Accenture\u2019s global expertise to scale AI responsibly and at pace, which would help Telstra deliver seamless connectivity and better experiences for customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made strong progress on our AI goals and already have hundreds of value-driving AI use-cases across the business. This includes generative AI tools built in-house, like AskTelstra and One Sentence Summary, which are helping our people support customers more effectively and efficiently,\u201d Ms Brady said.\n\n\u201cBut our data and AI ambition goes well beyond introducing AI tools. It goes to the heart of what we do \u2013 connecting Australia, and Australians to the world. From building self-healing, resilient networks, to reinventing experiences for our customers and the way we work, AI will help power an exciting, connected future.\n\n\u201cWe will get there much faster and more efficiently by collaborating in an ecosystem of likeminded global leaders, leveraging each other's strengths and accelerating innovation. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft and our joint venture with Quantium have been critical enablers in our AI journey so far, and this joint venture with Accenture will propel us into the next phase of our AI evolution.\u201d\n\nJulie Sweet, Chair and CEO, Accenture, said: \u201cWe are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention. Leading companies across the world are embracing agentic AI and generative AI to reinvent themselves using the technology and new ways of working to drive productivity and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud of our long-standing collaboration with a visionary leader like Telstra, and committed to accelerating its bold AI fuelled business strategy, which will set new standards for the telecom industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also excited about combining our experience, talent and capabilities with Telstra\u2019s to drive innovation and value for Telstra\u2019s customers, people, and shareholders today and in the future.\u201d\n\nAs part of these changes, Telstra would consolidate vendor support from 18 data and AI providers and partners down to two JVs - Quantium Telstra and the proposed joint venture with Accenture. This would drive deeper strategic partnership, shared accountability, and enable further acceleration in data and AI. It follows Telstra\u2019s Software Engineering & IT division consolidating its partners last year, which saw it move from more than 400 vendors to two strategic partners, streamlining operations, reducing complexity and delivering efficiencies.\n\nThe proposed JV would be 60 per cent owned by Accenture and 40 per cent Telstra, with Telstra retaining control over its data and AI strategy and roadmap, which the JV would help deliver.\n\n\n\nAbout Accenture\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company that helps the world\u2019s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services - creating tangible value at speed and scale.

Accenture noted only that the JV will benefit from its ongoing investments in its Data & AI practice.\n\nThose local reports also suggest the likelihood of job losses as a result of the JV\u2019s formation: Telstra has already been slimming down in recent months following its decision in May 2024 to axe 10% of its workforce.\n\nIn the official announcement about the JV, Accenture noted that \u201cTelstra\u2019s core Data & AI workforce, based in Australia and India, would receive an offer to join the JV. At the end of the seven-year term, JV employees would be offered a role at Telstra.

This would drive deeper strategic partnership, shared accountability, and enable further acceleration in data and AI,\u201d noted the partners.\n\nThat vendor consolidation process matches that made by Telstra\u2019s Software Engineering & IT division, which last year moved from dealing with 400 vendors to engaging with just two strategic partners \u2013 Cognizant and Infosys \u2013 a move that streamlined operations and delivered greater efficiencies.\n\n- Ray Le Maistre, Editorial Director, TelecomTV",

The machine will be used to study proteins so as to help develop treatments for cancer and other diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, the same technology is already being used in chemistry to help accelerate the development of new medicines.\n\nPFAS Detection & Eradication\n\nThe second area to benefit from quantum computing involves the detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Garris believes the technology can help with the development of a method to remove such substances from the environment. PFAS are known to pose serious environmental and health issues.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nThe third area to benefit from quantum computing is artificial intelligence. Garris foresees the development of faster and more complex AI models, which, in turn, could be advantageous in other sectors, such as in the world of finance or in autonomous vehicles and other applications that rely on sensor data to make quick decisions.",

But a new report says the new logos and badges also proved highly contentious among those working inside Jaguar.\n\nAutocar India claims to have seen a leaked letter from Jaguar\u2019s internal design team complaining to the company\u2019s chief creative officer about the rebranding project. It reveals that designers were not happy with Jag\u2019s decisions to outsource the branding work to an external agency, or what that agency came up with.\n\nRelated: In Wake Of Controversial Campaign, Jaguar Boss Said They Had To Shake Things Up\n\n\u201cWe felt that the logo disconnects from the narrative and the visual identity of the Panthera products,\u201d the Jaguar designers wrote in a letter signed by up to 30 members of the team and handed to McGovern more than two years before the new logos were publicly unveiled.\n\n\u201cOn product, it feels too rounded and playful, which does not speak to us the feeling of \u2018Exuberance\u2019.

Given that creativity naturally involves a level of subjectivity, our priority is to foster an environment that nurtures the growth of these creative ideas. As we navigate this significant transformation, we naturally engage in numerous discussions and debates to refine and evolve our thinking.

Among these announcements is the release of the Technology Vision 2025 research report, which highlighted AI and autonomy as key areas of development this year.\n\nAccording to the report, leaders in 2025 should \u201cprepare for an imminent world in which AI is everywhere and acting autonomously on behalf of people.\u201d It states that opportunities will be lost unless business leaders in the space secure enough trust from employees and consumers to engage with AI\u2019s unprecedented capabilities.\n\n\u201cOur 25th Technology Vision gives leaders a look into what\u2019s ahead when AI continuously learns, acts autonomously with and on behalf of people, and pushes enterprises and the people who use it into new and exciting ways to continuously reinvent,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. \u201cBut unlocking the benefits of AI will only be possible if leaders seize the opportunity to inject and develop trust in its performance and outcomes in a systematic manner so businesses and people can unlock AI\u2019s incredible possibilities.\u201d\n\nFour emerging AI trends\n\nThe Technology Vision 2025 report dives into what happens when AI acts autonomously at the center of enterprise technology, speaks on behalf of your brand, inhabits robotic bodies, and collaborates on behalf of your employees.\n\nWhen AI expands exponentially\n\nAmong the four emerging trends of AI that the report highlights is how GenAI transforms applications; as they become more central to enterprise IT, development costs decrease and digital agents gain autonomy.\n\nAccording to the research, 77 percent of executives surveyed agreed that AI agents will reinvent how their organizations build digital systems and 78 percent of them agree that digital ecosystems will need to be built for AI agents as much as for humans over the next three to five years.\n\nProtecting brand voice in the AI age\n\nWhile AI agents can personalize customer interactions at scale, protecting your unique brand voice is critical to avoid messaging and interactions becoming generic. If an organization increasingly utilizes third-party chat platforms and agents, it runs the risk of losing the uniqueness of its brand voice as these third-party platforms are often designed to be generic-sounding.\n\nAccenture maintains that they\u2019re not calling for enterprises to turn away from autonomy or AI in customer experience, but rather to use personified AI to marry AI\u2019s scale and efficiency with the humanizing power of a company\u2019s brand and values.\n\n\u201cCompanies that successfully introduce AI with personalities are looking at a technology that can build relationships with customers and meet their needs at an unprecedented scale,\u201d the survey states. \u201cThey\u2019re taking personified brand, and personified AI, and they\u2019re inventing the personified business.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey results, 80 percent of executives agreed that chatbots that all sound the same are creating differentiation challenges for organizations like their own. Additionally, 95 percent of executives report establishing or maintaining a consistent personality will be important or very important to their customer-facing AI agents over the next three years.\n\nIt\u2019s all about preserving trust and it is critical to keep chatbots aligned with your brand through meticulously reviewing and continuously monitoring their training data.\n\nFoundation models are reinventing robotics\n\nAmong the other emerging AI trends include large-language models (LLMs) giving robots more autonomy in the physical world, allowing them to better understand the physics of their environments, have spatial awareness, interact with people, and understand complex instructions.\n\nFoundation models have unlocked a new chapter in robotics which has reduced limitations on robots that relegated them to factories and warehouses. Generalist robotics software, adaptable to various tasks and environments, is driving new interest in multi-purpose robot hardware.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to start building your robotic future,\u201d the report states. \u201cAs robots with generalist brains and bodies learn to navigate new environments, connect with people in them, and \u2018think\u2019 through problems autonomously, their reach and impact will vastly and rapidly expand. Robots are about to go places they have never gone before, and it\u2019s up to you to reimagine your business for this new world.\n\nExecutives surveyed (74 percent) agreed that their organization sees the promise of adaptable and intelligent robots.\n\nGrowing the autonomy of people and AI\n\nDistrust around GenAI is holding back its adoption, along with its potential, and the solution\u2013 according to this survey\u2013 lies within GenAI\u2019s accessibility.\n\n\u201c[GenAI\u2019s] rapidly becoming ubiquitous, enabling leaders to enhance jobs and ignite innovation from the ground up,\u201d the report states. \u201cUnlike traditional top-down automation, GenAI can foster a dynamic interplay between workers and AI. By pivoting from mere automation to fostering autonomy, and equipping employees to steer their own AI initiatives, leaders can transform every employee into an innovator.\u201d\n\nBy shifting from automation to autonomy, organizations can unlock new skills and boost engagement, while also fueling innovation. Through the distribution of AI and the empowerment of employees with autonomy, enterprises can gain exponential innovation and growth.\n\nPart of this is upskilling employees to utilize GenAI tools. According to the report, 68 percent of executives said there\u2019s a need for upskilling or reskilling their employees, including those with disabilities, in GenAI tools within the next three years.\n\nAdditionally, 95 percent said that they expect tasks their employees perform will moderately or significantly shift to innovation over the next three years with the influx of automation enabled by GenAI.\n\nTo utilize the full power of GenAI, organizations must prioritize employee buy-in and engage their workforce in planning, clearly communicate innovation goals and long-term vision, and address concerns about job automation.\n\n\u201cAdvancements in digitizing knowledge, new AI models, agentic AI systems and architecture enables enterprises to create their own unique cognitive digital brains,\u201d said Karthik Narain, group chief executive \u2013 Technology and CTO at Accenture. \u201cWhile conventional technologies have long supported pre-determined business needs, this is a generational moment of transition. The autonomy created by these generalized AI systems can help organizations be more dynamic and intention-driven than ever. It will allow leaders to rethink how digital systems are designed, how people work, and reinvent how they create products and interact with customers. But trust underpins it all, as systems will only ever be as autonomous as they are trustworthy.\u201d\n\nAccenture has made several major announcements for the AI space, including the launch of an AI refinery for agentic AI.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other companies that just upgraded.\n\nThe last week was full of negativity as the S&P went down nearly 3.5%. Matters were made worse by raging wildfires in Los Angeles, which have shocked people across the country. Amidst all this, there were a lot of positive developments as analysts continued to point out companies poised for a great performance in 2025.\n\nArtificial Intelligence stocks continue to dominate coverage despite the fear of a slowdown in spending. With agentic AI the new hype, many companies are only just entering their AI journey, so investors still have a lot of undervalued plays that are worth looking at.\n\nTo come up with the list of 10 companies that analysts just upgraded, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion.\n\nAccenture plc (ACN) Reports Strong Q1 Growth and Increased AI Bookings, Price Target Raised to $428 by Mizuho\n\nA team of data experts gathered around a computer monitor analyzing customer data.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a consulting company operating globally. It serves various sectors including communications, media and technology, health and public service; retail, consumer goods, banking and capital markets, natural resources, energy, and utilities.

Wolfe Research\u2019s Analysts believed that discretionary demand is likely to improve going forward. Political stability and interest rate cuts could help improve the government\u2019s budgets, ultimately benefitting service providers like Accenture.\n\nThe company\u2019s investment in GenAI can help gain market share as client demand for GenAI grows. As more companies move towards implementing AI to streamline their business operations, ACN is set to benefit.\n\nOverall ACN ranks 2nd on our list of the companies that just upgraded by analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As part of the government\u2019s Industrial Strategy, this initiative underscores a commitment to digital transformation, with further details to be revealed in the upcoming Digital and Technology Sector Plan.\n\nThis comprehensive strategy underscores the UK\u2019s ambition to lead AI innovation globally, fostering economic growth and securing its place as a change-maker in the industry.\n\nLeanne Allen, head of AI at KPMG in the UK, commented: \u201cThese steps signal a strong commitment by the government to not just support but actively enhance the AI ecosystem. Enabling the expansion of data centre capabilities represents a unique opportunity for the UK to differentiate itself and drive growth, positioning us as a hub for AI development and application.\n\nAt the same time, Allen warned that while it is important the UK retains its global leadership role in AI, \u201cthe government will need to balance the expansion of these capabilities with their net-zero commitments.\u201d\n\nAlison Kay, VP UKI at Amazon Web Services (AWS), also acknowledged the UK Government\u2019s AI Opportunities Action Plan will play an important role in helping the UK to unlock the full potential of AI.\n\n\u201cAt AWS, we\u2019ve seen first-hand the benefits that digital technologies like AI can bring and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve announced plans to invest \u00a38bn over the next five years building, operating and maintaining data centers in the UK.\n\n\u201cBy putting close industry collaboration and public-private partnership at the heart of the Government\u2019s agenda, every citizen, community and business in every region of the UK will have the opportunity to realize the benefits of AI, and thrive and grow.\u201d\n\nZahra Bahrololoumi, CEO of Salesforce UKI, said: \u201cIn the coming year we will see more and more businesses embrace innovative solutions such as agentic AI to tackle everyday tasks, but they need investment and expert guidance to unleash long-term value and productivity gains.\n\n\u201cBusinesses in the UK are in a prime position to fully unlock the opportunities of AI, thanks to a strong innovation culture and risk-based laws. That is why Salesforce chose the UK as the location of its first-ever AI Centre, building on our commitment to invest $4bn in our UK operations to harness the transformational power of AI.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for ERP insiders?\n\nThe UK government has launched a bold initiative to position the nation as a global leader in AI. Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s endorsement of all 50 recommendations in the AI Opportunities Action Plan reflects a commitment to harnessing AI for productivity, economic growth and public service transformation.\n\nKey AI Development Pillars:\n\n\n\nAI Growth Zones: Streamlined planning for AI infrastructure, beginning in Culham, Oxfordshire.\n\nNational Data Library: A secure platform to leverage public data for innovation.\n\nAI Energy Council: Addressing the energy needs of AI technologies while supporting clean energy goals.\n\nIncreased Public Computing Capacity: Plans to expand computing power twentyfold, with immediate work on a new supercomputer.\n\nSovereign Capabilities Team: A dedicated group to strengthen the UK\u2019s independent AI capabilities.\n\nEconomic and Societal Benefits: The plan emphasizes job creation, reduced administrative burdens for public servants, and better public services. The reskilling of 20 million workers to adapt to AI-driven roles underscores a forward-looking approach to workforce transformation.\n\nIndustry Collaboration: Significant private-sector partnerships, such as AWS\u2019s \u00a38 billion investment over five years, signal the critical role of public-private cooperation in achieving AI leadership.\n\n\n\nThe UK\u2019s strategy aims to combine robust AI infrastructure development, workforce upskilling and sustainable innovation to drive a decade of national renewal. While challenges, such as balancing AI advancements with net-zero commitments, remain, the government\u2019s proactive approach has set the stage for transformative growth.",

The projected value of the contract is \u00a31.2bn.\n\nThe Digital Capability for Health framework 2 is a single lot, which includes five service provisions within it:\n\nDevelopment and operations (DevOps) \u2013 for ongoing minor improvements of live services Digital definition services \u2013 creating and progressing the project through discovery and alpha phases Build and transition services \u2013 building the services using beta and live phases End-to-end development services \u2013 designing and developing the services from discovery to live phases Data management (and similar) services \u2013 for performing data collection, data processing and analysis and management data and services\n\nThe companies on the new version of the framework are Accenture, Aire Logic, Atos IT Services, Birlasoft (UK), BJSS, Burendo, Capgmemini, Caution Your Blast, Cognizant Worldwide, Ernst & Young, Hippo Digital, IBM UK, Informed Solutions, Kainos Software, Mastek (UK), Netcompany, Opencast Software Europe, Pricewaterhousecoopers, CACI, Scott Logic, Softwire Technology and Thoughtworks.\n\nThis second version of the framework represents a rise of almost \u00a3500,000 compared with the estimated \u00a3960m worth of the first iteration of the arrangement. That deal expires in July 2025 after being extended by six months, taking its total lifespan to four and a half years.\n\nThe original deal was initially awarded to 12 companies in January 2021, but the supplier base dropped by one after Accenture acquired Infinity Works Consulting, one of the other firms featured on the agreement.\n\nNHS England signed contracts with two of the companies on the framework in August 2024 to support the digital transformation of urgent and emergency care (UEC), totalling \u00a386 million in value.\n\nA three-year contract which began on 15 August 2024, with a value of between \u00a328.1 million and \u00a337.4m, was awarded to Kainos Software to support the transformational activities of the digital UEC team.\n\nA second NHSE contract was awarded to Accenture to support the continuous iteration activities in the digital UEC portfolio, which focuses on all products and services under the umbrella of digital UEC.",

Cole believes the incidents described in their complaint, including persistent harassment by their manager, Lawrence Christopher Young, should qualify as a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d under Title VII, thus extending the statute of limitations.\n\nCole\u2019s allegations date back to 2020 when they were assigned to work under Young, who allegedly sent inappropriate and sexually suggestive text messages.

It's also a great time to review your investment portfolio to see if there are attractive growth stocks you can purchase. Undoubtably, 2024 was a great year for the markets, with the S&P 500 index jumping 23%, taking its two-year gain to 53%. The bellwether technology stock index, the Nasdaq Composite, surged by 28.6% last year as enthusiasm around artificial intelligence led to a surge in mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nThese gains, however, do not mean that stocks cannot continue to do well this year. The key is to study the business behind the stock to determine if it possesses a strong track record of financial growth. It should also occupy a dominant position within its industry and have sufficient pricing power to ensure it can stay ahead of cost increases arising from inflation. Ideally, the business should also enjoy sustainable catalysts that can see it sustain multiyear growth, thus generating solid capital gains for its stockholders.\n\nHere are three stocks with solid potential to do well in 2025 that you can consider adding to your investment portfolio.\n\nAccenture\n\nAccenture (ACN -5.35%) is a professional services company that offers consulting services to help governments and businesses build their digital capabilities, optimize their operations, and accelerate revenue and earnings growth. Accenture grew its revenue and net income at a steady pace over the years.\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Revenue $61.594 million $64.111 million $64.896 million Operating income $9.367 million $8.809 million $9.596 million Net income $6.877 million $6.872 million $7.264 million Dividend per share $3.88 $4.48 $5.16\n\nThe professional services company also managed to steadily increase its dividend per share over the three fiscal years, thus making the stock a great pick for both growth and income. These dividend increases are supported by the company's consistent free-cash-flow generation, which averaged around $8.8 billion over these three fiscal years.\n\nAccenture continued to do well for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Revenue increased by 9% year over year to $17.7 billion while operating income climbed 15% year over year to $2.9 billion. Net income grew 15.5% year over year to $2.3 billion, and the company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% year over year to $1.48 per share. The annualized dividend now stands at $5.92, 15% higher than the $5.16 paid out for fiscal 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter more than doubled year over year from $430 million to $870 million. Accenture also upgraded its fiscal 2025 full-year revenue growth estimate to between 4% to 7%, up from the previous estimate of between 3% to 6%.\n\nAccenture's business boasted an excellent return on invested capital exceeding 20% over the past eight quarters, signaling a high-quality business that can compound for many years to come. The business is also growing through acquisitions where management purchases companies to increase Accenture's breadth of service offerings and augment its suite of capabilities. In December, Accenture made two acquisitions: Aox, a German company specializing in embedded software for carmakers and their suppliers, and IQT Group, an Italian company providing engineering-managed services for large infrastructure projects. Accenture in January also acquired a digital twin technology platform developed by Percipient, a Singapore-based fintech, to enhance its core modernization capabilities. These bolt-on acquisitions will provide a further boost for Accenture and help accelerate its growth while making its services even more attractive to current and potential clients.\n\nGrab Holdings\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB 2.40%) developed a super-app that provides mobility, delivery, and digital financial services. Founded in 2012, the company serves over 700 cities in eight southeast Asian countries. Grab grew its business by leaps and bounds over the past several years as it expands its presence in major cities. The business started out reporting a negative gross margin in 2021 as it pushed through rebates and freebies to attract users to its super-app. By 2023, gross margin turned positive while revenue nearly quadrupled in just two years.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $675 million $1.433 billion $2.359 billion Gross profit ($395 million) $77 million $860 million Gross margin (58.5%) 5.4% 36.5%\n\nAlong the way, Grab also saw its cash-flow generation improve dramatically. 2021 saw an operating cash outflow of $954 million, which reversed to an operating cash inflow of $86 million by 2023.\n\nGrab's financials continued to improve in the first nine months of 2024 as monthly transacting user (MTU) numbers continued rising. Revenue climbed 19% year over year to $2 billion while gross profit stood at $842 million, up 44.2% year over year. Grab's gross margin improved to 41.4% for the first nine months of 2024, up from 34.2% in the previous corresponding period. The business also began generating positive free cash flow of $530 million, up more than tenfold year over year from just $43 million in the prior year. Operating metrics showed growth all around with on-demand gross merchandise value rising 15% year over year to $4.7 billion for the third quarter. MTUs climbed from 36 million to 41.9 million over the same period, registering 16% year-over-year growth. The total loans disbursed by Grab's digital financial services division surged 38% year over year to $567 million, mainly attributed to its digital bank, GXS Bank. Bank deposits more than tripled year over year to cross $1 billion.\n\nThe company's momentum looks set to continue as management boosted its earnings forecast for 2024 amid cost cuts. Revenue is projected to end last year at $2.78 billion, up from the previous forecast of $2.75 billion. There is still significant room for expansion in the southeast Asia region of around 650 million people as MTUs hit just close to 42 million in the third quarter. Grab is also raising its platform fees for both food and grocery deliveries and ride-hailing from Jan. 1, a move that should bring in higher levels of revenue for the business. With the company firing on all its three cylinders, investors should expect continued increases in revenue and free cash flow in the coming years.\n\nMiniso Group\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO -11.98%) is a retailer offering a wide variety of trendy lifestyle products. The company has a large network of Miniso stores offering affordable goods with aesthetically pleasing designs in both mainland China and other countries. Miniso saw steady growth in its top line and also saw its losses turn into profits from 2021 to 2023.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue RMB 9.072 billion RMB 10.086 billion RMB 11.473 billion Operating profit RMB 401.035 million RMB 882.027 million RMB 2.223 billion Net profit (RMB 1.415 billion) RMB 638.170 million RMB 1.769 billion\n\nThe business not only generated healthy earnings from 2022 onward, but also consistently churned out positive free cash flow. Free cash flow went from RMB 736 million in 2021 to RMB 1.5 billion by 2023, a more than doubling and a sign that the business has not neglected the importance of generating operating cash flow to sustain its expansion plans.\n\nMiniso's growth has continued unabated in the first nine months of 2024 with revenue rising 22.8% year over year to RMB12.3 billion. Operating income increased by 14.3% year over year to RMB2.3 billion while net income stood at RMB 1.8 billion, up 12% year over year. As of Sept. 30, 2024, Miniso had a total of 7,186 stores in both China and internationally, with its total store count rising by 17.5% year over year from 6,115 a year ago.\n\nManagement has laid down an ambitious strategic roadmap to grow the business further, with the vision of becoming the world's No. 1 intellectual property design retail group. Miniso's goal is to open 900 to 1,100 net new stores each year from 2024 to 2028 and to double its store base by 2028. The target is to grow revenue by more than 20% per year over the same period with a focus on product innovation and expansion in overseas markets. Last September, Miniso acquired a 29.4% stake in Yonghui Superstores, a leading retail chain in China that operates around 850 supermarkets as part of its expansion strategy. Investors can look forward to further growth in Miniso's top and bottom lines as the retailer executes its long-term plan.",

They will get a chance to comment on how his presidency might affect their businesses when they post earnings.\n\nOverall, investors appear to view the incoming administration favorably for the sector, as the NSE Nifty IT Index has outperformed the broader market since the election. The president-elect\u2019s promised tax cuts may result in businesses boosting technology expenditure. On the other hand, \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies may discourage outsourcing, which the Indian companies depend on.\n\n\u201cWhile the rate-cutting cycle has begun and uncertainty of US presidential election is over, their impact on demand improvement is likely to be visible earliest in the upcoming budget cycle of clients\u201d in January-February, analysts at Nomura said in a note.\n\nUS-listed peer Accenture Plc raising its revenue outlook last month showed greater deal flow from widespread generative-artificial intelligence adoption. Net hiring in the Indian IT sector also turned positive in the July-September quarter, analysts at PL Capital said, suggesting companies were preparing for better order inflows. Rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. on Thursday offered some optimism on increasing client spends despite profit undershooting estimates.\n\nAvenue Supermarts Ltd. on Saturday reported profit that missed estimates amid competition from e-commerce companies. The Indian retailer also appointed Unilever veteran Anshul Asawa to replace CEO Ignatius Navil Noronha in February 2026.\n\nFurther east, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. may also need to address geopolitical risks such as potential US tariffs or restrictions affecting its China business, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nCountry Garden Holdings Co. will post earnings for full-year 2023 and the first half of 2024 after delays.

These are mostly mid-level to senior professionals including partners, associate partners, and engagement managers with 10-20 years\u2019 experience, said search industry officials.Leading conglomerates such as Reliance Industries , Mahindra & Mahindra, Aditya Birla Group, Tata Group, and RPG Group are among those vying for the talent pool, according to search executives.A variety of reasons is fuelling the increased demand for experienced professionals. These include conglomerates\u2019 foray into new areas of business, transition from promoter-led to professionally run management, adoption of inorganic growth strategies, cost and work role optimisation, digital/tech-led transformation and rise in multi-agency partnerships.Roles such as chief of staff, chief of strategy, head of change management and transformation, and head of M&A are tailor-made for such candidates. Many of them report to the MD & CEO with a promise of a P&L (profit and loss) role in the near term. A P&L role entails direct responsibility for the financial performance of a business unit or department.\u201cMost of these people are sought for roles that are very dynamic but may not be very structured and defined. As a result, it requires a high level of thinking, strategising and key decision making,\u201d said Suresh Raina, partner at Heidrick & Struggles India, a global executive search firm.\u201cLarge conglomerates look at this pool to hire seasoned hands who have the capability, stamina and comfort to keep pace with the rapidly growing size and scale of their businesses and can operate in a high pressure environment.\u201dWhile large conglomerates mostly prefer talent from the top three strategy houses\u2014Mckinsey, Bain and BCG\u2014the last 1-2 years has also been witness to surging demand for consulting professionals from Big Four and others such as Kearney and Accenture.\u201cIndian companies are investing big time globally and a lot of M&As are also happening, leading large Indian companies to rope in strategy and consulting professionals who have that strategic orientation,\u201d said Jyoti Bowen Nath, managing partner, Claricent Partners, an executive search firm.S.

We have been hiring from this pool,\u201d he said.\u201cStrategy firm hires are sought after due to their pedigree, ability to work with multiple clients across industries, ability to deliver under pressure, and comfort of working with top level executives and C-suite,\u201d said Prabir Jha, founder of Prabir Jha People Advisory and former CHRO at Reliance and Global head \u2013 HR at Tata Motors Companies are offering lucrative packages to rope in such talent with salaries at the senior level\u201415 years or above experience\u2014touching \u20b93-6 crore, said search industry officials.K Sudarshan, MD, India, and regional chair Asia, EMA Partners, said, \u201cThe extremely competitive environment at the strategy firms also leads to some people looking at the option of corporates for career growth where they are often given a P&L role in 2-3 years.\u201d",

            "content": "In the professional services world, few names hold the historical weight of Andersen Consulting. Once synonymous with top-tier consulting in the 1990s, the brand is making a bold return, driven by the vision of George Shaheen, its former CEO, and Andersen Global, a growing tax and legal services powerhouse. The relaunch could be as soon as next month.\n\nThe revival is the latest chapter for a name that has been dormant since 2000, when Andersen Consulting rebranded as Accenture after parting ways with its parent company, Arthur Andersen. Andersen Global, founded by Mark Vorsatz, a former Arthur Andersen tax partner, acquired the rights to the Andersen brand in 2014. While the company has primarily focused on tax and legal services, it\u2019s now setting its sights on a broader consulting market.\n\nOver the past six months, Andersen Global has strategically expanded its consulting arm, adding 20 member firms globally. These new additions include businesses with deep roots in the Andersen legacy, such as Verraki, an African IT solutions firm, and Daniels Consulting, founded by a former Arthur Andersen manager. This expansion is part of a deliberate effort to resurrect Andersen Consulting as a leader in the consulting space.\n\nGeorge Shaheen, who led Andersen Consulting from 1989 to 1999, has been instrumental in shaping the new vision. Under his guidance, the revived Andersen Consulting will focus on offering diverse services, from IT transformation to sustainability and cybersecurity. However, it plans to carve out a distinct identity by avoiding areas like outsourcing, a key focus for Accenture.\n\nThe new Andersen Consulting also benefits from being untethered to an audit business, eliminating the conflict-of-interest issues that plagued its predecessor. Shaheen sees this as a competitive edge, allowing the firm to be more aggressive in pursuing opportunities.\n\nFor professionals over 40, the Andersen name evokes memories of a golden era in consulting. Described as the \u201cCoca-Cola of professional services,\u201d its legacy still resonates. This revival aims not just to capitalize on that legacy but also to redefine it for a new era.\n\nAs Andersen Global explores the possibility of a U.S. IPO, the brand\u2019s rebirth promises a compelling mix of history, innovation, and ambition. The question now is whether this storied name can reclaim its former glory in a rapidly evolving industry. Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: Andersen Consulting is back in the game.",

Sion Touhig/Getty Images\n\nAndersen Consulting was once one of the top names in professional services.\n\nThe firm rebranded to Accenture in 2000, and its parent company went bust following the Enron scandal.\n\nNow Andersen Consulting is making a comeback.\n\nOne of the leading consulting brands of the 1990s, whose parent company was brought down in the Enron scandal, is making a comeback.\n\nAndersen Consulting, which was one of the \"Big Eight\" consulting firms, will relaunch next month, unnamed sources told The Financial Times.\n\nThe firm's comeback has been orchestrated by Andersen, a tax business founded in 2002 by former employees from Arthur Andersen, the once-prestigious accounting firm and the parent company of Andersen Consulting. It acquired rights to the Arthur Andersen name in 2014 and renamed itself Andersen in 2019.\n\nAndersen has mostly focused on tax and legal work but has been steadily building a consulting division under the guidance of George Shaheen, a former CEO of Andersen Consulting in its heyday. Shaheen joined the group as a special advisor in 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIn the past six months, the company has added 20 member firms focused on consulting from the US and other countries, several of which have connections to the old Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen, the FT reported.\n\n\"Six months ago, we began building Andersen Consulting, and already we have 108 offices in 66 countries with nearly 3000 employees,\" Mark Vorsatz, Andersen's CEO, said in a statement sent to Business Insider.\n\n\"We're seeing incredibly fast growth. Our goal in three years is to reach a billion dollars in revenue, which I think is very realistic.\"\n\n\"Our global firm has a massive competitive advantage and this scale creates a unique consulting experience that is unrivaled in the crowded consulting space,\" he added.\n\nThe resurrection of Andersen Consulting marks a major comeback for what was once a leading name in professional services.\n\n\"Andersen Consulting was the Coca-Cola of professional services,\" Vorsatz told the FT. \"If you are over 40 in business, you know Andersen Consulting.\"\n\nThe original Andersen Consulting split from its parent company, Arthur Andersen, in 2000 and rebranded as Accenture.\n\nOne year later, the Andersen name was tarnished when Arthur Andersen became embroiled in the Enron scandal. Executives at Enron, one of the largest energy providers in the US, were found to have hidden billions of dollars in debt by manipulating financial models and lying to investors.\n\nDavid B. Duncan was a senior Arthur Andersen accountant who pleaded guilty to directing the shredding of Enron documents, pictured in 2002. Brett Coomer/Getty Images\n\nEnron filed for bankruptcy, and thousands of employees lost their jobs and retirement savings.\n\nArthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, was found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding its client's auditing documents as the government started its investigation.\n\nThe fallout led to Arthur Andersen's collapse in 2002, reducing the \"Big Five\" global accounting firms to four. It is one of the most dramatic corporate collapses in US history \u2014 one year earlier, the firm had reported roughly $9 billion in global revenue.\n\nThe rebooted version of Andersen Consulting would not try to compete with Accenture as an outsourcing services provider, Vorsatz told the FT.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

In the recent research report, Building Resilient and Agile Supply Chains via Data, Analytics and Automation, companies also recognized the significance of AI/ML in supply chain operations, with 43% of respondents highlighting its increasing prominence on the corporate agenda. External pressures also influence the need to enhance data, analytics, and automation capabilities. Evolving customer expectations and demand (37%) and the pressure to run more sustainable supply chains (36%) indicate a growing societal and environmental consciousness among supply chain leaders.\n\n\u201cFuture warehouses will function like massive autonomous robots, orchestrating fleets of robots within them,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cBy integrating Omniverse and Mega into their solutions, KION and Accenture can dramatically accelerate the development of industrial AI and autonomy for the world\u2019s distribution and logistics ecosystem.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s warehouses and fulfillment centers combine workers, autonomous vehicles, and fully automated systems. Managing these complex environments requires a delicate balance of precision and adaptability\u2014a challenge compounded by fluctuating demand and shifting inventory needs.\n\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse and Mega, KION will be able to provide digital twins of warehouses that allows facility operators to design the most efficient and safe warehouse configuration without interrupting operations for testing. This includes optimizing the number of robots, workers, and automation equipment. The digital twin provides a testing ground for all aspects of warehouse operations, including facility layouts, the behavior of robot fleets, and the optimal number of workers and intelligent vehicles.\n\nThe digital twin doesn\u2019t stop at simulating and testing configurations. It also trains the warehouse robots to handle changing conditions such as demand, inventory fluctuation and layout changes in the best possible way. Integrated with KION\u2019s warehouse management software, the digital twin assigns tasks like moving goods from buffer zones to storage locations to virtual robots. Powered by advanced AI, the virtual robots plan, execute, and refine these tasks in a continuous loop, simulating and ultimately optimizing real-world operations with infinite scenarios. For the CES showcase, Accenture developed an interactive application that tracks how digital robot fleet and facility planning and testing enhances warehouse key performance indicators, such as throughput, task completion time, safety incidents and error rates.\n\nAs a next step, the partners are working to integrate the digital twin with a fine-tuned vision language model to capture real-time insights from warehouses, reducing the risk of bottlenecks, accidents and other unforeseen events, pairing cameras, robots and NVIDIA NIM, a set of services for deployment of foundation models to edge devices in the warehouse.\n\nIn essence, the warehouse of the future will create an environment where both human workers and machines can collaborate seamlessly and safely. It predicts, visualizes and adopts to potential issues and generates data-driven insights for operators. This ultimately helps clients design warehouses that are not only more efficient but also more resilient.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nBuild bridges to your ERP system.

View our editorial policy here.\n\nKION, Accenture, and NVIDIA jointly showcased how clients can define ideal set-ups for new warehouses and continuously enhance existing facilities with Mega, an NVIDIA Omniverse blueprint for large-scale industrial digital twins at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025.\n\nThree companies will bring \u2018digital twins\u2019 to warehouses\n\nThe companies are building physical AI-powered digital twins with NVIDIA software to improve productivity and the functional design of intelligent warehouses, which operate with automated forklifts, smart cameras, and the latest automation and robotics solutions.\n\nBy utilizing both NVIDIA Omniverse and Mega, KION will provide digital twins of warehouses to allow facility operators to design the most efficient and safe warehouse configuration without interrupting operations for testing. This will include optimizing the number of robots, workers, and automation equipment.\n\nThe digital twin will provide a testing ground for all aspects of warehouse operations, including facility layouts, robot fleet behavior, and the optimal number of workers and intelligent vehicles.\n\n\u201cFuture warehouses will function like massive autonomous robots, orchestrating fleets of robots within them,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cBy integrating Omniverse and Mega into their solutions, KION and Accenture can dramatically accelerate the development of industrial AI and autonomy for the world\u2019s distribution and logistics ecosystem.\u201d\n\nFurther, the digital twin will simulate and test configurations, while also training the warehouse robots to handle changing conditions like demand, inventory fluctuations, and layout changes.\n\nThe digital twin will be integrated with KION\u2019s warehouse management software, enabling companies to assign tasks like moving goods from buffer zones to storage locations to virtual robots. Advanced AI will power the virtual robots, which can plan, execute, and refine these tasks in a continuous loop that simulates and optimizes real-world operations with infinite scenarios.\n\n\u201cModernizing supply chains to make them more resilient and agile, with real-time flexibility, is the next digital frontier,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. \u201cThis collaboration with our long-term client KION and partner NVIDIA will break exciting new ground in not only reinventing the warehouse, but also in raising their performance standards with technology, data, and AI, helping our clients operate autonomous, safe supply chains that better serve their customers and consumers, enhance productivity and efficiency, and create new value.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the three partners will work to integrate the digital twin with a fine-tuned vision language model to capture real-time insights from warehouses, reducing the risk of bottlenecks, accidents, and other unforeseen events, pairing cameras, robots, and NVIDIA NIM, a set of services for deployment of foundation models to edge devices in the warehouse.\n\nFurther announcements\n\nThis partnership between the three companies was one of three announcements Accenture made this week to coincide with CES 2025. The company also released its 2025 Technology Vision report, which publicizes research on how AI will drive new levels of autonomy for businesses and unlock innovation opportunities.\n\nThe company also announced Accenture AI Refinery for Industry, a solution containing a collection of 12 industry-specific agent solutions to assist organizations with building and deploying custom AI agents.\n\nAccenture and NVIDIA have made various moves over the past few months to help enterprises scale AI adoption.

Learn More.\n\nIn its 25th annual \u201cTechnology Vision\u201d report, Accenture predicted that artificial intelligence will continue to drive new levels of autonomy across organizations. The report said AI models will need people to have a high level of trust in their performance in order to accomplish this increased autonomy. In fact, 77 percent of executives believe unlocking the true benefits of AI will only be possible if it\u2019s built on a foundation of trust.\n\nThe report urged leaders to prepare not just for AI models to rapidly multiply across many areas of business and life, but also for these models to act autonomously on people\u2019s behalfs. It predicted that increased AI autonomy will lead to increased autonomy for people and systems, as well.\n\nFour Emerging Trends in AI Autonomy\n\nThe Accenture report identified four main AI trends the company predicts will emerge over the next decade or so. The first, \u201cThe Binary Big Bang,\u201d concerns the expansion of artificial intelligence. As AI becomes more embedded in enterprise technology, development costs should drop over time. This means applications will be transformed and new systems will emerge as AI tech accelerates.\n\nThe second trend, \u201cYour Face, in the Future,\u201d focuses on the personalization of AI. As more and more companies adopt AI tools, it will be critical that they individualize the AI models to reflect their unique branding and voice. Otherwise, all the interfaces and chatbots will look and sound the same, making it tough for consumers to tell the difference between one business and another.\n\nThe third trend, \u201cWhen LLMs Get Their Bodies,\u201d centers on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. Accenture forecasted that a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d is coming as foundational models overhaul robotics and hypothesized that these robots will become a physical extension of AI\u2019s cognitive models, becoming more versatile and enduring.\n\nThe fourth and final trend, \u201cThe New Learning Loop,\u201d highlights the importance of training AI models through use. Since AI is a learning technology, it becomes more capable the more that people use it, thereby incentivizing people to use it even more. Accenture dubs this cycle the \u201cNew Learning Loop.\u201d\n\nExplore our list of the top companies defining AI and creating new applications for it across a wide range of industries.",

            "content": "Julie Sweet\n\nTrust is key to the enterprise adoption of AI technologies, according to perhaps one of the least surprising conclusions of the 2025 Accenture Technology Vision report. Other AI-centric findings include the idea that systems will need to be built for AI agents as much as humans and that AI will bring with it a new urgency to enterprise re-invention.\n\nMeanwhile, in a reality check counter to the seemingly never-ending hype cycle, only 36% of executives believe their organizations have scaled gen AI solutions, while only 13% report achieving significant enterprise-level impact.\n\nIs trust the limit of AI\u2019s limitless possibilities, asks the report:\n\nTrust is not simply one of many trends in this year\u2019s report. It is not a consideration for businesses\u2014it is the consideration. With every company beginning to reinvent themselves with the generalization of AI, the technology itself cannot be the only focus. Reaping the benefits of AI will only be possible when it\u2019s built on a foundation of trust, and this needs to be every leader\u2019s first priority.\n\nMany of the themes in this year\u2019s report were touched on by Julie Sweet, Accenture CEO, in a keynote session at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where she said:\n\nI think part of what's been missing is that there are two dimensions to the trust. One dimension is, does it actually work? And that trust comes from using it. And then as you use it, there's a defined way to building that trust. If you get people to learn it, they can see that it works. You have to have change management. You have to build it in. But that's, in some ways, the easiest part of trust. It's an important step, but it's it's the emotional side of trust that is equally important, and that's the trust, which says, 'Wait a minute, is this going to take my job? What's the future going to look like? Is it going to hurt parts of our business?'. It's the part that people get emotionally worried about. It's important, as you think about like change and adoption, that you recognize both components. One is about learning and practice. The other, emotional, is about transparency. It's about empathy. It's also very much about being direct as well. If you get those two pieces right, you will accelerate your ability to really re-invent what you're doing.\n\nRe-inventing the enterprise\n\nThat question of how much and how far things can be re-invented is one that also needs to be addressed, she advised, and that boils down to skills:\n\nOne of my most passionate things is around skills-based human resources. About five years ago, we [at Accenture] built our own database of all of our skills. So, I have 780,000 people, and I have all of their skills in a database. I can actually run an algorithm to say, 'Hey, I need some more cloud people who could be up-skilled in 20 hours'. Why do I care so much about it? It goes back to how are we going to invest in our people, to bring them along the journey? If you don't understand first of all, what skills would need to do the job, and then how they're changing it, you won't be able to give them the education and training to allow them to do it, which means you won't get the value. But it also means they can't rise to the occasion. The very first thing we did [around gen AI] was we went to our technology [people], all of our main roles, and we said, \u2018Which of the roles are affected in the different skills, and what are the brand new roles?\u2019. Like, prompt engineering didn't exist, right? And now we're systematically looking at every role at Accenture, and saying, \u2018What are the skills?\u2019 and then, \u2018How are we going to give it to them?\u2019.\n\nAs to the vexed (cliched?) question of whether AI is going to mean job cuts, Sweet clearly has little time for this line of thought and has some tough love for her contemporaries:\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I actually have is that CEOs will say, 'I'm using all this AI, and I don't have less people', and that's because they haven't re-imagined the work...This goes back to skills and training, but it opens up all these new opportunities for the company, and so that's where you have to get the balance right.\n\nThings change, she added:\n\nWe used to have tens of thousands of people doing testing, and [technology] automated most of them away. We up-skilled them, and they're doing different things. We also have new businesses we didn't have in 2015. You can't stop each wave of technology, can't stop. The question is, do you have the ability to use the technology to build the new businesses? And do you have the ability to re-skill?\n\nOverall Sweet argued that this is a tipping point for enterprise re-invention, citing a meme that fits her mindset:\n\nIf your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough. It''s a personal motto of mine as a leader and as a person, because when I'm feeling like, 'Wow, this is big and it's different', then I know I'm pushing my organization and myself. If you go to work every day and you never feel a little like, 'Wow, can we really pull this off?', then most likely someone is passing you by. As an individual, you're all going to have to change. I'm changing the whole way I work and integrating AI and, you know, it sometimes feels uncomfortable.\n\nBut she concluded:\n\nWe've got to dream big to make sure that we use this tremendous technology to benefit everyone.\n\nMy take\n\nSome familiar themes ticked off in this CES presentation by the Accenture CEO, but none the less valid for all that. As to the Technology Vision report, this 25th edition does cover a lot of interesting ground, including an exploration of physical AI in the form of the rise of robotics in the enterprise.

            "content": "Accenture (ACN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this consulting company have returned -0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which Accenture falls in, has lost 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Accenture is expected to post earnings of $2.78 per share, indicating a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.70 points to a change of +6.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.69 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Accenture is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Accenture.\n\nStory Continues",

At work, she has devoted time to mastering this subject. At home, she\u2019s diving into the world of baking; a new challenge for her, but she\u2019s eager to improve and create delicious treats.\n\nWith Responsible AI as a new competency, companies like Accenture are integrating it into their services and technology.\n\nAt Accenture, responsible AI is a compliance program overseen by the board\u2019s audit committee, which reviews risks and challenges to ensure that responsible AI practices effectively address them.\n\nIn 2023, Accenture announced a $3 billion investment in artificial intelligence (AI) over three years and plans to expand its data and AI practice staff to 80,000.\n\nThe company supports businesses, governments, and other organizations in building their digital core, optimizing operations, accelerating revenue growth, and enhancing citizen services, among other objectives.\n\nSweet has been the Chair and CEO of Accenture since she took on the role, making her the firm\u2019s first female CEO in its 35-year history.\n\nShe frequently discusses the significance of AI at Accenture, the company\u2019s journey with AI, and how technology, data, and AI are being used to transform every aspect of the business.\n\nFor Sweet, transformation involves upgrading technology and investing in talent, change, and rethinking processes.\n\nAccenture is focused on \u201ccompressed transformation,\u201d which helps clients accelerate their progress.\n\nOne important lesson learned from the Covid-19 pandemic is that changes do not have to be implemented sequentially; organizations can adapt their ways of working and culture significantly faster than previously believed.\n\nSweet sees a similar opportunity with the rise of generative AI, which only becomes powerful when workflows are altered.\n\nAchieving compressed transformation requires understanding the necessary steps to rewire an organization rather than simply stating, \u201cHere\u2019s the technology, and this is the outcome I want.\u201d\n\nThe AI-focused team at Accenture helps clients build the right data foundation and AI infrastructure while collaborating with industry or functional specialists to redefine what\u2019s possible.\n\nThe team started with 40,000 people and has grown to 53,000. Sweet aims to expand this team to over 80,000 by the end of 2026. Additionally, Accenture plans to train its 700,000 employees in generative AI.\n\nIn 2019, the company projected that the upcoming decade would be centered on leveraging technology, data, and AI.\n\nAccenture assessed the technology capabilities of 600,000 employees to prepare a future-ready workforce, providing training in traditional AI as a foundation. Microsoft Copilot played a crucial role in this transformation and increased productivity.\n\nSweet emphasizes the need for individuals who are eager to learn and adapt as skills and competencies continually evolve.\n\nExcellent communication skills are also essential. \u201cIf you are in a constant state of reinvention in technology, you must excel at change,\u201d Sweet stated, highlighting the future of work and the importance of effectively utilizing generative AI to succeed in the changing landscape.\n\nSweet has also announced a $1 billion investment in Accenture LearnVantage, a new learning platform designed to help clients generate business value and enable their workforce to develop the necessary technology, data, and AI skills to thrive in the AI economy.\n\nThis investment is further strengthened by their agreement to acquire Udacity, a leader in digital education that aligns with hands-on learning approach and will help enhance the robust training and skills development currently provided for employees.\n\nTake a listen to the CES 2025 Keynote with Accenture Chair and CEO, Julie Sweet.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other stocks that partnered with NVIDIA this month.\n\nNvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company\u2019s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs.\n\nFor many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock. If you\u2019re in the same boat and find it hard to buy a stock at its all-time highs, you may want to consider investing in companies that work with Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing technologies are powering many companies' products, especially those related to AI and autonomy.\n\nAccenture plc (ACN) Reports Strong Q1 Growth and Increased AI Bookings, Price Target Raised to $428 by Mizuho\n\nA team of data experts gathered around a computer monitor analyzing customer data.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a professional services company that specializes in consulting, strategy, operations, and digital technology. The company, together with a supply chain solutions company KION Group, is leveraging Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse to improve business operations.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) will help KION improve the performance of warehouses through its expertise in digital technologies. The idea here is to create a digital twin using Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse and use that digital twin to optimize and automate their operations. KION, a long-time client of Accenture, will accelerate the emergence of autonomous warehouses and factories by streamlining operations for future autonomous robots.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang had this to say about the partnership with Accenture:\n\nBy integrating Omniverse and Mega into their solutions, KION and Accenture can dramatically accelerate the development of industrial AI and autonomy for the world\u2019s distribution and logistics ecosystem.\n\nAccenture stock has traded range-bound for over two years and this partnership with Nvidia could well be the catalyst that triggers the stock\u2019s next bull run.\n\nOverall, ACN ranks 8th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Accenture Technology Vision 2025 also predicts AI will act as a technology development partner, a personal brand ambassador, empower robotic bodies in the physical world, and foster a new symbiotic relationship with people to bring out the best in each other.\n\nThe Accenture Technology Vision 2025 explores the potential impact of gen AI as it ripples across multiple dimensions, including technology development, customer experience, the physical world and the workforce:\n\n\u2013 Already, gen AI coding assistants are elevating the role of developer to systems engineer, accelerating the democratization of code and digitization of businesses. The rise of custom systems as a result of gen AI assisted software development and the advancement of AI agents is igniting a shift from static application architecture to intention-based framework and agentic systems. As multi-agent systems become more capable, adaptive and personalized, it will inspire greater diffusion through enhanced competence, growing to manage processes and entire functions, from streamlining travel to optimizing inventory.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Organizations are racing to make AI a new customer touch point but brands will only be able to achieve brand differentiation if the same focus is applied to AI experiences. While 80% of executives worry LLMs and chatbots could give every brand a similar voice, 77% agree brands can solve by proactively building personified AI experiences and injecting distinct brand elements, such as culture, values and voice, into those experiences through its digital brain.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Generalist robots will emerge over the next decade, bringing more AI autonomy into the physical world. It will be possible for introductory general-purpose robots to become specialist robots, learning new tasks very quickly.\n\n\n\n\u2013 People and AI are defining a virtuous learning loop: where the more people use AI, the more it improves, and the more people want to use it. Unlike conventional automation, which yielded one-time benefits, this new age of AI can enhance and advance its skills over time, improving its value to the individuals using it and the organization as a whole.\n\nSource: VCWire\n\nSee more: ChatMatch: A game-changer in the random video chat industry\n\nSee more: Ultrahuman unveils Rare, the world\u2019s first luxury smart ring at CES 2025\n\nSee more: NJ FAST powered by Plug and Play graduates 14 startups in its inaugural program",

That includes optimizing the number of robots, workers, and automation equipment. The digital twin provides a testing ground for all aspects of warehouse operations, including facility layouts, the behavior of robot fleets, and the optimal number of workers and intelligent vehicles, the company said.\n\nIn that approach, the digital twin doesn\u2019t stop at simulating and testing configurations, but it also trains the warehouse robots to handle changing conditions such as demand, inventory fluctuation, and layout changes. Integrated with Kion\u2019s warehouse management software (WMS), the digital twin assigns tasks like moving goods from buffer zones to storage locations to virtual robots. And powered by advanced AI, the virtual robots plan, execute, and refine these tasks in a continuous loop, simulating and ultimately optimizing real-world operations with infinite scenarios, Kion said.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Accenture is US$341 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nWith US$356 share price, Accenture appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\nwhich is 15% above our fair value estimate\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Accenture plc ( ) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.03b US$10.3b US$11.5b US$12.7b US$13.4b US$14.0b US$14.5b US$15.0b US$15.5b US$16.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x7 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 4.25% Est @ 3.76% Est @ 3.42% Est @ 3.18% Est @ 3.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$8.3k US$8.8k US$9.1k US$9.3k US$9.0k US$8.7k US$8.3k US$7.9k US$7.6k US$7.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$16b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$287b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$287b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$129b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$213b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$356, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Accenture as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.177. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Accenture\n\nStrength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Accenture, we've compiled three important factors you should look at:\n\nFinancial Health: Does ACN have a healthy balance sheet? Take a look at our on key factors like leverage and risk.

            "content": "NEW YORK and LAS VEGAS; Jan. 7, 2025 \u2013 New research from Accenture (NYSE: ACN) finds a new era of digitization is unfolding\u2014one in which AI continuously learns and drives new levels of autonomy across organizations, positioning trust in its performance as the most important measure organizations will need for AI to achieve its promise.\n\nNow in its 25th year, the Accenture Technology Vision 2025 explores how the future is being shaped by AI-powered autonomy. As AI diffusion accelerates across the enterprise and society at a rate that is faster than any prior technology, 69% of executives believe it brings new urgency to reinvention and how technology systems and the processes it enables are designed, built and operated. The research also predicts AI will increasingly act as a technology development partner, a personal brand ambassador, power robotic bodies in the physical world, and foster a new symbiotic relationship with people to bring out the best in each other.\n\n\"Our 25th Technology Vision gives leaders a look into what\u2019s ahead when AI continuously learns, acts autonomously with and on behalf of people, and pushes enterprises and the people who use it into new and exciting ways to continuously reinvent,\" said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. \u201cBut unlocking the benefits of AI will only be possible if leaders seize the opportunity to inject and develop trust in its performance and outcomes in a systematic manner so businesses and people can unlock AI\u2019s incredible possibilities.\"\n\nPeople\u2019s trust in AI\u2014beyond any technical aspect, that it performs justly and as expected\u2014is essential to it having as broad and positive an impact as anticipated. This means digital systems and AI models are more accurate, predictable, consistent and traceable, over and above the responsible use of AI. Most (77%) executives believe the true benefits of AI will only be possible when built on a foundation of trust , and slightly more (81%) agree that trust strategy must evolve in parallel with any technology strategy.\n\n\u201cAdvancements in digitizing knowledge, new AI models, agentic AI systems and architecture enables enterprises to create their own unique cognitive digital brains.\u201d said Karthik Narain, group chief executive - Technology and CTO, Accenture. \u201cWhile conventional technologies have long supported pre-determined business needs, this is a generational moment of transition. The autonomy created by these generalized AI systems can help organizations be more dynamic and intention-driven than ever. It will allow leaders to rethink how digital systems are designed, how people work, and reinvent how they create products and interact with customers. But trust underpins it all, as systems will only ever be as autonomous as they are trustworthy.\u201d\n\nThe Accenture Technology Vision 2025 explores the potential impact of gen AI as it ripples across multiple dimensions, including technology development, customer experience, the physical world and the workforce:\n\nWhen foundation models cracked the natural language barrier, it kickstarted a shift that would forever change the fundamentals of software development and ecosystems. Already, gen AI coding assistants are elevating the role of developer to systems engineer, accelerating the democratization of code and digitization of businesses. The rise of custom systems as a result of gen AI assisted software development and the advancement of AI agents is igniting a shift from static application architecture to intention-based framework and agentic systems. As multi-agent systems become more capable, adaptive and personalized, it will inspire greater diffusion through enhanced competence, growing to manage processes and entire functions, from streamlining travel to optimizing inventory. For example, Accenture is enabling this future with its platforms, GenWizard, SynOps and AI Refinery, offering prebuilt industry agents and workflows to accelerate the time needed to build and see value from specialized multiagent systems.\n\nOrganizations are racing to make AI a new customer touch point but brands will only be able to achieve brand differentiation if the same focus is applied to AI experiences. While 80% of executives worry LLMs and chatbots could give every brand a similar voice, 77% agree brands can solve by proactively building personified AI experiences and injecting distinct brand elements, such as culture, values and voice, into those experiences through its digital brain.\n\nGeneralist robots will emerge over the next decade, bringing more AI autonomy into the physical world. It will be possible for introductory general-purpose robots to become specialist robots, learning new tasks very quickly. Already, KION Group is teaming with Accenture and NVIDIA, to optimize how AI-driven robots perform warehouse tasks and seamlessly interact with warehouse staff to fulfill orders faster, safer and at a lower cost. Eighty percent of executives believe that robots collaborating with people and continuously learning from those interactions will increase trust and collaboration between people and robots.\n\nPeople and AI are defining a virtuous learning loop: where the more people use AI, the more it improves, and the more people want to use it. Unlike conventional automation, which yielded one-time benefits, this new age of AI can enhance and advance its skills over time, improving its value to the individuals using it and the organization as a whole. A key priority (80%) for leaders is ensuring a positive relationship trajectory between people and AI\u2014so it is not derailed by fears of automation\u2014starting with communicating the strategy and bringing employees into the process. Accenture recently unveiled a Generative AI Scholars Program with Stanford Online to help clients sharpen gen AI knowledge and skills. In addition, organizations have the opportunity to equip every employee with a talented digital sidekick, one that will allow people to tap into new skills and grow use of gen AI tools. In turn, organizations will reap the benefit too, as individuals familiar with gen AI were found five-times more likely to have a positive perception of the technology.\n\nThe Technology Vision 2025 findings will be presented at CES 2025 on Jan. 7 from 2:00 \u2013 2:40 p.m. PST during a livestreamed presentation at live.ces.tech.\n\nAbout the Research\n\nFor 25 years, Accenture\u2019s Technology Vision has taken a systematic look across the enterprise landscape to identify technology trends with the highest likelihood of disrupting businesses and industries.

            "content": "SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has acquired a digital twin technology platform for banks developed by Percipient, a Singapore-based fintech company with deep experience in banking technology transformation. The acquisition enhances Accenture\u2019s existing banking modernization capabilities, helping financial services clients in Asia Pacific accelerate the reinvention of their core systems, foster innovation and drive growth.\n\nPercipient\u2019s platform serves as a digital twin\u2014or virtual duplicate\u2014of banks\u2019 legacy and modern systems, integrating and unifying the data from each one into a single-real time hub. This can reduce the challenges that many banks face around core modernizations by simplifying the application of data and enabling faster development of new products and services, all without overhauling existing systems or disrupting operations.\n\nIntegrating Percipient\u2019s digital twin solution further complements Accenture\u2019s capabilities to help banks decouple from legacy systems and embrace cloud and AI-led banking services. Banks that shift to a modern, cloud-enabled digital core can attain up to 60% higher revenue growth rates and a 40% increase in profits, according to recent research from Accenture.\n\n\u201cBanks\u2019 core systems are often decades old, with layers of tangled code that are costly to maintain, reduce business flexibility and require highly specialized talent, making the need for transformation urgent,\u201d said Masashi Nakano, Accenture\u2019s Financial Services lead for Asia Pacific. \u201cPercipient\u2019s unique capabilities strengthen our existing core modernization offerings, enabling banks to efficiently unlock new opportunities for growth, launch new products faster, and deepen customer engagement through cloud, data, and AI.\u201d\n\nNavin Suri, the founder and CEO of Percipient who joins Accenture together with Percipient\u2019s core technology leadership team, said: \u201cWe have a shared vision to reinvent how digital transformation is achieved at financial institutions. By combining Percipient\u2019s platform with Accenture\u2019s core banking and technology capabilities, we can enable banks to more seamlessly transform their legacy systems and gain agility and speed, while lowering the risk associated with such modernization efforts.\u201d\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nExcept for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nNow in its 25th year, the Accenture Technology Vision 2025 explores how the future is being shaped by AI-powered autonomy. As AI diffusion accelerates across the enterprise and society at a rate that is faster than any prior technology, 69% of executives believe it brings new urgency to reinvention and how technology systems and the processes it enables are designed, built and operated. The research also predicts AI will increasingly act as a technology development partner, a personal brand ambassador, power robotic bodies in the physical world, and foster a new symbiotic relationship with people to bring out the best in each other.\n\n\"Our 25th Technology Vision gives leaders a look into what\u2019s ahead when AI continuously learns, acts autonomously with and on behalf of people, and pushes enterprises and the people who use it into new and exciting ways to continuously reinvent,\" said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. \u201cBut unlocking the benefits of AI will only be possible if leaders seize the opportunity to inject and develop trust in its performance and outcomes in a systematic manner so businesses and people can unlock AI\u2019s incredible possibilities.\"\n\nPeople\u2019s trust in AI\u2014beyond any technical aspect, that it performs justly and as expected\u2014is essential to it having as broad and positive an impact as anticipated. This means digital systems and AI models are more accurate, predictable, consistent and traceable, over and above the responsible use of AI. Most ( 77% ) executives believe the true benefits of AI will only be possible when built on a foundation of trust, and slightly more ( 81% ) agree that trust strategy must evolve in parallel with any technology strategy. \u201cAdvancements in digitizing knowledge, new AI models, agentic AI systems and architecture enables enterprises to create their own unique cognitive digital brains,\u201d said Karthik Narain, group chief executive - Technology and CTO, Accenture. \u201cWhile conventional technologies have long supported pre-determined business needs, this is a generational moment of transition. The autonomy created by these generalized AI systems can help organizations be more dynamic and intention-driven than ever. It will allow leaders to rethink how digital systems are designed, how people work, and reinvent how they create products and interact with customers. But trust underpins it all, as systems will only ever be as autonomous as they are trustworthy.\u201d\n\nThe Accenture Technology Vision 2025 explores the potential impact of gen AI as it ripples across multiple dimensions, including technology development, customer experience, the physical world and the workforce:\n\nWhen foundation models cracked the natural language barrier, it kickstarted a shift that would forever change the fundamentals of software development and ecosystems. Already, gen AI coding assistants are elevating the role of developer to systems engineer, accelerating the democratization of code and digitization of businesses. The rise of custom systems as a result of gen AI assisted software development and the advancement of AI agents is igniting a shift from static application architecture to intention-based framework and agentic systems. As multi-agent systems become more capable, adaptive and personalized, it will inspire greater diffusion through enhanced competence, growing to manage processes and entire functions, from streamlining travel to optimizing inventory. For example, Accenture is enabling this future with its platforms, GenWizard, SynOps and AI Refinery, offering prebuilt industry agents and workflows to accelerate the time needed to build and see value from specialized multiagent systems.\n\nOrganizations are racing to make AI a new customer touch point but brands will only be able to achieve brand differentiation if the same focus is applied to AI experiences. While 80% of executives worry LLMs and chatbots could give every brand a similar voice, 77% agree brands can solve by proactively building personified AI experiences and injecting distinct brand elements, such as culture, values and voice, into those experiences through its digital brain.\n\nof executives worry LLMs and chatbots could give every brand a similar voice, agree brands can solve by proactively building personified AI experiences and injecting distinct brand elements, such as culture, values and voice, into those experiences through its digital brain. Generalist robots will emerge over the next decade, bringing more AI autonomy into the physical world. It will be possible for introductory general-purpose robots to become specialist robots, learning new tasks very quickly. Already, KION Group is teaming with Accenture and NVIDIA, to optimize how AI-driven robots perform warehouse tasks and seamlessly interact with and learn from warehouse staff to fulfill orders faster, safer and at a lower cost. Eighty percent of executives believe that robots collaborating with people and continuously learning from those interactions will increase trust and collaboration between people and robots.\n\nPeople and AI are defining a virtuous learning loop: where the more people use AI, the more it improves, and the more people want to use it. Unlike conventional automation, which yielded one-time benefits, this new age of AI can enhance and advance its skills over time, improving its value to the individuals using it and the organization as a whole. A key priority ( 80% ) for leaders is ensuring a positive relationship trajectory between people and AI\u2014so it is not derailed by fears of automation\u2014starting with communicating the strategy and bringing employees into the process. Accenture recently unveiled a Generative AI Scholars Program with Stanford Online to help clients sharpen gen AI knowledge and skills. In addition, organizations have the opportunity to equip every employee with a talented digital sidekick, one that will allow people to tap into new skills and grow use of gen AI tools. In turn, organizations will reap the benefit too, as individuals familiar with gen AI were found five-times more likely to have a positive perception of the technology.\n\nThe Technology Vision 2025 findings will be presented at CES 2025 on Jan. 7 from 2:00 \u2013 2:40 p.m. PST during a livestreamed presentation at live.ces.tech.\n\nAbout the Research\n\nFor 25 years, Accenture\u2019s Technology Vision has taken a systematic look across the enterprise landscape to identify technology trends with the highest likelihood of disrupting businesses and industries.

            "content": "Researchers at the University of Sydney use Claude to analyze vast acoustic datasets in real time for whale conservation through their partnership with Accenture, increasing detection accuracy while transforming a two-week manual process into instant insights.\n\nWith Claude, the research team achieved:\n\n89.4% accuracy in detecting minke whales, compared to 76.5% with traditional methods\n\nReal-time analysis of data that previously took two weeks to process manually\n\nCoverage of thousands of kilometers of North American coastline\n\nAnalysis of hundreds of thousands of acoustic recordings annually\n\nMeeting the urgent need for scalable marine conservation\n\nMarine conservation is shifting toward non-invasive monitoring methods, moving away from traditional approaches like trapping and tagging whales. This transition has led to a vast network of underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed across coastlines. While this approach is better for the whales, it has created a new challenge: processing an overwhelming amount of acoustic data. \"Traditionally, each recording is manually processed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in a significant portion of unused data,\" said Oscar Mower, researcher at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe stakes are particularly high given recent developments in commercial whaling. With many countries\u2014including Japan\u2014investing in new whaling vessels, the need for accurate population monitoring has never been more critical. Traditional analysis methods and basic detection tools like the band limited energy detector, with its 76.5% accuracy rate, cannot keep pace with the volume of data being collected.\n\nSelecting Claude for superior accuracy and efficiency\n\nAfter evaluating multiple AI models, the research team selected Claude Opus for three key advantages. First, Claude demonstrated exceptional reasoning and computer vision capabilities when analyzing spectrograms\u2014the visual patterns created from whale sounds. During preliminary testing, Claude successfully analyzed hundreds of spectrograms, establishing a strong baseline for measuring improvements.\n\nSecond, Claude's foundation models were valuable given the unique challenges of marine species data. Through transfer learning, Claude required significantly less training data to become proficient at identifying minke whale vocalizations. \"This capability was crucial since labeled acoustic data for marine species is extremely limited,\" said Mower. The ability to achieve high accuracy with smaller training datasets made Claude the ideal choice for marine conservation work.\n\nHow Claude transforms marine acoustic analysis\n\nThe team created a dual AI system that combines two types of artificial intelligence. Data is initially transformed from raw underwater sound recordings into visual charts called spectrograms. These spectrograms are like sound fingerprints that show the unique patterns of whale calls. Claude then uses its advanced visual recognition capabilities, in parallel with a specialised AI network called a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to analyse these spectrograms and identify whale activity with unprecedented accuracy . This approach enabled four key breakthroughs in whale conservation:\n\nReal-time monitoring of whale populations across vast ocean areas, replacing manual processes that took weeks\n\nPrecise mapping of migration patterns and critical habitats, informing protected area decisions\n\nDetailed assessment of how human activities like shipping and drilling affect whale behavior\n\nStandardized data sharing between international conservation groups, enabling coordinated protection efforts\n\nDriving measurable conservation impact\n\nClaude's integration has transformed how researchers protect whales by enabling immediate, data-driven actions. Mower said, \"By leveraging CNN models and AI AWS models, we can detect minke whales within a five-kilometer radius of a hydrophone with up to 89.4% accuracy.\" This real-time detection replaces analysis that previously took weeks, allowing conservation teams to act when and where it matters most.\n\nThe real-world impact is significant. Conservation teams can use accurate, up-to-the-minute whale location data to:\n\nCreate protected zones along major migration routes and breeding grounds\n\nRedirect shipping traffic away from areas where whales are present\n\nPause or modify drilling operations when whales are detected nearby\n\nAdjust fishing zones and enforce stricter regulations to prevent gear entanglement\n\nThese interventions address several of the main threats to whale populations. The solution provides practical tools for keeping whales safe by reducing ocean noise from industrial activities and preventing vessel strikes, which claim the lives of thousands of whales annually.\n\nThe partnership between Accenture and the University of Sydney made this breakthrough possible. Accenture provided the computing power\u2014specialized processors and cloud resources\u2014while the University of Sydney brought deep marine biology expertise. Together, they've created a system that's already saving whale lives.\n\nExpanding the future of AI-powered conservation\n\nThe team sees their success with minke whales as just the beginning. They're working to expand their solution through multiclass classification and transfer learning, aiming to protect a broader range of marine species. Luke Higgins, Managing Director from Accenture, said, \"This solution could scale to other marine species, impacting global conservation efforts.\"\n\nAs human activity in oceans increases and climate change threatens marine ecosystems, the research team views their partnership with Claude as essential to developing sustainable, long-term conservation strategies. Their vision extends beyond individual species to creating a comprehensive system for protecting marine ecosystems through AI-powered insights, setting new standards for conservation.",

Managing these complex environments requires a delicate balance of precision and adaptability\u2014a challenge compounded by fluctuating demand and shifting inventory needs.\n\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse and Mega, KION will be able to provide digital twins of warehouses that allows facility operators to design the most efficient and safe warehouse configuration without interrupting operations for testing. This includes optimizing the number of robots, workers, and automation equipment. The digital twin provides a testing ground for all aspects of warehouse operations, including facility layouts, the behavior of robot fleets, and the optimal number of workers and intelligent vehicles.\n\nThe digital twin doesn\u2019t stop at simulating and testing configurations. It also trains the warehouse robots to handle changing conditions such as demand, inventory fluctuation and layout changes in the best possible way. Integrated with KION\u2019s warehouse management software, the digital twin assigns tasks like moving goods from buffer zones to storage locations to virtual robots. Powered by advanced AI, the virtual robots plan, execute, and refine these tasks in a continuous loop, simulating and ultimately optimizing real-world operations with infinite scenarios. For the CES showcase, Accenture developed an interactive application that tracks how digital robot fleet and facility planning and testing enhances warehouse key performance indicators, such as throughput, task completion time, safety incidents and error rates.\n\nAs a next step, the partners are working to integrate the digital twin with a fine-tuned vision language model to capture real-time insights from warehouses, reducing the risk of bottlenecks, accidents and other unforeseen events, pairing cameras, robots and NVIDIA NIM, a set of services for deployment of foundation models to edge devices in the warehouse.\n\nIn essence, the warehouse of the future will create an environment where both human workers and machines can collaborate seamlessly and safely. It predicts, visualizes and adopts to potential issues and generates data-driven insights for operators. This ultimately helps clients design warehouses that are not only more efficient but also more resilient.\n\n1 The AI and robotics-powered warehouse is showcased at CES at the Accenture Innovation Hub in Ballroom \"F\" of The Venetian Convention and Expo Center, 201 Sands Ave, Las Vegas.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other January dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks fell short of investor expectations, largely due to the continuing AI boom and a heightened interest in technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrats index lagged behind the broader market during the year. However, analysts remain optimistic about the future of dividend equities. This positive sentiment is driven by the fact that many US companies have ample cash reserves to sustain their dividend payments. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reported that large-cap US companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash, which could be used to either start or enhance dividend payouts.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024\n\nDespite the lack of enthusiasm for dividend stocks, analysts believe they still offer attractive entry points for investors. Capital Group suggested seeking opportunities in dividend-paying companies that the market has overlooked. This includes pharmaceutical firms that have been neglected due to the current focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and certain banks. Within the dividend space, investors are increasingly drawn toward dividend growth stocks that offer consistent yields. Stocks that pay dividends and boast solid balance sheets with attractive yields can provide reliable income, protect against market declines, and support healthy investment growth. A report by ProShares highlighted that since its inception, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For instance, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023.\n\nThe report also mentioned that the index has demonstrated strong performance in both up and down markets, with an upside capture of 91% and a downside capture of 80%. It has shown notable resilience during market downturns, outperforming the wider market by more than 12% in 2022. In addition, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the market in eight of the 10 worst quarterly declines since 2005.\n\nSince the start of 2025, the broader market has only seen a modest increase of 0.66%. In this environment, UBS has identified stocks that are considered high quality compared to their peers and are unlikely to reduce their current dividend payouts. The firm estimates a 22.9% chance of dividend cuts across various regions and sectors, noting that the US remains the most secure region for dividends, with only a 6.2% likelihood of cuts. Moreover, most sectors in the US appear relatively stable. Japan stands out as the most favorable region for dividend growth, with a projected growth rate of 9.9%.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "UNLIMITED is riding the crest of a wave right now, and there are no signs of that slowing\n\ndown anytime soon. The business has just picked up the McDonald's customer relationship\n\nmanagement account for the UK and Ireland, continuing a hot streak on the new business front.\n\n\n\nThe group consists of integrated creative agency TMW, Walnut, UNLIMITED\u2019s market\n\nresearch agency, B2B communications and content marketing agency , Nelson Bostock, and healthcare comms agency Health Unlimited . UNLIMITED is being integrated to scale Accenture Song's Al abilities and underline its evolving creative credentials.\n\n\n\nUntil early this year, a case could be made for the group being unintentionally one of the\n\nbest-kept secrets in the advertising community despite it being 38 years old, employing over 600 people, winning numerous awards and working for clients such as the Cabinet Office, Canon and Vodafone.\n\n\n\nLast year, TMW alone won 24 pitches, totaling \u00a37.9 million in new revenue, including Suzuki, Oak Furnitureland, People's Postcode Lottery and Rail Delivery Group.\n\n\n\nBut in April, things certainly changed when the group was acquired by one of the world\u2019s\n\nlargest business consultancies, Accenture, to become part of its creative arm, Accenture Song, which has heightened its new business pipeline even further due to its substantially strengthened offer.\n\n\n\nTony Walford, founder of Green Square which handles mergers and acquisitions, describes\n\nthe deal as having \u201ca smart rationale\u201d that will bring \u201cspecialist elements to Accenture Song's broader offer.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, the group sits proudly alongside major agency names such as Droga5. Within just six\n\nmonths the acquisition has already begun to bear fruit having just won McDonald\u2019s CRM account, something it would have been unlikely to have achieved without the collective might of its new parent company.\n\nMichelle Graham-Clare, CMO UK and Ireland for McDonald\u2019s UK and Ireland says of the hire: \u201cTMW demonstrated a true passion for our brand. Their use of customer data, strategic thinking, as well as creativity was exceptional and we look forward to utilising this partnership as a way to build world-class CRM that delights our customers at every touchpoint.\u201d\n\nAmbitious Leadership\n\nChris Mellish, group chief executive of UNLIMITED, sees the move as part of the leadership\n\nteam\u2019s collective drive to take on the traditional agency networks from which many of them\n\nhave heralded. Mellish, who always comes across as a calm and approachable leader, has a great ambition for UNLIMITED\u2019s progress.\n\n\n\nA former president of BIMA, Mellish has spent more than two decades developing digital\n\nmarketing solutions. He joined the business in 2019 from Razorfish where he spent 14\n\nyears, to become the chief executive of TMW before being promoted to lead UNLIMITED last year.\n\n\n\nUNLIMITED has a clear point of difference, he believes, through its modern integrated offer alongside its deeper understanding of consumers through behavioural and neuroscience as part of its Human Understanding Lab launched in 2022.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, we made the decision to put PhD-level thinking at the heart of everything we do and combine that with our unique perspective on integrating the customer journey. It\u2019s really struck a chord with the market and we\u2019ve seen an incredible period of growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat has been exemplified in Accenture Song being named on McDonald\u2019s CRM Agency\n\nRoster, with TMW leading the pitch in the UK and Ireland, subsequently becoming the first\n\nagency appointed as part of the global roster review. Accenture offered scale and expertise to support the process, but TMW led on both creative and strategy.\n\n\n\nMellish explains that the proposition around \u201ctrue integration\u201d was something he held a\n\nstrong belief in when it came to delivering stronger customer engagement calendars \u201cmore\n\ninspiring\u201d and integrated campaigns \u201cmore effective\u201d for clients. Now, he feels that is self-\n\nevident following the positive response by the McDonald\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThis was our first opportunity to pitch alongside the rest of the Accenture Song, and it has\n\ndemonstrated immediately the scale and potency that we have added to each other\u2019s\n\nofferings,\u201d he continues.\n\nBreak On Through\n\nDebut campaigns for new clients have been released in recent months, showcasing an evolution in strength. That included TMW\u2019s first work for Suzuki offering a very different type of car ad. Its campaign was designed to help the Suzuki Swift stand out against \u2018increasingly formulaic ads\u2019, presenting the different lengths that owners would go to just to keep the car from growing in popularity.",

            "content": "New framework enables next era of industrial AI and robot simulation through software-defined testing and optimization to factories and warehouses.\n\nAccording to Gartner, the worldwide end-user spending on all IT products for 2024 was $5 trillion. This industry is built on a computing fabric of electrons, is fully software-defined, accelerated \u2014 and now generative AI-enabled. While huge, it\u2019s a fraction of the larger physical industrial market that relies on the movement of atoms.\n\nToday\u2019s 10 million factories, nearly 200,000 warehouses and 40 million miles of highways form the \u201ccomputing\u201d fabric of our physical world. But that vast network of production facilities and distribution centers is still laboriously and manually designed, operated and optimized.\n\nIn warehousing and distribution, operators face highly complex decision optimization problems \u2014 matrices of variables and interdependencies across human workers, robotic and agentic systems and equipment. Unlike the IT industry, the physical industrial market is still waiting for its own software-defined moment.\n\nThat moment is coming.\n\nNVIDIA today at CES announced \u201cMega,\u201d an Omniverse Blueprint for developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a digital twin before deployment into real-world facilities.\n\nAdvanced warehouses and factories use fleets of hundreds of autonomous mobile robots, robotic arm manipulators and humanoids working alongside people. With implementations of increasingly complex systems of sensor and robot autonomy, it requires coordinated training in simulation to optimize operations, help ensure safety and avoid disruptions.\n\nMega offers enterprises a reference architecture of NVIDIA accelerated computing, AI, NVIDIA Isaac and NVIDIA Omniverse technologies to develop and test digital twins for testing AI-powered robot brains that drive robots, video analytics AI agents, equipment and more for handling enormous complexity and scale. The new framework brings software-defined capabilities to physical facilities, enabling continuous development, testing, optimization and deployment.\n\nDeveloping AI Brains With World Simulator for Autonomous Orchestration\n\nWith Mega-driven digital twins, including a world simulator that coordinates all robot activities and sensor data, enterprises can continuously update facility robot brains for intelligent routes and tasks for operational efficiencies.\n\nThe blueprint uses Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs that enable robotics developers to render sensor data from any type of intelligent machine in the factory, simultaneously, for high-fidelity large-scale sensor simulation. This allows robots to be tested in an infinite number of scenarios within the digital twin, using synthetic data in a software-in\u2013the-loop pipeline with NVIDIA Isaac ROS.\n\nSupply chain solutions company KION Group is collaborating with Accenture and NVIDIA as the first to adopt Mega for optimizing operations in retail, consumer packaged goods, parcel services and more.\n\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, offered a glimpse into the future of this collaboration on stage at CES, demonstrating how enterprises can navigate a complex web of decisions using the Mega Omniverse Blueprint.\n\n\u201cAt KION, we leverage AI-driven solutions as an integral part of our strategy to optimize our customers\u2019 supply chains and increase their productivity,\u201d said Rob Smith, CEO of KION GROUP AG. \u201cWith NVIDIA\u2019s AI leadership and Accenture\u2019s expertise in digital technologies, we are reinventing warehouse automation. Bringing these strong partners together, we are creating a vision for future warehouses that are part of a smart agile system, evolve with the world around them and can handle nearly any supply chain challenge.\u201d\n\nCreating Operational Efficiencies With Mega Omniverse Blueprint\n\nCreating operational efficiencies, KION and Accenture are embracing the Mega Omniverse Blueprint to build next-generation supply chains for KION and its customers. KION can capture and digitalize a warehouse digital twin in Omniverse by using computer-aided design files, video, lidar, image and AI-generated data.\n\nKION uses the Omniverse digital twin as a virtual training and testing environment for its industrial AI\u2019s robot brains, powered by NVIDIA Isaac, tapping into smart cameras, forklifts, robotic equipment and digital humans. Integrating the Omniverse digital twin, KION\u2019s warehouse management software can create and assign missions for robot brains, like moving a load from one place to another.\n\nThese simulated robots can carry out tasks by perceiving and reasoning in environments, and they\u2019re capable of planning next motions and then taking actions that are simulated in the digital twin. The robot brains perceive the results deciding the next action, and this cycle continues with Mega precisely tracking the state and position of all the assets in the digital twin.\n\nDelivering Services With Mega for Facilities Everywhere\n\nAccenture, global leader in professional services, is adopting Mega as part of its AI Refinery for Simulation and Robotics, built on NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, to help organizations use AI simulation to reinvent factory and warehouse design and ongoing operations.\n\nWith the blueprint, Accenture is delivering new services \u2014 including Custom Robotics and Manufacturing Foundation Model Training and Finetuning; Intelligent Humanoid Robotics; and AI-Powered Industrial Manufacturing and Logistics Simulation and Optimization \u2014 to expand the power of physical AI and simulation to the world\u2019s factories and warehouse operators. Now, for example, an organization can explore numerous options for their warehouse before choosing and implementing the best one.\n\n\u201cAs organizations enter the age of industrial AI, we are helping them use AI-powered simulation and autonomous robots to reinvent the process of designing new facilities and optimizing existing operations,\u201d said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture. \u201cOur collaboration with NVIDIA and KION will help our clients plan their operations in digital twins, where they can run hundreds of options and quickly select the best for current or changing market conditions, such as seasonal market demand or workforce availability. This represents a new frontier of value for our clients to achieve using technology, data and AI.\u201d\n\nJoin NVIDIA at CES.\n\nSee notice regarding software product information.",

Trade tensions are choking the movement of semiconductor products, manufacturing equipment, and other critical materials.\n\nThe ingenuity, resilience and flexibility of supply chain leaders worldwide will continue to be tested, but we can learn from the past. In addition to increasing the viability of current supply chain networks, logistics leaders must create more resilient and sustainable versions for the future. The year 2025 will see significant changes to global supply chain infrastructure \u2013 a necessity for the resilience of the nations and alliances that depend on it. AI may hold the key.\n\nThe widespread adoption of advanced technologies will catalyse the digitalization of supply chain management, change how products and services are made and delivered, and enable the sharing of supply chain information in new ways. Companies that pilot and apply emerging technology platforms to traditional management will realize the kind of optimization the industry has sorely needed.\n\nAt the procurement level, increased automation and advanced manufacturing will continue to reshape the labour force. Total sourcing costs, especially in industries suited for automation and in countries that have traditionally been the engines of global supply chains, will also be impacted. These shifts are likely to have several implications for procurement leaders:\n\nAltering the supplier base as some suppliers adopt new technologies while others are left behind.\n\nChanging the landscape of common labour-related issues in supply chains.\n\nFacilitating access to a massive volume of real-time supply chain information that is produced and validated by many supply chain actors.\n\nClimate change will also continue to affect supply chains and logistics. A 2024 study published in Nature Sustainability predicts that supply chains will face an increase in weather-induced disruptions over the next 15 years. While the exact effects cannot be precisely predicted, more frequent heat extremes and rainfall patterns are creating a continually shifting environment that impacts the production of raw materials in many countries.\n\nGeopolitical shifts also have the potential to transform the global business landscape, by creating an environment that is more complex and politically fraught. Tariffs and trade agreements, political relationships, subsidies, and export restrictions that affect trade routes and resource availability may have a significant impact on supply chains. There may be near-term damage if massive disruptions create chaos for businesses that rely on imports.\n\nLooking beyond 2025, direct challenges to global logistics and warehousing, as well as uncertainties about the durability of global trade agreements and norms, are destined to weaken the business models that gave rise to legacy global supply chain infrastructure. Fundamental changes are already taking place in the supply chain sector. Due to mixed signals in the global trade system and planned shifts in economic models, some companies are already reshoring, engaging in vertical integration, and increasingly drawing resources from new geographies.\n\nMany are hanging their hats on visibility into the future viability of global supply chain infrastructure. In 2023, as the world found itself at a pivotal juncture, the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Accenture and other key partners examined the Global Supply Resilience Initiative (GSRI) \u2013 a collective endeavour that was aimed at promoting resilience through increased visibility in supply chain operations. The resulting report outlines a pilot project undertaken by UNICEF in which it used real-time data to reinforce system performance and help save lives in West Africa.\n\nUsing advanced technologies, UNICEF was able to predict, respond and maintain resilient supply networks by harnessing shared data intelligence. The GSRI case study exemplified the role of open, non-competitive data exchange in bolstering supply chain resilience. It pointed to issues with organizational hesitation over data-sharing, and outlined how technological innovation and robust governance can encourage collective action for the greater good.\n\nIn 2024, KPMG reported that it was the year for \u201cthe supply chain digital shake-up\u201d. Advanced technologies have created a new paradigm where organizations can respond more quickly, proactively address problems, and reduce errors and inefficiencies with greater visibility, transparency, and traceability \u2013 all of which makes global supply chain infrastructure more resilient to future shocks and potential disruptions.\n\nFurther hammering home the importance of technological evolution, Gartner recently published its Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2025; it is a \u201cstar map\u201d for companies that wish to progress securely into the next five years and beyond, \u201cespecially as artificial intelligence upends the way technology is acquired, implemented and used in today\u2019s organizations\u201d.\n\nMost supply chain infrastructure actors now have a heightened awareness that they must up their game in our \u201cnew normal\u201d. Part of that means the adoption of AI solutions that will contribute to the assessment and reorganization of globalized supply chains. This should remove unnecessary complexities and mitigate vulnerabilities to the shocks and disruptions that have mercilessly plagued the industry. AI in the supply chain can revitalize individual companies' activity, while elevating the industry as whole. Let\u2019s champion supply chain innovation for the good of the global economy.",

            "content": "The UK tax collector has handed Accenture an additional \u00a335.2 million without competition on a \u00a370.4 million contract which was never tendered.\n\nIn a procurement notice published late last month, His Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said the global tech consultancy and services biz got the extra sum for \"additional works\" on the original contract, awarded in 2022.\n\nThe contract is for business application support and maintenance services for HMRC's National Insurance and PAYE System (NPS), which is part of the UK's critical national infrastructure, collecting 40 percent of revenues into HM Treasury with nearly 40,000 users in HMRC and the Department of Work and Pensions.\n\nThe system was first introduced in 2009, when Accenture provided application development and support services to the \u00a310 billion Aspire contract, a tech deal which also included Capgemini, Fujitsu and BT.\n\nIn 2016, HMRC said it would exit the Aspire deal \u2014 which originated in 2004 \u2014 that was scheduled close in 2017. Also in 2016, Accenture announced it had won a deal with HMRC to continue to support its applications, including the NPS.\n\nIn 2022, HMRC again awarded Accenture the contract for NPS support and development, valued at \u00a370.4 million, without competition.\n\n\"Due to the technical risk, age and intricate interdependencies of the NPS solution, the support services could currently only be provided by Accenture,\" the award notice said.\n\n\"In order to make the services suitable for competition in future and reduce vendor lock-in, the new contract includes modernization services which will deliver an 'NPS Disaggregation Programme.' This programme of work will disaggregate the NPS solution into six components to provide more open and independently maintainable business focused services,\" the notice said.\n\nThe \"disaggregation\" work appears more involved than initially thought.\n\nIn the most recent procurement award to Accenture, HMRC said the contract was increased by \u00a335.2 million without a new procurement procedure because there had \"been a significant increase in the project work which was not envisaged and catered for at the time of the direct award.\"\n\nIt said the enlarged contract fee would \"allow the continued provision of critical NPS services [and] support to major transformational projects and the continuation of the disaggregation program.\"\n\n\"A change of supplier is not feasible for technical reasons, as NPS has extremely high levels of technical and functional complexity. Accenture have managed these services for many years and have the in-depth knowledge of the HMRC NPS applications and business services and a change of supplier at this stage of the contract would put key services at serious risk,\" it said.\n\nThe duration of the contract is set to remain at five years from 2022.\n\nA spokesperson at HMRC sent a statement to The Register.\n\n\"All government contracts are awarded fairly and transparently, in line with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.\" \u00ae",

Despite the growing demand for GenAI-related services, clients are increasingly demanding that efficiency gains be passed on to them, creating a challenging pricing environment.\n\n\u201cPeople are spending more money on new technologies like GenAI, but we now have to do more for the same amount,\u201d said Venkatraman Narayanan, managing director and CFO, Happiest Minds.\n\nAlso Read AI in 2025: Transforming industries and empowering workforces\n\nNarayanan explained that as GenAI tools, such as copilot, enhance coding efficiency and reduce training time, clients are leveraging these advancements to demand greater value for their investments.\n\n\u201cFor example, if 20 people were previously required for a project lasting a year, the expectation now is that the same project can be delivered by 18 people due to efficiencies from generative AI,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, while GenAI commands a premium as a skill set, clients are resistant to higher prices, seeing the same resources capable of delivering more, he added.\n\nPareekh Jain, CEO, Pareekh Consulting, said, \u201cClients are asking IT companies to pass on whatever efficiency benefits they\u2019re getting from GenAI.\u201d While clients are willing to pay more for GenAI resources on a per-hour basis, they expect overall productivity gains to translate into significant cost savings, he added.\n\n\u201cFor instance, work that previously took 100 hours might now take 70 hours. Per-hour pricing may be increasing, but overall deal values are becoming margin-dilutive,\u201d Jain said. This trend is particularly evident during contract renewals, where clients push for expanded scopes at the same pricing or reduced deal values.\n\n\u201cYou can have the best pricing but still make low margins. Clients expect higher savings now, especially with GenAI. On renewals, they are coming with either the same scope at reduced values or increased scope at the same price,\u201d Jain added.\n\nThis increasing pricing pressure compels IT companies to pivot their strategies. Instead of relying on price hikes, firms are focusing on expanding customer relationships and increasing business volumes to sustain growth.\n\n\u201cThe demand side offers opportunities, but the supply side is witnessing an adjustment, with clients expecting companies to deliver more with fewer resources,\u201d Narayanan said.\n\nAlso Read How is India setting global standards for Contactless Biometric air travel?\n\nJulie Sweet, CEO, Accenture, also pointed to the competitive landscape during the company\u2019s recent post-earnings call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market, which is what we\u2019ve been saying every quarter, and we did see lower pricing across the business, which has been pretty consistent. Clients have constrained spending, particularly on small deals,\u201d she said.\n\nSweet further highlighted how Accenture is addressing these challenges by blending GenAI capabilities with initiatives to modernise. \u201cWe have the talent, the full-stack engineers, the GenAI, and a platform called GenWizard. Clients are coming to us not to take off old applications but to modernise while taking costs down.\u201d",

            "content": "CHICAGO \u2014 Snacks and confections giant Mondelez International has tapped Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon\u2019s infrastructure technology subsidiary, as its primary provider of cloud computing services.\n\nChicago-based Mondelez said the partnership will spur digital innovation across the company, with the AWS cloud infrastructure and services bringing more security, agility, cost efficiency and reliability to operations. The transition to AWS also is expected to bolster Mondelez\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, now being migrated to the SAP RISE platform powered by AWS.\n\nSo far, Mondelez said it has \u201calready migrated hundreds of workloads\u201d to the AWS cloud platform.\n\n\u201cA key focus of our growth strategy is our digital transformation,\u201d said Kostas Georgakopoulos, chief technology officer and chief information security officer at Mondelez. \u201cAWS is a strategic partner complementing our own internal cloud platform engineering capabilities to lead digital transformation across the enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe shift to AWS will accelerate the move to the SAP RISE ERP platform, which is expected to deliver improved performance, reliability, resiliency, security and AI functionality for business systems and insights, according to Mondelez.\n\nIn July, Mondelez\u2019s board of directors approved $1.2 billion in funding for a multi-year project to upgrade its global ERP and supply chain systems. Plans call for the new ERP platform to be implemented in several phases by region, with expenditures occurring over the next five years. The project is expected to be completed by year-end 2028. Mondelez is working with global IT and professional services firm Accenture on the ERP implementation, with AI-powered integrated planning system specialist o9 Solutions handling the supply and demand planning component.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the preparation we had been doing for the last 18 months positions us well in terms of successful execution,\u201d Mondelez chief financial officer Luca Zamarella said about the ERP project in a July 30 analyst call on second-quarter results. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to minimize all potential issues by going broadly in one region or by going broadly in the world on SAP. And we believe, given also the resources we have internally and importantly the ones we have secured through SAP and Accenture, that we will have a good opportunity to execute this well.\u201d\n\nBesides enhancing internal platform engineering abilities, the AWS partnership provides a cloud services suite that Mondelez said \u201caligns seamlessly\u201d with its focus on automation, security, resiliency and agility, which the company described as \u201ckey pillars\u201d of its strategic growth plan. AWS\u2019 focus on renewable energy and energy-efficient data centers also is expected to advance sustainability, Mondelez added.\n\n\u201cMondelez has a clear vision of how the cloud, AI and systems like SAP RISE can fuel its growth, and it is truly impressive to see the company execute on that vision,\u201d said Rich Geraffo, vice president of AWS North America. \u201cOur team is proud to have worked closely with their organization to implement the architecture, applications and services that will serve as a foundation for continued innovation across their company.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with AWS comes nearly five months after Mondelez announced the hiring of Filippo Catalano as chief information and digital officer, charged with accelerating the company\u2019s global technology and digital transformation. Catalano previously held the same role at health care brands company Reckitt. Mondelez noted that, while at Reckitt, Catalano led initiatives to \u201cre-platform\u201d the company\u2019s technology stack to boost omnichannel operations and implement AI, machine learning and advanced analytics platforms and solutions.",

            "content": "Corporate culture now sees people changing jobs every few years, but this longtime executive proves there\u2019s just as much to learn from spending a career in one place.\n\nAfter a 30-year tenure at consulting giant Accenture, formerly Arthur Andersen and Co., Larry Solomon chose to retire. But even then, he knew his career wasn\u2019t finished yet.\n\nThe South Jersey-based chief people officer took some time off to recalibrate and found himself starting a new challenge as chief people officer at software engineering service company EPAM Systems. He got to this point thanks to constant growth opportunities at Accenture.\n\nSolomon\u2019s degree is in finance and management information systems, but he didn\u2019t have a clear idea of what he wanted to do after graduating college. He started working at Arthur Andersen and Co. because he figured there would be more opportunities to try a variety of roles.\n\nHe was right. Solomon got opportunities to travel, join different teams and work on a range of projects. He bounced around from systems analyst to general management to operations to HR and recruiting.\n\nSolomon\u2019s experience in consulting allowed him to go where he was needed and try different roles at different companies. He said he learned it was more important to understand business before building up specialty skills in a specific department. Even though Solomon remained within the same company, he had to be a more flexible employee and gained new business skills.\n\nIn this edition of Technical.ly\u2019s How I Got Here series, Solomon discusses what kept him at Accenture for 30 years and how it led him to people management in his second act.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat is the benefit of staying with one company for so long?\n\nI held 10 different roles over that 30-year period. On average, I was in a different role every three years and some of the roles were very, very different.\n\nIt gave me a very well-rounded understanding of not only different cultures and different people but different parts of the business. In a large company that is diversified in nature, it\u2019s important to understand the different aspects of the global business.\n\nI had very different experiences across a 30-year period and did in fact prove that I can do different things and accommodate and adapt to different people and environments and different types of responsibilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s a specific challenge that stands out to you from 30 years at Accenture?\n\nIn the third trimester of my 30 years with Accenture, I was actually pulled out of HR and I was asked to become the COO of a large piece of Accenture\u2019s government and healthcare business.\n\nI didn\u2019t have the experience to be the COO at that time, but they thought I could grow into the role. After three months, the CEO left for long-term medical leave. When I\u2019m just starting to understand what\u2019s going on in this business, they\u2019ve now asked me to step up and take the interim CEO role.\n\nIt was an enormous challenge. I was also scared and I was nervous. I didn\u2019t let that get in the way, I made the decisions that I felt comfortable making. I asked for help and support when I wasn\u2019t comfortable and I needed some advice and some expertise. It was one of the best professional learning experiences in my career.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about being a chief people officer?\n\nThere\u2019s never a dull moment. There are constant challenges. There are no two situations that are exactly alike and dealing with people is, to some degree, a lot more challenging than dealing on the financial side.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand not only the professional side of an individual but also the personal side and the relationship side of an individual. In my role, there are lots of well-rounded and thoughtful decisions that I have to make every day that not only affect the business but affect the individual and the individual\u2019s family as well.\n\nWhat really keeps me going is just being surrounded by incredibly smart people in the company. You can never stop learning and I\u2019m learning something every week.\n\nHow has working in talent and people management changed over your career?\n\nWhen I started my career, the entire value proposition was, here\u2019s what I can do for you, the company, and I\u2019ll accept most or all of what the company was giving me, whether it\u2019s compensation or benefits. There was very little negotiation.\n\nI think that has flipped and companies have to be a lot more flexible, a lot more creative, a lot more focused on individual skills, wants and values. It\u2019s much more challenging now to not only attract but more importantly, retain people, especially in a hot market.\n\nIt\u2019s key that the company that offers the most flexibility has an edge. Flexibility in terms of compensation, benefits, structure, career path opportunities, traveling, geographic relocations and things of that nature.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone on a similar career path?\n\nFlexibility is very important. It has helped me enormously to be open to new ideas, new roles and working with different types of people, because we\u2019re in a very unpredictable world, and it\u2019s going to get more unpredictable going forward.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability and not taking things so personally are really important to be a well-rounded business leader.\n\nAnother thing is staying curious, asking questions, wanting to learn more and being hungry to learn new things. If you think you know it all, you\u2019re dead, because you don\u2019t.\n\nUnderstand the business that you\u2019re in. Make sure you understand how the company is organized, the history of the company, how it makes money, who its clients are and who its leaders are.\n\nEspecially when you\u2019re working in a people business, take the time to go the extra mile with your people. Take the time to do more than expected with your people.\n\nAt the end of the day, people are living human beings with wants and needs and desires and lots of stresses outside of their work life. It\u2019s important to understand and grasp what\u2019s going on with an individual to be able to get the most out of them in a business environment.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Accenture PLC's (ACN, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-02, Accenture PLC's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $254.18. It's currently trading at a price of $351.79. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -38.4%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Accenture PLC's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $12.28 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.54%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 11.20%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 124.02 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 88.92 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 254.18\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $327.23. This valuation indicates that the Accenture PLC is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -7.51%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Appointments, executive orders and budget battles will be the highlights. Expect chaos to be thrown into the mix as well.\n\nWe will watch the happenings that affect the government contracting community. Questions around opportunities and challenges will drive our coverage of the new administration.\n\nThe second Trump administration is not the only story from 2024 that will continue into 2025. Below is my list, but you should also read Ross Wilkers' take on the coming year as well.\n\nI read his before I wrote mine, so there will be some overlap. But we both bring our own perspectives as you see in Washington Technology each day.\n\nThe 2025 Top 100\n\nThis is another easy one, but we will likely see significant changes when the next annual rankings come out in June.\n\nHow far up will Amentum move from No. 21 after closing its merger with the Jacobs government services business?\n\nHow far will Jacobs fall from No. 18?\n\nJacobs' Next Chapter\n\nJacobs is looking to remain technology company at its core after that divestiture.\n\nThe Jan. 13 episode of our WT 360 podcast will feature my conversation with Shannon Miller, president of strategy, growth and digital at Jacobs. She will describe what this new era means for the company and its federal government work.\n\nCIO-SP4\n\nI love Ross\u2019 Fight Club analogy in his If, Then 2025 commentary.\n\nI do not have much to add, but a list of what to watch in 2025 is not complete without a mention of this contract. It will be interesting to see how the National Institutes of Health's IT acquisition arm digs itself out of this mess.\n\nGroundswell vs the Army, Accenture and SAP\n\nOn one level, this is a typical protest story. Groundswell and Accenture Federal Services both pursued a potential $1 billion contract to consolidate various business systems onto a single SAP-based platform. Accenture Federal won and Groundswell has filed a lawsuit to protest the award.\n\nI have to acknowledge that the only public documents available tell Groundswell\u2019s side of the story. But in reading those filings, it is clear that Groundswell challenging the status quo. The Army said it wanted to do something different but then made the award to Accenture Federal, the long-time incumbent.\n\nThis is the type of case that potentially could expose the sausage-making aspect of acquisition.\n\nOr it could be settled and just fade away.\n\nCarahsoft and the FBI search\n\nThe FBI raid on Carahsoft\u2019s headquarters captured attention and headlines for several days. Carahsoft has maintained business as usual. They are one of Washington Technology\u2019s biggest sponsors and we have continued to hold events at the conference center.\n\nCarahsoft says it is cooperating with investigators. Carahsoft also says the probe centers on a company they used to do business with.\n\nIt will likely be some time before the next public action, or that action may never come.\n\nSimilar to the Groundswell case, this one has the potential to teach us both the good and bad about how government procurement works.\n\nPeraton\u2019s New CEO\n\nStu Shea is the architect of Peraton, forming it into a coherent organization from a mis-mash of parts and pieces.\n\nShea's retirement leaves the next chapter to be written by his successor, Steve Schorer.\n\nOwned by private equity firm Veritas Capital, Peraton is the largest privately-held company on the Top 100 and hit position No. 11 for 2024.\n\nPeraton is almost certainly too large to be a takeover target of another Top 100 company.\n\nThe question I think everyone wants an answer to is how will Veritas exit. Will another private equity firm acquire the company? Will Peraton go public?\n\nMy money has always been on Peraton going public, which means the questions are about when and how?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if 2025 will be the year we get an answer, but perhaps we\u2019ll see some clues.",

Jabbar stated he had joined ISIS before this summer, Raia added.\n\nThe videos, which CNN has not reviewed, were posted on Jabbar\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday between 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m., Raia said. Jabbar also planted two improvised explosive devices in the hours before the attack, which took place about 3:15 a.m.\n\nJabbar was killed while exchanging fire with police after ramming the truck through the crowd in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. He had an ISIS flag in the truck he drove, according to local and federal authorities.\n\nFrom military vet to terrorism suspect\n\nNow, law enforcement authorities are reviewing the videos, as well as phones and laptops potentially linked to Jabbar, as they rush to piece in details about how he went from a military veteran to a suspect in a deadly rampage.\n\nHis family is also trying to understand where he went wrong. Jabbar was born and grew up in Beaumont, Texas, and his brother Abdur Jabbar, 24, and his father, Rahim Jabbar, 65, told CNN they couldn\u2019t reconcile the attack with the kind, soft-spoken person they knew.\n\n\u201cHe was very well-tempered, slow to anger,\u201d Abdur said in an interview in their home in Beaumont. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so unbelievable that he would be capable of something like this.\u201d\n\nAbdur, who spoke with his older brother almost daily over the last year and half, said he thought there must have been a mistake when a relative first told him Jabbar had been identified as the suspect. But then he saw his brother\u2019s face plastered on the news.\n\nThe brothers were raised Muslim and regularly attended a mosque on Friday nights while growing up, but Jabbar never spoke about ISIS or showed any signs of radicalization, Abdur said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never shared anything like that or of that nature with me,\u201d Abdur said. \u201cHe understood what it meant to be a Muslim\u2026 It wasn\u2019t this tragedy. It was the complete opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling us,\u201d Rahim added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going through something that we knew of.\u201d\n\nJabbar served in the Army for more than a decade, an Army spokesperson told CNN. He served as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist on active duty between March 2007 and January 2015, and deployed to Afghanistan once from February 2009 to January 2010, the spokesperson said. After leaving active duty in January 2015, Jabbar served in the Army Reserve until July 2020, when he left service as a staff sergeant.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar works in Fort Johnson (formerly Fort Polk), Louisiana, on November 16, 2013. 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division/Reuters\n\nServing in the military, Jabber said in a 2020 YouTube video pitching himself as a real estate agent, had taught him \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s to make sure that things go off without a hitch.\u201d The video has since been taken offline. In the video, he sat next to a framed poster with the word \u201cDiscipline\u201d in bold, and near a book titled \u201cLeadership.\u201d\n\nJabbar received an associate degree from Central Texas College in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in 2017, according to an online resume. Both degrees were related to computer science and information technology. He later worked in business development and data engineering at the consulting firms Deloitte and Accenture, according to the resume.\n\nGeorgia State University confirmed to CNN Jabbar attended from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems. Central Texas College and Accenture did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Deloitte said Jabbar served in \u201ca staff-level role since being hired in 2021.\u201d The company is assisting in the investigation and \u201cwe are shocked to learn of reports today that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJabbar obtained in 2019 a real estate license that expired in 2023, according to records from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The records show he took a range of real estate classes on topics such as contract law and finance between 2018 and 2021. He is also listed in public records as having previously registered or being associated with several companies in Texas and Georgia.\n\nContentious divorces and run-ins with the law\n\nJabbar had divorced twice, court documents show. His first wife sued him in 2012 over child support soon after he filed for divorce, and the court ordered him to pay amounts that increased over the years as his income grew. The case was dismissed in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, a Texas judge granted Jabbar\u2019s second wife a restraining order against him during their divorce case. The order mandated Jabbar to refrain from threats, physical harm, or other stipulated behavior against his ex-wife and either of their children. It required her to avoid the same behavior. In a court filing, Jabbar\u2019s ex-wife stated the marriage had become \u201cinsupportable because of discord or a conflict of personalities.\u201d\n\nJabbar had previously had several run-ins with the law. Harris County court records also show that he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft of between $50 and $500 in December 2002, and served nine months of \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he pleaded guilty to charges related to driving under the influence while serving at Fort Bragg, a North Carolina military base, now known as Fort Liberty, according to court records. The documents revealed Jabbar was under the influence of an impairing substance in November 2014 and recorded a blood alcohol level over the legal limit. They also showed that he was driving with \u201can open container of alcoholic beverage after he consumed alcohol.\u201d\n\nJabbar was charged with Level 5 DWI \u2013\u2013 the least severe level of the offense in North Carolina. According to the documents, he had his driver\u2019s license suspended, was placed on probation for 12 months, fined $200 and complied with 24 hours of community service.\n\nThe FBI released Shamsud-Din Jabbar's passport photo. FBI\n\nIn recent years, Jabbar appears to have struggled with his finances. In a January 2022 email filed as part of his divorce case, he wrote that he could not afford a mortgage payment on his house, which he said was more than $27,000 past due and \u201cin danger of foreclosure\u201d if his divorce settlement was further delayed.\n\nJabbar also stated in the email that a business he had formed, Blue Meadow Properties, had lost about $28,000 the prior year, and that other businesses he formed weren\u2019t worth any money. He added that he had incurred about $16,000 in credit card debt.\n\nA rented truck\n\nJabbar rented the truck he used in the New Year\u2019s attack, a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, on the car rental website Turo, which lets owners rent their vehicles to other people. The truck\u2019s owner confirmed to CNN in a text message that it was rented on Turo.\n\nJabbar picked up the truck on December 30 before driving from Houston to New Orleans the following day, Raia said. Mumtaz Bashir, a neighbor of Jabbar\u2019s in Houston, told CNN he saw Jabbar load up the truck on the morning of December 31, and that Jabbar told him he was moving to New Orleans for a new job.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he needs hands for moving, help him out, as a neighbor, do you need any help moving things around? He said, \u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019\u201d Bashir said. Jabbar appeared to be loading light, handheld items into the truck, he said.\n\nBashir, who said he was shocked and \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the attack, described Jabbar as a nice but quiet person who minded his own business. Bashir said he never saw any kind of \u201cred flag\u201d that Jabbar had been radicalized.\n\nThe rental site was also linked to an incident in Las Vegas involving a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside a Trump Hotel Wednesday. The driver of the Cybertruck died in the explosion, police said. Authorities have not confirmed the name of the dead driver and are investigating whether the incident was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d a Turo spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTuro disabled the truck linked to the New Orleans attack for renting on Wednesday morning. Before it was disabled, the vehicle was listed as costing $105 a day, excluding taxes and fees, and it was unavailable to rent until 12:30 p.m. central time on Wednesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera, Ashley Killough, Evan Perez and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story was updated to include new information on the suspect.",

The attack is being investigated as terrorism.\n\nAt least 15 people are dead, and dozens more were injured, after the attacker drove a truck into crowds on Bourbon Street at about 3:15 a.m. on New Year's Day. Two police officers were shot but are in stable condition.\n\nThe FBI said an ISIS flag, as well as weapons and a \"potential\" improvised explosive device, was found in the Ford F-150 pickup truck used in the attack.\n\nIt added that IEDs were found in the French Quarter, and the agency is investigating whether Jabbar had connections to terrorist organizations.\n\nLouisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, told NBC News that multiple people were involved and that they had rented a house on Airbnb.\n\n\"There was a house fire in New Orleans this morning that was connected to this event where we believe the IEDs were being made,\" she added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a press conference that hours before the attack, Jabbar posted videos \"inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill.\"\n\nJabbar's criminal record, obtained from the Texas Department of Public Safety and viewed by Business Insider, shows two arrests from 2002 and 2005.\n\nThe first was for theft of $50 to $500. The other was for driving with an invalid license. Both were classified as misdemeanors.\n\nAn FBI assistant special agent, Alethea Duncan, said in a press conference that the FBI did not believe Jabbar acted alone. She did not specify how many additional suspects the agency was investigating.\n\n\"We are aggressively running down every lead, including those of his known associates,\" Duncan said. \"We're asking anyone who has information, video, or pictures to provide it to the FBI.\"\n\nShe later added that Jabbar was an Army veteran and that the FBI believed he was honorably discharged.\n\nUS military spokespersons told media on Wednesday evening that Jabbar served in the Army from 2007 to 2015, during which he was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010.\n\nHe filled information-technology and human-resources roles at the time and was later an IT specialist in the Army Reserve from 2016 to 2020. He left the military as a staff sergeant.\n\nJabbar graduated from Georgia State University in 2017 after studying IT, according to an online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reviewed by CNN.\n\nSean Keenan, a freelance journalist, reported for The New York Times that he had interviewed Jabbar in 2015 for Georgia State University's newspaper. Jabbar told Keenan that he had difficulty adjusting back to civilian life \u2014 particularly with getting used to nonmilitary speech.\n\n\"You may have a lot of skills and training from the Army,\" Jabbar said in the article. \"But you may not be able to speak the language to really translate it and be understood when you apply for a civilian job.\"\n\nHe also said that bureaucracy in the Department of Veterans Affairs meant he might not receive his benefits if he made small mistakes on his paperwork.\n\nCiting Jabbar's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, CNN said he worked at Deloitte and Accenture, two of the biggest consultancies. A Deloitte spokesperson told BI in a statement that he worked in a \"staff-level role\" since his hiring in 2021.\n\n\"We are shocked to learn of reports today that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\" the Deloitte statement said. \"Like everyone, we are outraged by this shameful and senseless act of violence and are doing all we can to assist authorities in their investigation.\"\n\nAccenture did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJabbar also had a real estate license in Texas from 2019 to 2023. He took classes in real estate from 2018 to 2021, per the Texas Real Estate Commission.\n\nCiting court documents, CNN said he had been divorced twice, though The New York Times reported him he had only separated from his second wife.\n\nHis second wife had a temporary restraining order against him, which was granted in 2020, CNN said.\n\nThe Times said Jabbar and his first wife divorced in 2012. Dwayne Marsh, her new husband, said that she had forbidden her and Jabbar's two daughters from seeing him and that he had started acting strangely in recent months.\n\nJabbar's brother, Abdur, told the outlet that Jabbar had grown up as a Christian but converted to Islam many years ago.\n\n\"What he did does not represent Islam,\" the brother said. \"This is more some type of radicalization, not religion.\"\n\nChris Pousson, an Air Force veteran who went to school with Jabbar and reconnected with him in 2015, told the outlet that he remembered Jabbar as \"quiet, reserved, and really, really smart.\"\n\nJabbar was always polite and well dressed, he said, and though he noticed Jabbar writing increasingly religious posts on Facebook around 2015, the latest news was \"a complete 180 from the quiet, reserved person I knew.\"\n\nTuro, a car-sharing company, confirmed to BI that Jabbar used a truck rented through its app to carry out the attack and that it's \"actively partnering with the FBI.\"\n\n\"We are not currently aware of anything in this guest's background that would have identified him as a trust and safety threat to us at the time of the reservation,\" a Turo spokesperson said.\n\nThe attack came ahead of three major events in New Orleans, including the college football Sugar Bowl game, which was scheduled for January 1. Officials said it was postponed 24 hours.\n\nThe city also has its annual Mardi Gras festivities starting on January 6 and the 59th Super Bowl scheduled for February 9.",

The other was a US Army special forces sergeant from Colorado on leave from active duty.\n\nLaw enforcement officials on Thursday said there appears to be no definitive link between the two deadly events: a truck attack in New Orleans that left at least 15 dead and the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas that killed the driver and injured seven.\n\nBut in addition to the military backgrounds of the suspects \u2014 they both served in Afghanistan in 2009 \u2014 on the day of the attacks they shared at least one other striking similarity: Both men used the same rental app to obtain electric vehicles.\n\nThe driver of the Cybertruck was identified as Matthew Alan Livelsberger of Colorado Springs. He rented the Cybertruck on Turo, the app also used by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the suspect in the separate attack in New Orleans hours earlier. Turo said it was working with law enforcement officials on the investigation of both incidents.\n\nThere are \u201cvery strange similarities and so we\u2019re not prepared to rule in or rule out anything at this point,\u201d said Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nThe gruesome assault on revelers celebrating New Year\u2019s in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter and the explosion in Las Vegas thrust US domestic security back into the spotlight just weeks before Donald Trump is sworn in as president.\n\nThe incidents, which are being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompted statements from Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has often blamed undocumented immigrants for crime in the US and suggested as much in a social media post early Wednesday. Trump, in a social media post later on Thursday, blamed \u201cRadical Islamic Terrorism and other forms of violent crime.\u201d\n\nTexas Roots\n\nAs authorities combed through the macabre scene on Wednesday in New Orleans\u2019 historic French Quarter, they said they discovered an ISIS flag with the Ford F-150 electric pickup truck that barreled through the crowd. Two improvised explosive devices were found in the area, according to the FBI.\n\nJabbar had claimed to join ISIS during the summer and pledged allegiance to the group in videos posted on social media prior to the attack, according to the FBI. An official said there\u2019s no evidence that ISIS coordinated the attack.\n\nOfficials said the 42-year-old Jabbar, who lived in the Houston area, exchanged fire with police and was killed at the scene.\n\nJabbar has said online that he spent \u201call his life\u201d in the Texas city, with the exception of 10 years working in human resources and information technology in the military, according to a video promoting his real estate business.\n\nAfter serving as an active-duty soldier from 2006 to 2015 and as a reservist for about five years, Jabbar began a career in technology services, the Wall Street Journal reported. He worked for Accenture, Ernst & Young and Deloitte.\n\nJabbar was divorced twice, most recently from Shaneen McDaniel, according to Fort Bend County marriage records. The couple, who married in 2017, had one son, and separated in 2020. The divorce was finalized in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe marriage has become insupportable due to discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation,\u201d the petition stated.\n\nMcDaniel kept the couple\u2019s four-bedroom home southwest of Houston. She declined to comment when contacted at her house in suburban Houston.\n\nFort Bragg\n\nJabbar moved to another residence in Houston, which the FBI and local law enforcement spent all night searching before declaring the neighborhood of mobile homes and single-story houses safe for residents. Agents cleared the scene shortly before 8 a.m. local time without additional comment.\n\nJabbar\u2019s mobile home is fronted by an 8-foot corrugated steel fence that was partially torn apart to provide search teams access. Weightlifting equipment and a bow hunting target were scattered across the broken concrete walkway. Chickens, Muscovy ducks and guinea fowl roamed the property.\n\nBehind the home, a yellow 2018 Jeep Rubicon sat with its doors left wide open and a hardcover book written in Arabic sitting atop the dashboard. The license plate expired in May 2023.\n\nThe other suspect, Livelsberger, was a member of the Army\u2019s elite Green Berets, according to the Associated Press, which cited unidentified Army officials. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks, and was on approved leave when he died in the blast.\n\nLivelsberger, 37, spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that\u2019s home to Army special forces command. Jabbar also spent time at Fort Bragg, though his service apparently didn\u2019t overlap with Livelsberger\u2019s.\n\nLas Vegas Sheriff McMahill said they found his military identification, a passport, a semiautomatic, fireworks, an iPhone, smartwatch and credit cards in his name, but are still uncertain it\u2019s Livelsberger and are waiting on DNA records.\n\n\u201cHis body is burnt beyond recognition and I do still not have confirmation 100% that that is the individual that was inside our vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe individual in the car suffered a gunshot wound to his head prior to the detonation of the vehicle.\n\n(Updates with comments from law enforcement throughout.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "(CNN) \u2014 The Texas man who police suspect of killing at least 10 people celebrating New Year\u2019s in New Orleans and injuring dozens more is an Army veteran who has worked in real estate and IT and said in court documents that he struggled with financial troubles in recent years.\n\nLaw enforcement officials identified 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US citizen from Texas, as the suspect who they believe drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. Jabbar, who was killed while exchanging fire with police, had potential improvised explosive devices and an ISIS flag in the truck, according to local and federal authorities.\n\nJabbar was born in Beaumont, Texas, he said in a 2020 YouTube video titled \u201cPersonal Introduction,\u201d in which he pitched himself as a professional real estate agent based in Houston.\n\nAuthorities said Jabbar served in the US Army, although officials did not immediately confirm details about his service. A 2013 US Army Facebook post identified Jabbar as an Army Staff Sergeant who worked as an information technology team chief for the 82nd Airborne Division\u2019s 1st Brigade Combat Team at the time.\n\nServing in the military taught Jabbar \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s to make sure that things go off without a hitch,\u201d he said in the YouTube video, which has since been taken offline. He sat in the video next to a framed poster with the word \u201cDiscipline\u201d in bold, and near a book titled \u201cLeadership.\u201d\n\nJabbar received an associate degree from Central Texas College in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in 2017, according to an online resume. Both degrees were related to computer science and information technology. He later worked in business development and data engineering at the consulting firm Deloitte, according to the resume.\n\nGeorgia State University confirmed to CNN Jabbar attended from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s of business administration in Computer Information Systems. Central Texas College and Deloitte did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nJabbar obtained a real estate license in 2019, and the license expired in 2023, according to records from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The records show he took a range of real estate classes on topics such as contract law and finance between 2018 and 2021. He is also listed in public records as having previously registered or being associated with several companies in Texas and Georgia.\n\nThe mother of two of Jabbar\u2019s children sued him in Harris County, Texas in 2012 over child support, court records show. The court issued orders for Jabbar to pay amounts that increased over the years as his income grew, and that his employers withhold income for the children\u2019s support. The documents listed his employer as the US Army in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina in 2012 and Indianapolis in 2013, as well as the company Accenture LLP in Houston in 2018. The case was dismissed in 2022.\n\nHarris County court records also show that Jabbar pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft of between $50 and $500 in December 2002, and served nine months of \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Jabbar appears to have struggled with his finances. In a January 2022 email filed as part of his divorce case, he wrote that he could not afford a payment on his house, which he said was more than $27,000 past due and \u201cin danger of foreclosure\u201d if his divorce settlement was further delayed.\n\nJabbar also stated in the email that a business he had formed, Blue Meadow Properties, had lost about $28,000 the prior year, and that other businesses he formed weren\u2019t worth any money. He added that he had incurred about $16,000 in credit card debt.\n\nJabbar appears to have rented the truck he used in the New Year\u2019s attack, a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, on the car rental website Turo, which lets owners rent their vehicles to other people. The truck\u2019s owner told CNN in a text message that it was rented on Turo.\n\nTuro did not respond to a request for comment, but the site disabled the truck for renting on Wednesday morning. Before it was disabled, the vehicle was listed as costing $105 a day, excluding taxes and fees, and it was unavailable to rent until 12:30 p.m. central time on Wednesday.\n\nThis is a developing news story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest details.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

            "content": "(CNN) \u2014 In a series of videos, the man responsible for the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans discussed planning to kill his family and having dreams that helped inspire him to join ISIS, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more, posted five videos on Facebook in the hours and minutes leading up to the attack, Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nJabbar, a Texas-born US citizen and Army veteran who served in Afghanistan, made reference in the videos to his divorce and how he had at first planned to gather his family for a \u201ccelebration\u201d with the intention of killing them, two officials who had been briefed on the recordings said.\n\nBut Jabbar said in the videos he changed his plans because he wanted news headlines to focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said. Jabbar stated he had joined ISIS before this summer, Raia added.\n\nThe videos, which CNN has not reviewed, were posted on Jabbar\u2019s Facebook page Wednesday between 1:29 a.m. and 3:02 a.m., Raia said. Jabbar also planted two improvised explosive devices in the hours before the attack, which took place about 3:15 a.m.\n\nJabbar was killed while exchanging fire with police after ramming the truck through the crowd in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. He had an ISIS flag in the truck he drove, according to local and federal authorities.\n\nFrom military vet to terrorism suspect\n\nNow, law enforcement authorities are reviewing the videos, as well as phones and laptops potentially linked to Jabbar, as they rush to piece in details about how he went from a military veteran to a suspect in a deadly rampage.\n\nHis family is also trying to understand where he went wrong. Jabbar was born and grew up in Beaumont, Texas, and his brother Abdur Jabbar, 24, and his father, Rahim Jabbar, 65, told CNN they couldn\u2019t reconcile the attack with the kind, soft-spoken person they knew.\n\n\u201cHe was very well-tempered, slow to anger,\u201d Abdur said in an interview in their home in Beaumont. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was so unbelievable that he would be capable of something like this.\u201d\n\nAbdur, who spoke with his older brother almost daily over the last year and half, said he thought there must have been a mistake when a relative first told him Jabbar had been identified as the suspect. But then he saw his brother\u2019s face plastered on the news.\n\nThe brothers were raised Muslim and regularly attended a mosque on Friday nights while growing up, but Jabbar never spoke about ISIS or showed any signs of radicalization, Abdur said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never shared anything like that or of that nature with me,\u201d Abdur said. \u201cHe understood what it meant to be a Muslim\u2026 It wasn\u2019t this tragedy. It was the complete opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling us,\u201d Rahim added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going through something that we knew of.\u201d\n\nJabbar served in the Army for more than a decade, an Army spokesperson told CNN. He served as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist on active duty between March 2007 and January 2015, and deployed to Afghanistan once from February 2009 to January 2010, the spokesperson said. After leaving active duty in January 2015, Jabbar served in the Army Reserve until July 2020, when he left service as a staff sergeant.\n\nServing in the military, Jabber said in a 2020 YouTube video pitching himself as a real estate agent, had taught him \u201cthe meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s to make sure that things go off without a hitch.\u201d The video has since been taken offline. In the video, he sat next to a framed poster with the word \u201cDiscipline\u201d in bold, and near a book titled \u201cLeadership.\u201d\n\nJabbar received an associate degree from Central Texas College in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Georgia State University in 2017, according to an online resume. Both degrees were related to computer science and information technology. He later worked in business development and data engineering at the consulting firms Deloitte and Accenture, according to the resume.\n\nGeorgia State University confirmed to CNN Jabbar attended from 2015 to 2017 and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems. Central Texas College and Accenture did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Deloitte said Jabbar served in \u201ca staff-level role since being hired in 2021.\u201d The company is assisting in the investigation and \u201cwe are shocked to learn of reports today that the individual identified as a suspect had any association with our firm,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJabbar obtained in 2019 a real estate license that expired in 2023, according to records from the Texas Real Estate Commission. The records show he took a range of real estate classes on topics such as contract law and finance between 2018 and 2021. He is also listed in public records as having previously registered or being associated with several companies in Texas and Georgia.\n\nContentious divorces and run-ins with the law\n\nJabbar had divorced twice, court documents show. His first wife sued him in 2012 over child support soon after he filed for divorce, and the court ordered him to pay amounts that increased over the years as his income grew. The case was dismissed in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, a Texas judge granted Jabbar\u2019s second wife a restraining order against him during their divorce case. The order mandated Jabbar to refrain from threats, physical harm, or other stipulated behavior against his ex-wife and either of their children. It required her to avoid the same behavior. In a court filing, Jabbar\u2019s ex-wife stated the marriage had become \u201cinsupportable because of discord or a conflict of personalities.\u201d\n\nJabbar had previously had several run-ins with the law. Harris County court records also show that he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft of between $50 and $500 in December 2002, and served nine months of \u201ccommunity supervision.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, he pleaded guilty to charges related to driving under the influence while serving at Fort Bragg, a North Carolina military base, now known as Fort Liberty, according to court records. The documents revealed Jabbar was under the influence of an impairing substance in November 2014 and recorded a blood alcohol level over the legal limit. They also showed that he was driving with \u201can open container of alcoholic beverage after he consumed alcohol.\u201d\n\nJabbar was charged with Level 5 DWI \u2013\u2013 the least severe level of the offense in North Carolina. According to the documents, he had his driver\u2019s license suspended, was placed on probation for 12 months, fined $200 and complied with 24 hours of community service.\n\nIn recent years, Jabbar appears to have struggled with his finances. In a January 2022 email filed as part of his divorce case, he wrote that he could not afford a mortgage payment on his house, which he said was more than $27,000 past due and \u201cin danger of foreclosure\u201d if his divorce settlement was further delayed.\n\nJabbar also stated in the email that a business he had formed, Blue Meadow Properties, had lost about $28,000 the prior year, and that other businesses he formed weren\u2019t worth any money. He added that he had incurred about $16,000 in credit card debt.\n\nA rented truck\n\nJabbar rented the truck he used in the New Year\u2019s attack, a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, on the car rental website Turo, which lets owners rent their vehicles to other people. The truck\u2019s owner confirmed to CNN in a text message that it was rented on Turo.\n\nJabbar picked up the truck on December 30 before driving from Houston to New Orleans the following day, Raia said. Mumtaz Bashir, a neighbor of Jabbar\u2019s in Houston, told CNN he saw Jabbar load up the truck on the morning of December 31, and that Jabbar told him he was moving to New Orleans for a new job.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he needs hands for moving, help him out, as a neighbor, do you need any help moving things around? He said, \u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019\u201d Bashir said. Jabbar appeared to be loading light, handheld items into the truck, he said.\n\nBashir, who said he was shocked and \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the attack, described Jabbar as a nice but quiet person who minded his own business. Bashir said he never saw any kind of \u201cred flag\u201d that Jabbar had been radicalized.\n\nThe rental site was also linked to an incident in Las Vegas involving a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside a Trump Hotel Wednesday. The driver of the Cybertruck died in the explosion, police said. Authorities have not confirmed the name of the dead driver and are investigating whether the incident was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cWe are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d a Turo spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTuro disabled the truck linked to the New Orleans attack for renting on Wednesday morning. Before it was disabled, the vehicle was listed as costing $105 a day, excluding taxes and fees, and it was unavailable to rent until 12:30 p.m. central time on Wednesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera, Ashley Killough, Evan Perez and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            "content": "The editors at Solutions Review have compiled this list of the best SQL courses on Coursera to consider taking.\n\nSQL (short for structured query language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and is designed for managing data held in a relational database management system. The language is most useful for handling structured data and offers advantages like the concept of accessing many records with one single command and eliminating the need to specify how to reach a record over older read-write APIs.\n\nWith this in mind, we\u2019ve compiled this list of the best SQL courses on Coursera if you\u2019re looking to grow your skills for work or play. Coursera is one of the top online education platforms in the world, partnering with more than 200 universities and companies to provide a range of learning opportunities.

The agreement pushes the loan\u2019s maturity to Nov. 2, 2026, with an optional 12-month extension contingent on specific terms and conditions, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe original three-year loan, initiated in November 2020, comprised $281.3 million in term debt and $93.7 million in revolving debt. At the time the loan matured, KBS secured a short-term extension to Dec. 4, 2023.\n\nThe outstanding principal balance of the loan was $306 million as of Dec. 20, 2024.\n\nCEO Marc DeLuca also shored up $16 million to the balance, signaling a strengthened financial position to support the property. The extension and increased capital will offer KBS better financial stability as it navigates broader industry challenges.\n\nEarlier this year, the company dealt with significant troubles, including a $2.7 million embezzlement case involving its former chief auditor, and the surrender of an 18-story office building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District to its lender.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nAccenture Tower was built in 1987 and spans 1.5 million square feet. The building is connected to the Ogilvie Transportation Center, providing direct commuter rail access.\n\nThe firm recently invested $10 million in renovations, including an expanded lounge, outdoor terrace, and new conference center, aiming to enhance tenant appeal amid a challenging office market. These renovations, along with speculative suite buildouts, have helped the property achieve 95 percent occupancy.\n\nConsulting firm Accenture, the building\u2019s namesake tenant, occupies 260,000 square feet after expanding its lease in 2019.\n\nWhile KBS was able to secure a necessary extension, the situation highlights the difficulties office landlords face in refinancing debt due to changing market conditions and lender requirements.\n\nThese challenges are most evident with KBS Realty Advisors\u2019 real estate investment trust, which recently sold its last office asset in Houston for $17.6 million, marking a 63 percent discount. The property was sold to New Jersey-based Capital Commercial Investments, as part of its liquidation plan. The sale followed a failed transaction with Red River Asset Management, which defaulted on the purchase agreement, leading to the forfeiture of an $800,000 deposit. The REIT had been struggling with financial instability, including a $350 million decline in portfolio value, attributed to the pandemic and downturns in the oil market\n\n\u2014 Andrew Terrell",

This translates to an additional $957 billion, or 15% of the gross value added, to India\u2019s economy.\n\nHowever, the skill gap remains a significant barrier. According to IBM\u2019s Augmented Work for an automated, AI-driven world report, 40% of the workforce needs to reskill to keep pace with AI adoption over the next three years. Considering this situation, organisations must devise a reskilling plan to equip their workforce to harness the potential benefits of AI and use new-age technologies effectively.\n\nUpskilling is a cultural shift, not just technical training\n\nShefali Sharma Garg, VP- People Success, Publicis Sapient, emphasizes that reskilling requires cultivating learnability as a core competency. She rightly points out that reskilling beyond technical training demands a cultural shift toward continuous learning and adaptability in an AI-driven economy.\n\n\u201cLeveraging AI-powered tools like chatbot assistants, we simplify access to a diverse ecosystem of learning resources. These tools can empower individuals to design personalised learning journeys tailored to their unique career aspirations.

She suggests initiatives like internal hackathons to inspire team members to explore how AI can improve productivity, streamline tasks, and create practical solutions for the organization. \u201cThis includes the introduction of business chatbot use cases for effortless and accurate Q&A, automating data entry through data and deliverable automation, and using AI-powered document verification (AI data check) to simplify document comparison and verification processes,\u201d Rekha explains.\n\nFocus on soft skills\n\nSheenam Ohrie, Managing Director, Broadridge, India, highlights that alongside technical expertise, soft skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence will remain crucial.\n\nProblem Solving and Critical Thinking: As automation takes over routine tasks, the ability to break down existing complex business processes will be in high demand.\n\nEmotional Intelligence: Jobs requiring empathy, relationship-building, and nuanced human interaction will become more important.\n\nCollaboration with Technology: Developing the skills to effectively work alongside AI systems and optimize their capabilities will be a key competency.\n\n\u201cTo thrive in 2025 and beyond, embracing the challenge of reskilling will empower us to shape a future where humans and AI technologies work together to achieve unprecedented success. Hence, building a culture of continuous learning, customised training programs, public-private partnerships, and mentorship and coaching are strategies to be considered,\u201d adds Sheenam.\n\nHow to lead the change\n\nThe skill gap between current abilities and future requirements is increasingly widening, and without action, organisations are at risk of not being relevant to stakeholder needs.\n\nSunil Yadav, Distinguished Engineer, Dell Technologies, highlights the importance of skill gap analysis to understand where the workforce stands and what the future demands. \u201cOrganisations should assess current skills, identify evolving needs, and outline clear development paths to prepare employees for upcoming opportunities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sunil, fostering a growth mindset and communicating with the team is a must. \u201cChange often comes with resistance, but a growth mindset helps employees adapt and embrace transformation. Also, leadership must communicate a clear vision of how reskilling will benefit the organisation and its people, using all available internal platforms to amplify the message.\u201d\n\nPersonalised development strategies, and aligning learning opportunities with team members\u2019 interests and skill levels through mentoring, coaching, and tailored training ensure meaningful progress, Sunil suggests.\n\nTo address the skill gap in an AI-driven economy, it becomes imperative for organisations to champion a culture of continuous learning and upskilling, and if employees want to remain competitive in a strong market, skill-building and training will need to take center stage. \u201cInnovative learning programs, curated learning experiences, and nurturing curiosity are the need of the hour,\u201d says Rajasekar Rajagopal, Assurance Leader \u2013 EY Global Delivery Services.\n\nFor Rajasekar, upskilling isn\u2019t just a strategic move, it's a human one. \u201cIt's about investing in our people, showing them,they're appreciated, and ensuring that our workforce evolves alongside the technological landscape, keeping us all moving forward together.\u201d\n\nTo succeed in the AI-driven economy of 2025, organisations must embrace a holistic approach to reskilling and upskilling their workforce, combining technical expertise with strategic thinking and adaptability. Partha Sengupta, Managing Director and India GCC Head, Nielsen, believes in fostering a culture of continuous learning where teams are well-versed in AI technologies like deep learning, and generative AI to enhance content analysis and predictive modelling.\n\nSengupta suggests, leveraging AI-driven platforms to identify skill gaps, tailor training journeys, and track progress ensures effective learning outcomes. \u201cPartnerships with academic and industry leaders enrich our training programs, ensuring access to cutting-edge knowledge and certifications. Furthermore, our reskilling initiatives underscore ethical AI principles such as transparency and bias mitigation, enabling employees to implement AI responsibly.\u201d\n\nThe skill gap is widening, but organisations that act now can turn this challenge into an opportunity. Building a culture of continuous learning, leveraging AI-driven tools, and investing in both technical and soft skills are the keys to thriving in the AI-driven economy of 2025 and beyond.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has become a dominant force in the stock market, driving the performance of top companies and capturing the attention of major investors. Insider Monkey's Q3 data reveals that 15 of the 20 companies most favored by hedge funds are deeply involved in AI, reflecting its growing influence across industries. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include tech giants leading the AI revolution, remain the most widely held by hedge funds, highlighting their central role in shaping market trends.\n\nThe AI boom continues to surge, fueled by companies not just adopting but spearheading advancements in this transformative technology. As valuations for AI-driven stocks climb to unprecedented levels, the sustainability of this rally comes into question. Can the sector\u2019s rapid growth justify its soaring price tags, or is a market correction inevitable? Investors remain on edge, closely monitoring the balance between innovation and valuation.\n\nThe AI Revolution: Perspectives from Industry Titans\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the \u201cAI computing ramp\u201d as being in its early stages, with years of growth ahead, predicting AI-driven advancements in fields like science and healthcare. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz highlighted how AI is enabling both cybercriminals and cybersecurity efforts, calling it the future \u201cbattle of AI.\u201d Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy emphasized generative AI\u2019s role in democratizing enterprise data, noting ongoing collaborations and a robust AI product pipeline.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su discussed the competitive semiconductor market, stating that different computing architectures are needed for AI\u2019s diverse applications and stressing that AI\u2019s full impact will unfold over the years.

According to the Bloomberg report, AI Needs So Much Power, It\u2019s Making Yours Worse, the U.S. power grid is facing growing challenges from \"bad harmonics,\" which occur when electrical wave patterns deviate from the ideal. These distortions can damage home appliances, increase fire risks, and signal deeper grid issues. Data shows that households near data centers experience more severe harmonics, with over half of homes with the worst distortions located within 20 miles of major data center activity. In areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers dominate, the proportion of homes experiencing high harmonic distortions exceeds the national average fourfold.\n\nStory Continues",

Industry insiders said private-equity buyers would also most likely remain active.\n\n\"Everyone is looking for the glue that ties together some of the components,\" said Charles Ping, a managing director of the Winterberry Group management consultancy.\n\nBI talked to about a dozen advertising, marketing, and adtech industry executives, investors, bankers, and advisors, who speculated about the deals they think could happen in 2025 and beyond. Some of the people were granted anonymity to protect business relationships; their identities are known to BI.\n\nAccenture could go revenge shopping\n\nMatt Lacey, a partner at the M&A advisory group Waypoint Partners, said the combination of Omnicom and IPG may leave Accenture feeling vulnerable. Its Accenture Song creative marketing group could look to acquire a new asset in areas like data and media, \"where it has limited capabilities,\" he said.\n\nBrian Wieser, an analyst at Madison and Wall, wrote in a recent note to clients that Accenture Song was arguably the \"world's largest marketing services business\" \u2014 at least until Omnicom and IPG come together. Wieser noted that it marked \"high single-digit growth\" in its most recent quarter, faster growth than its agency-holding-company peers.\n\nAccenture has been a consistently active acquirer of advertising and marketing businesses in recent years. In April it acquired the customer-engagement agency Unlimited to boost its customer-relationship-management offering. In June it bought the Brazilian creative agency Soko.\n\nDavid Droga, the CEO of Accenture Song, is expected to be an active acquirer again in 2025. John Lamparski/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York\n\nAnother area of interest for Accenture Song is experiential marketing, a person familiar with its strategy told BI.\n\n\"Experiential is going to be hot in 2025,\" this person said. \"The sheer fact that people are coming out and younger generations don't just want to be in a digital world, they want social connections. You can do a significant amount of innovation in the integration between tech and real-world settings.\"\n\nAppLovin could swoop in for deals while its stock is riding high\n\n\"Everyone is looking at AppLovin,\" said Alex Iosilevich, a partner at Alignment Growth, which invests in media and entertainment companies. \"The expectation is they'll be acquisitive.\"\n\nAppLovin's stock has been soaring, and it's been trading at a market value above $100 billion. Investors have been wowed by its move into e-commerce, which has opened up a new and lucrative pool of advertisers beyond its mobile-gaming roots.\n\nWhile AppLovin's executives have said M&A isn't part of the company's near-term growth strategy, that hasn't stopped industry insiders from speculating about its next move.\n\nAppLovin, which went public in April 2021, is expected to use its recent stock-market tear to its advantage. Nasdaq\n\n\"I think they should buy someone like Snapchat and get a foothold in the social space,\" said Alex Merutka, a former early AppLovin employee who's now the CEO of the adtech company Craftsman+.\n\nOther ad industry insiders said AppLovin could further expand into connected TV, adding to its 2022 acquisition of Wurl, a company that helps publishers distribute and monetize their video content on TV screens.\n\nConnected TV presents a \"massive area to unlock SMB budgets to play in TV ads,\" said Tom Triscari, the CEO of the programmatic-advertising advisory firm Lemonade Projects.\n\nRelated stories\n\nCriteo could be bought or go shopping itself \u2014 or both\n\nCriteo has long been the subject of takeover speculation. Reuters reported in early 2023 that the company had appointed the investment bank Evercore to explore its strategic options.\n\nNews that Criteo's CEO, Megan Clarken, plans to exit the company next year also fueled rumors that a sale could be in the cards. Digiday listed The Trade Desk, Microsoft, Walmart, Publicis Groupe, and WPP's GroupM as logical suitors.\n\nMegan Clarken, the CEO of Criteo, plans to exit the company next year. Criteo\n\nTriscari said it could be equally possible that Criteo itself makes a transformative acquisition.\n\n\"Criteo has retail media, the second-best shopper dataset to Amazon, and better adtech than Amazon,\" Triscari said. \"All they need is an access point to CTV inventory. Very doable with some creative options out there.\"\n\nCriteo might also want to double down on retail-media tech. Digiday reported this summer that Criteo had been in talks to acquire Skai, a marketing platform that specializes in retail search advertising, among other things. The Israeli news site Calcalist reported this month that Skai recently laid off 80 employees, which could signal that the company is preparing for a sale.\n\nHavas listing could spur deals\n\nThe French advertising group Havas listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam this month, separating from its parent company, Vivendi.\n\nHavas has said it will continue taking a \"disciplined approach to acquisitions,\" with a plan to target high-growth markets and areas like data analytics, digital transformation, and AI.\n\n\"They look at everything right now,\" Ritchie, of WY Partners, said.\n\nYannick Bollor\u00e9, the CEO of Havas, has said the French ad firm wants to make more acquisitions following its recent stock-market listing. Stephane Cardinale-Corbis/Getty Images\n\nHavas had a busy 2024 with the acquisitions of the data firm DMPG, the B2B marketing company Ledger Bennett, the Australian media agency Hotglue, and the social-media agency Wilderness, among others.\n\nIAS could get taken private\n\nBI reported last month that KKR and other private-equity buyers were weighing a deal to acquire the publicly traded ad-verification firm Integral Ad Science. KKR and IAS declined to comment at the time.\n\nBloomberg first reported that IAS had appointed the investment bank Jefferies to explore its options after receiving inbound takeover interest.\n\nA take-private deal could help IAS grow further without the quarterly Wall Street scrutiny.\n\nIAS, led by CEO Lisa Utzschneider, has been fielding inbound interest from private-equity firms. Integral Ad Science\n\nSpeaking generally about the adtech industry, Ping, of Winterberry, said, \"There are many companies that don't have access to the capital that they imagined they would when they listed, and it's hampering their growth, particularly if they have a global outlook.\"\n\nHe added that take-private deals could unlock new capital while offering some value back to shareholders. Ping pointed to Mediaocean's $500 million acquisition of the CTV advertising and analytics firm Innovid and to the advanced-TV ad company Cadent's $324 million acquisition of the performance marketing company AdTheorent as recent examples of this trend.\n\nPE-backed independent agency groups could make big moves\n\nJay Pattisall, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, said the consolidation of Omnicom and IPG could open up more opportunities for private-equity-backed independent ad agencies like Dept, Horizon Media, PMG, Tinuiti, and Wpromote.\n\n\"Anticipate more growth in independents' innovation investments and more focus in their proposition to compete with the global consolidation of marketing scale at Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP,\" Pattisall wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nAccording to the advisory firm SI Partners, private-equity and private-equity-backed transactions were responsible for about a third of deal volume in the agencies, consultancies, and technology-service-provider sectors in the year to mid-November.\n\nThe Netherlands-based digital ad agency Dept, led by Dimi Albers, is expected to be on the hunt for further investment next year. Dept\n\nSome might seek new investors, given where they are in their private-equity investment life cycles.\n\nDept, which sold a majority stake to Carlyle Group in 2020, is expected to be in the market for a new investor next year, industry sources told BI.\n\nThe US media agency Horizon Media could also be in play, since Temasek, the investment firm that bought a minority share in 2021, will want an exit at some point, said Dave Morgan, the executive chairman of the TV-ad-buying company Simulmedia. Last month Horizon added a full-service creative agency to its ranks, hinting at ambitions to become a bigger global network.\n\nTalent agencies like CAA, Wasserman, and UTA will be jockeying for influencer experts\n\nM&A insiders said talent agencies were gearing up to make deals to broaden their offerings beyond traditional talent management.\n\nInfluencer specialists are at the top of their shopping lists, these people said.\n\n\"You have this melding \u2014 where does influencer live in the context of things like TikTok Shop or Instagram?\" said Bob Morris, a managing partner of the M&A advisory firm Bravery Group. \"We hear over and over that talent agencies are looking for different models and sets of mechanics.\"\n\nTalent agencies like UTA, led by Jeremy Zimmer, are expected to look for bolt-ons in areas like influencer marketing and data. Vianney Tisseau/Variety via Getty Images\n\nTalent agencies are also looking to become more data-centric to identify which influencers drive sales, Morris said. Adobe Analytics said influencers and other affiliate marketers drove about 20% of US Cyber Monday e-commerce revenue this year.\n\nThere are plenty of interesting targets on the market. In 2024, 17 creator-focused startups raised at least $10 million in new funding, totaling over $900 million.\n\nCould The Trade Desk buy Roku?\n\nThe Trade Desk this year announced a coming connected-TV operating system called Ventura, which it said was designed to make the buying and selling of streaming TV ads more efficient.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAhead of the launch, The Trade Desk's CEO, Jeff Green, batted off speculation that it planned to rival Roku, saying it wanted to continue to partner and not compete with the TV platform.\n\nThe Trade Desk, led by Jeff Green, hasn't been an active acquirer. Could that change in 2025? Greg Doherty/Variety via Getty Images\n\nIn separate notes to investors, analysts at Guggenheim and Needham said they thought it was likely that The Trade Desk could eventually acquire Roku to advance its TV ambitions.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to build these\" TV platforms now, the Needham analyst Laura Martin said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. Roku has 85 million homes watching four hours of TV a day on average, which would open up a large engaged audience and lots of first-party data to The Trade Desk's advertisers.\n\nAll eyes are on WPP's next move\n\nWPP was already licking its wounds after Publicis Groupe hired Snoop Dogg to help promote that it had become the world's largest advertising holding company. The coming together of the third- and fourth-biggest firms, Omnicom and IPG, is set to push WPP further down the pile.\n\n\"It will put even more pressure on Mark Read,\" WPP's CEO, said David Jones, the CEO of a rival ad firm, The Brandtech Group. \"And it will bring renewed interest from the investor community.\"\n\nWPP insiders and observers had speculated for more than a year that the company might be taken private by a private-equity firm or that it might announce its own merger with another holding company.\n\nBut some industry insiders now think it's more likely that divestitures are in the cards.\n\n\"I think WPP is too big of a buy to go private, but I think they will have a divestiture plan that they are going to execute on in areas that are not high performing and not sexy enough for the public markets,\" said Andreas Roell, the CEO of Evros Group, which advises on media deals. Case in point: WPP in August sold its majority stake in FGS Global to the private-equity firm KKR in a deal that valued the public-affairs and communications group at $1.7 billion.\n\nAdAge reported that in a recent memo to employees, Read described the Omnicom-IPG deal as \"good news\" for WPP, adding that WPP would double down on its strategy around creativity, data, AI, and tech \"while our peers are distracted and turning inward.\"",

            "content": "Building the right organizational strategy by getting all teams together and modifying the role of human employees is the biggest roadblock to adoption of artificial intelligence by businesses, Harrick Vin, global chief technology officer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said in an exclusive interview with Mint.\n\nSpeaking about the core challenges in the enterprise adoption of AI and generative AI technologies, Vin said, \u201cOrganizations must design their AI strategy to balance value, complexity and risk. To do this, they need to get multiple teams together, which makes it a big challenge for the company itself, since each team will have different requisites and philosophies. But, for a cohesive AI strategy to become AI-mature, creating a common take is crucial,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThis is why the adoption of AI is not up to expectations. A relatively small percentage of use cases are actually going into production, because they\u2019re failing on not being engineered to a company\u2019s needs, or a company not knowing how to drive the organizational changes to take AI deployment from experiment to value-driven production.\"\n\nTo help improve this, Vin said that while TCS, India\u2019s largest software services company by market cap and revenue, continued to incrementally raise its research and development (R&D) expenditure, there is unlikely to be any exponential jump in this figure. In FY24, TCS spent \u20b92,751 crore on its R&D initiatives\u2014about 1.2% of its \u20b92.41 trillion annual net revenue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stayed around the 1.2% figure for a while, keeping our research expenditure consistent. It is difficult to project any change for the future\u2014right now, the magnitude of our investments is not limited by any arbitrary figure, but based on where we need to invest in R&D. We\u2019re constantly observing various industries, which helps us decide upon where and when to invest,\" Vin said.\n\nThe affirmation of TCS\u2019 R&D approach to address technical challenges comes against the backdrop of India looking to set up a target-linked incentives programme to help private sector companies increase R&D spending. The programme, senior government officials told Mint last week, is designed to help create technical patents and intellectual properties within India\u2014instead of licensing tech from overseas economies. In a proposal for a $3-billion incentives package to boost India\u2019s tech industry, up to $1 billion could be earmarked to boost private-sector technical R&D expenditure, Mint reported on 12 December.\n\nFocus on R&D to address AI challenges\n\nVin, meanwhile, said that TCS is using its R&D expenditure to develop solutions that make AI more palatable to enterprises.\n\n\u201cOur R&D approach is divided between the future of tech initiatives, and also the future of work. For the latter, there is knowledge work, and physical work. There\u2019s also the future of societal work that defines areas such as food, agricultural development, waste management and more. In physical work, we split our research into areas including the future of robots and robotic automation, and automation of factory operations,\" he said.\n\nHe also identified six key fields that defined technical innovation demand from enterprises through this year. \u201cWe have sensing technologies to collect and observe lots of data globally\u2014without data, there\u2019s no machine intelligence. The second is the rise of quantum and neuromorphic computing that brings brain-like computing power to the edge at nearly a hundredth the power consumption\u2014giving rise to us working towards a future where all computing will be hybrid. Data management and security is an obvious third, given all the threats. In communications, 6G technologies will set standards; in AI, knowledge management to upskill the future of our work is happening as we speak. Finally, new human-computer interfaces will become key as we work even more closely with machines,\" Vin added.\n\nAs an example of how such initiatives are playing out, Vin highlighted the ongoing project examples of using hyperspectral imaging, that is, data from satellites, to assist in city planning projects. Further, the presence of low-power processors and local AI models help connected cars gauge parameters to detect if a driver is fatigued.\n\nAll of this, Vin added, will depend on the evolution of AI models, and the human understanding of deploying the right models for the right use cases.\n\n\u201cTraditional AI models are inherently more predictable, explainable and efficient, since they are based on causality and logical reasoning, and are deterministic. Generative AI models, on the other hand, use analogical reasoning and correlational learning. The advantage of the latter is that it is inherently more adaptive than rule-based models\u2014on the other hand, they\u2019re non-deterministic and not explainable. A key challenge is to know when not to use generative AI, and also the right model to use. Agents, on this note, help determine the outcome of an ensemble of models, tally that with external environments, and drive outcomes. These agents are designed for change, failing which they can become obsolete quickly. From an engineering standpoint, this is why AI is a big challenge\u2014and thus akin to an art form today,\" he said.\n\nGenerative AI, despite its hype, is yet to create a major revenue impact for tech exporters. On 19 December, Accenture Plc reported $1.2 billion worth of generative AI bookings or orders. It has recorded $500 million in generative AI revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nWhile TCS disclosed 600 active generative AI projects in its September-quarter earnings press conference, a quarterly revenue figure wasn't shared.\n\nWith the current initiatives, TCS\u2019 AI revenue could swing upward\u2014even in the absence of accelerated R&D expenditure from the domestic tech bellwether.",
