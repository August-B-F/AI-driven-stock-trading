            "content": "Adobe has announced a major new round of updates to Premiere Pro and After Effects, just ahead of NAB 2025. The spotlight is on AI-driven tools designed to streamline workflows and support editors and motion designers\u2019 creative decisions \u2013 particularly a new feature called Generative Extend. Initially introduced in beta during Adobe Max in October 2024, Generative Extend has now been fully integrated into Premiere Pro with the release of version 25.2. These updates are part of Adobe\u2019s broader push to bring more automation and intelligence into the editing process.\u200b\n\nFirst, let\u2019s have a brief overview of what\u2019s new in Premiere Pro and After Effects before we go into detail:\n\nGenerative Extend lets you add up to two seconds of new footage to the start or end of a clip using Firefly AI \u2013 useful for smoothing transitions without reshoots.\n\nlets you add up to two seconds of new footage to the start or end of a clip using Firefly AI \u2013 useful for smoothing transitions without reshoots.

Color Management gets easier with drag-and-drop tools and automatic conversion of log/raw footage to SDR or HDR.\n\ngets easier with drag-and-drop tools and automatic conversion of log/raw footage to SDR or HDR. Plus: dynamic waveforms, colored labels, and better GPU support in Premiere Pro; and in After Effects, a faster playback engine, 3D FBX model support, and HDR monitoring.\n\nFirefly-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro\n\nThe most talked-about feature is Generative Extend, powered by Adobe Firefly. Editors can now add a few extra seconds (up to two) of generated video to the beginning or end of a clip \u2013 helpful for smoothing transitions or extending a moment that feels a little too short. The results match the look and motion of the original shot, and background audio, like room tone or ambient sound, can be extended as well (up to ten seconds).\n\nThe tool is built into the timeline, and results can be previewed and adjusted directly within the edit. It runs in the background while you continue editing, and clips are marked with Content Credentials to show where AI was used. It\u2019s free during the rollout but eventually will require Firefly credits, with costs based on the format, frame-rate, and resolution of the video.\n\nMedia search recognition. Image credit: Adobe\n\nAI-Powered media search\n\nAlso new is a smarter way to search through footage. A revamped Search panel now uses AI to tag clips automatically, recognizing things like objects, locations, camera angles, and more. Editors can type natural language queries \u2013 like \u201cclose-up of a woman laughing in a car\u201d \u2013 to find what they need faster, even in large, unsorted projects. The system can also pull up related transcript content and metadata like shoot date or camera type, all in one place. Searches run locally, so no internet is required. Adobe also points out that as with all of their tools, your content isn\u2019t used to train models.\n\nTranslate to 27 languages using AI. Image credit: Adobe\n\nAutomatic caption translation\n\nCaptions in Premiere Pro can now be automatically translated into 27 languages using AI. Multiple caption tracks can be viewed and edited directly in the timeline, making it easier to create multilingual content or localize videos for different regions or language groups.\n\nColor management updates\n\nPremiere\u2019s new Color Management tools are designed to make things simpler when working with log or raw formats. The software can now automatically convert clips to SDR or HDR, reducing the need for manual LUTs and helping match footage from different cameras. A new wide-gamut color pipeline is also available for editors who want more control over grading and color matching.\n\nAfter Effects \u2013 monitor in HDR. Image credit: Adobe\n\nPerformance upgrades under the hood\n\nAnd finally, some updates that make Premiere Pro faster and more reliable. Dynamic waveforms now update as you adjust audio levels, and sequence tabs can be color-coded for better organization. Editors on Apple silicon and newer Windows systems will see faster playback and export times, especially when working with H.264, HEVC, and Canon Cinema RAW Light. Adobe says they are also working with NVIDIA to support real-time playback and smoother timeline performance on GPUs built with the new Blackwell architecture.\n\nAfter Effects enhancements\n\nAfter Effects 25.2 brings major performance improvements and more streamlined 3D tools. A new high-performance preview system now uses both RAM and local disk caching, so longer compositions play back smoothly \u2013 even on laptops. Native support for FBX files opens access to a wider range of 3D models, while Animated Environment Lights make it possible to use video layers or 360\u00b0 footage as moving light sources that cast dynamic reflections and shadows. The update also includes HDR monitoring, simplified 3D workflows with one-click controls, and other small but useful tweaks like custom transparency grids and expanded animation controls.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nAll features are available now. You can update your Premiere Pro to 25.2 here and After Effects here. For further details and information on the 25.2 release, please see the Adobe announcement here. To see Generative Extend at this year\u2019s NAB 2025, visit Adobe\u2019s Booth SL2210 in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nWhat feature are you most interested in trying out?

            "content": "Adobe's ADBE short percent of float has risen 7.39% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 8.20 million shares sold short, which is 1.89% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.76 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nAdobe Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Adobe has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Adobe's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Adobe's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.12%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "Efficient reverse logistics is the backbone of any modern, efficient supply chain. With the growing focus on reducing costs, maximizing efficiency, and operating sustainably, reusable transport assets (RTAs) have emerged as a crucial investment for shippers to optimize supply chains.\n\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the global reverse logistics market is expected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2034, with the United States accounting for more than $253 billion of the global number. Without proper tracking and management of reusable transport assets, companies often find themselves grappling with inefficiencies, delays, and added expenses. That\u2019s why RTAs have the power to revolutionize the reverse logistics market for shippers.\n\nThe pain points of reverse logistics\n\nReverse logistics has always been a complex process for any business. Once goods are delivered to a customer or retailer, their return or redistribution introduces an entire new layer of shipping challenges. At the center of these challenges lies the issue of tracking RTAs, such as crates, boxes, pallets, and other reusable assets.\n\nToo often, shippers have little to no visibility into where their RTAs are located. For example, after delivering goods to retail stores, RTAs are frequently misplaced, left in backrooms, parking lots, or even discarded. Physically searching for RTAs at a facility is like searching for a needle in a haystack. When 3PLs or on-site teams must manually search warehouses, backrooms, or lots for untracked RTAs, hours are wasted. Shippers lose too much time and money chasing down missing assets while relying on incomplete or outdated manual processes.\n\nWithout real-time location tracking, shippers struggle to coordinate RTA pick-ups or ensure the availability of RTAs for returned assets. Carriers with empty trucks are dispatched multiple times just to retrieve missing assets. Instead of collecting all RTAs in one efficient trip, carriers may require two or three trips because they couldn't locate them during the first run. An easy-to-use wayfinding tool empowers shippers and third-party logistics (3PL) providers to seamlessly locate and utilize onsite RTAs.\n\nThe lack of visibility cascades into inconsistencies that hurt supply chain operations. A retailer might return RTAs from one location within days while another location holds onto them for months. The shipper, unable to predict asset turnover, is left with unreliable data, making it impossible to plan effectively for future shipments. Lack of visibility and inconsistent turnover often results in shippers either over-investing in RTAs to maintain buffer stock or facing delays due to insufficient assets.\n\nThese pain points reveal a shared frustration across the shipping industry\u2014without knowing where RTAs are, companies can\u2019t maximize their supply chain investments. Inefficient asset turnover may lead to disrupted deliveries, causing a ripple effect that impacts overall customer satisfaction. High-value, customized RTAs\u2014such as reinforced pallets for hazardous materials or temperature-sensitive goods\u2014represent substantial investments. The high turnover rate of RTAs, or lack thereof, directly correlates to operational efficiency. The more times an RTA can be reused within its lifecycle, the greater the return on investment.\n\nThe benefits of RTAs in reverse logistics\n\nInvesting in RTAs with tracking technology strengthens reverse logistics strategies and provides a competitive advantage. Shippers benefit from enhanced asset utilization through real-time tracking while reducing the need for surplus asset inventory. Cost-savings become operational and attainable, by minimizing transportation and labor costs across the board. Maximizing RTA reuse means fewer one-time-use materials like wooden pallets are discarded. This is both cost-effective and environmentally sustainable.\n\nReverse logistics, which often sees a spike during peak seasons like holidays, becomes faster and more streamlined for businesses. Shippers don\u2019t want their supply chain clogged up by idle transport assets, especially when the demand for speed is at its highest. However, the biggest competitive advantage above the rest is the greater ROI that shippers see on RTA investments. With reinforced pallets and specialized crates costing millions of dollars in some cases, ensuring the efficient utilization of smart RTAs maximizes the value of every investment.\n\nHow smart technology works to optimize RTAs\n\nSmart technology has revolutionized the ability to monitor RTAs in real-time. Location tracking technology plays a pivotal role in managing reverse logistics effectively. This technology allows shippers to see the exact location of their RTAs across the country\u2014or even globally\u2014on a dashboard. This \"bird\u2019s-eye view\" ensures shippers know the whereabouts of every asset, whether it's in use, in transit, or sitting idle. Once a 3PL or carrier arrives at a retail location to pick up RTAs, Bluetooth technology helps locate the specific assets needed. Just like following a blue dot on a mobile map, employees can pinpoint the RTA location down to the exact aisle or corner of a warehouse.\n\nIn addition, smart technology provides more than just real-time location data. It monitors impact (detecting drops or shocks), tilt (indicating mishandling), temperature, and humidity. This data is particularly critical for temperature-sensitive or condition-sensitive goods. Shippers also proactively receive notifications when RTAs are sitting at sites for too long and which customers use RTAs in effective ways. This is where data and analytics become powerful decision-making tools that further drive operational efficiency.\n\nSmart devices can function for over five years and are built to endure harsh industrial environments. Low power consumption and the ability to remotely update firmware ensure long-term reliability and minimal maintenance. This technology gives shippers an advantage to reduce (or even eliminate) manual processes, optimize asset reuse, and ensure higher accuracy in their logistics operations.\n\nRTAs power the future of reverse logistics\n\nThe name of the game in reverse logistics is speed, efficiency, and reliability. With RTAs and advanced tracking technology, any company can turn a traditional pain point into a modern reverse logistics masterpiece. Whether you\u2019re shipping electronics, managing hazardous materials, or simply looking to enhance your pallet operation, the adoption of smart RTAs is a crucial step for shippers aiming to bring logistics in-house and optimize reverse logistics.",

            "content": "Adobe is rolling out several new features for Premiere Pro and After Effects. Announced on Wednesday, these features will be showcased at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show 2025 in Las Vegas. The company says it took feedback from professional editors and motion designers and is now introducing artificial intelligence (AI) workflow features and improvements to its platforms. Most notable is the Generative Extend feature in Premiere Pro, which will allow users to extend clips using Firefly-generated footage in 4K resolution.\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro Gets Generative Extend\n\nIn a blog post, the company detailed the new features which are currently rolling out to both Premiere Pro and After Effects. Apart from Generative Extend, Premiere Pro is getting an AI-powered search panel, the Premiere Colour Management tool, and auto translation capabilities.\n\nGenerative Extend feature in Adobe Premiere Pro\n\nPhoto Credit: Adobe\n\nThe Generative Extend feature was first unveiled by Adobe last year, and is now rolling out to users. It is powered by the company's native Adobe Firefly video generation AI model. The feature enables users to extend their clips with additional AI-generated 4K frames. Users can add a text prompt to generate desired footage and audio. The company says this will offer editors more options for transitions and compensate for unexpected cuts and movements without having to reshoot.\n\nGenerative Extend can add up to two seconds of video clips or up to ten seconds of ambient background audio. The two modalities can be paired for two seconds of footage. The tool cannot add or extend music or speech.\n\nFor a limited time, Generative Extend will be available for free to Premiere Pro users, Adobe said. After that, creating AI-generated clips will cost Firefly generative credits, where the amount of credits will depend on the format, frame-rate, and video resolution. Users can get a monthly allocation of credits between 25 to 1,000 with Creative Cloud subscription plans. In India, a Creative Cloud subscription for Adobe Premiere Pro is priced at Rs. 733.96 a month.\n\nNew Search Panel in Adobe Premiere Pro\n\nPhoto Credit: Adobe\n\nAnother introduction is a new AI-powered search panel along with Media Intelligence technology. The tool enables editors to find the desired clip from the library using a natural language search query. Adobe says the tool can recognise objects, locations, camera angles, and more.\n\nAdditionally, users can also search for visuals, spoken words, or embedded metadata such as shoot data or camera type. It is an on-device feature, so users do not require an Internet connection to search for footage. The company says users' data is not used to train AI models.\n\nAdobe is also adding the Premiere Colour Management tool to Premiere Pro. It is an easy-to-use colour management tool that adds colour profiles to log and raw camera footage. There are six presets that editors can quickly select from, or use the customisation setting to play around with a wide range of options. Further, Premiere Pro is also getting the capability to automatically translate video captions into 27 languages using AI.\n\nAfter Effects is also getting some significant improvements. With the new High Performance Preview Playback feature, the platform now uses the computer's RAM and local disks together to re-cache compositions, essentially allowing users to preview their entire composition without long wait times. It is also getting improvements in making 3D compositions and HDR monitoring.",

            "content": "Introducing new AI-powered features and workflow enhancements in Premiere Pro and After Effects 25.2\n\nAt NAB 2025, we are delivering new versions of both Premiere Pro and After Effects with AI workflow features and dozens of improvements pro editors and motion designers have asked for. In Premiere Pro, you can extend clips with Firefly-powered Generative Extend in 4K. New Media Intelligence helps you find the right clip in seconds. Captions can now be translated automatically in over 27 languages to reach a global audience. And you can get started faster than ever with drag-and-drop color management. Other top workflow improvements in Premiere Pro 25.2 include dynamic waveforms, colored sequence labels, additional GPU accelerated format support, and more. We\u2019ve also released After Effects 25.2 with a new high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools, and stunning HDR monitoring.\n\nPremiere Pro\n\nFirefly-powered Generative Extend in 4K\n\nIt happens to all of us. Sometimes the camera starts too late or cuts too soon, leaving you with a great moment that\u2019s just a little too short. Now, Generative Extend can save the day by adding a few extra frames to your clip to achieve the perfectly timed edit.\n\nPowered by Adobe Firefly, Premiere Pro will seamlessly add extra 4K frames so you have enough media to cover transitions, hold on an emotional reaction for an extra beat, or add in missing ambient sounds and/or room tone. Generative Extend works in the background while you continue to edit and clips are marked with Content Credentials so viewers know where AI was used.\n\nYou can try Generative Extend now at no cost. After a limited time, Generative Extend will consume Firefly generative credits. The price will vary based on the format, frame-rate, and resolution of your video. Please check the Adobe website for detailed information.\n\nFly through hours of footage and find clips fast with AI\n\n\n\nWith AI-powered Media Intelligence and an all-new Search panel, you can now search hours of footage in seconds. The content of your clips is automatically recognized, including objects, locations, camera angles, and more. Use natural language search terms to describe anything you want and matching clips will be found instantly. You no longer need to create string outs with your selects, mark sequences and clips, or rely on your memory of the shoot to find what you need.\n\nAnd you can find visuals, spoken words in dialog, or embedded metadata such as shoot date or camera type \u2014 all at the same time, in one place. You can hover over thumbnails, scroll through multiple transcripts, and edit straight into the timeline from the panel.\n\nYou can search footage for descriptive terms like \u201cclose-ups of hands working in a kitchen\u201d or \u201coverhead shots of plates of food\u201d and see relevant moments I can quickly scrub through or load in the Source monitor. Or I can search for \u201ccacao\u201d and find related visuals, transcript mentions, and embedded metadata with shoot location all in one place!\n\nMedia analysis is fast and happens on your own system, so you don\u2019t need an internet connection to use it. And as with all our AI-powered tools, your content is never used to train any AI models.\n\nTake the guesswork out of color management\n\nOne of the toughest technical challenges of video editing is normalizing your log and raw video clips so you can start your creative work. With Premiere Color Management, we\u2019ve made it simple to import and get right to editing with great-looking footage. No more dealing with washed out, grey-looking log video.\n\nPremiere Pro now transforms your original log and raw camera files directly to SDR or HDR \u2013 without needing LUTs. It works automatically for most camera formats as soon as you import your footage. If you\u2019re working with select formats, proxies, or log content you purchased online, it\u2019s easy to tag the appropriate color space for batches of clips right from your bins.\n\nAdditionally, Premiere Color Management provides you with a new wide-gamut color pipeline using industry-standard ACEScct as your working color space. With our new color pipeline, Premiere can utilize all the log and raw data of your source clips for more dynamic range and control for color grading in Lumetri. It makes matching multiple cameras, perfecting skin tones, and dialing in the mood and tone of your videos more flexible and fun than ever before.\n\nBest of all, Premiere Color Management is simple for any video editor to use. When making a new sequence, adjusting sequence settings, or working in the settings tab of your Lumetri panel, all you need to do is select one of six new color management presets. If you\u2019re a color expert, there\u2019s a wide range of settings to customize based on your needs.\n\nThe default preset, Direct Rec.709, gives you a color pipeline similar to previous versions of Premiere Pro so your legacy projects open and look as expected. To unlock the capabilities of our new wide-gamut color pipeline, simply select any of the three new \u201cWide Gamut\u201d presets.\n\nAuto-translate captions in 27 languages\n\nAfter we introduced Text-Based Editing in 2023, we heard the community loud and clear: captions are critical, and translations are a must. Now we\u2019re fulfilling this top request so you can automatically translate your captions into 27 languages with AI. Captions have become increasingly important for accessibility and engagement on social media. Reach more viewers, followers, and customers to grow your global community without leaving Premiere Pro.\n\nPlus, you can have multiple caption tracks visible at the same time to display various languages or even assist you through editing in a different language.\n\nPremiere Pro is even faster & more performant than ever\n\nWe know that speed and reliability is critical in your day-to-day work as an editor. We\u2019ve been working hard on more top requests for our community and improving Premiere Pro under the hood to make it faster than ever, including:\n\nDynamic waveforms that grow and shrink as you make volume adjustments to give you a visual representation of your audio level.\n\nSequence label colors that help you stay organized by adding color to sequence tabs.\n\nCompletely rewritten support for H.264 in MP4 and MOV provides up to a 4x increase in performance on Apple silicon computers and a 2x increase in performance on Windows.\n\nHardware-accelerated Canon Cinema RAW Light on Apple silicon computers, so playback on the timeline is up to 4x faster and export is up to 9x faster.\n\nFaster audio conform and peak file generation that\u2019ll get you started faster and keep you working smoothly.\n\nPlus, we\u2019ve been working with NVIDIA to introduce faster than real-time playback for popular formats including H.264 and HEVC 10-bit 4:2:2. Editors using Premiere Pro (beta) with newer Windows systems get GPU-powered decode acceleration using NVIDIA Blackwell GPU Architecture. That means working with camera originals instead of proxies, smoother timeline responsiveness, and reduced CPU load, freeing system resources for multi-app workflows and creative tasks.\n\nAfter Effects\n\nPlay back your entire comp on any computer without the waiting\n\nFor years, the amount of work you could play back in After Effects has been dependent on the amount of RAM in your computer. This made it difficult to preview longer compositions without pausing and waiting for After Effects to re-cache, especially on laptops.\n\nHigh Performance Preview Playback changes that forever.\n\nIt\u2019s a new caching system that utilizes your computer\u2019s RAM and local disks together, so After Effects can cache and preview your entire composition. It\u2019s one of the biggest performance improvements in the history of After Effects. Now any user, on any computer, can play back more of their comp than ever.\n\nMake realistic 3D animations in fewer clicks\n\nAfter Effects users have been asking us for more 3D tools to enhance their motion design and VFX compositing capabilities. Not only are we releasing more tools, we\u2019re making 3D faster, easier, and more fun for any 2D motion designer or video editor to start using.\n\nWith new Animated Environment Lights, you can wrap your 3D comp with moving light made from any video or animation. Use your background plates, 360-degree videos, selected layers, or even an entire comp to illuminate your 3D models with reflections and shadows that move.\n\nYou can now use 3D FBX models natively in After Effects, making millions more 3D models available for you to use. FBX is a popular 3D model format commonly used in online marketplaces.\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve condensed many advanced and multi-step 3D workflows into new one-click menu items. Now you can create a 3D background environment that moves with your camera or shade your 3D model with custom effects in just a single click.\n\nMonitor your work in HDR\n\nIn addition to importing and exporting HDR content in After Effects, we\u2019re thrilled to introduce new HDR monitoring. Whether you\u2019re working on an HDR-enabled laptop or transmitting your video signal to an HDR reference monitor, you can now view new levels of vibrance, saturation, and brightness in After Effects.\n\nMore to love in After Effects 25.2\n\nWhile all our new features in After Effects come directly from professional motion design and video editing communities, these ones are the little things that matter a lot to the users who animate and composite in After Effects frequently.\n\nCustom fallow colors and transparency grids\n\nNew preference to maintain workspaces when opening projects from another user\n\nNew null commands for precise animation control\n\n3D model animation controls in the Properties Panel\n\nAvailability\n\nAll these features are available now.

            "content": "For those Nikon users who prefer to use Adobe Premiere for your workflow, a major new compatibility announcement should make your life quite a bit easier.\n\nNikon, the brand on which I built the still photography portion of my career, has been making major inroads into the video market in recent years with both advancements in their own technology and the acquisition of RED Cinema Cameras last year. One minor\u2014but major\u2014hiccup has been that their excellent N-RAW video format has been unavailable to Adobe Premiere users, forcing them to either shoot in one of the H.264/H.265 or ProRes formats when using cameras like the Z9, Z8, or Z6 III, or having to switch their editing platform to something like Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, which has been able to edit N-RAW video since launch.\n\nThis could be critical, as the N-RAW format offers 12-bit files in a wider Rec. 2020 color gamut, giving you a great deal more flexibility during post-production. The change is another benefit of the recent marriage between Nikon and RED, as Premiere Pro support for the N-RAW format is the result of Nikon N-RAW support being added to RED\u2019s R3D SDK.\n\nThe change should open up the option of using Nikon cameras to a brand-new section of users. Likewise, N-RAW\u2019s inclusion could be a boon to longtime Nikon users like myself, allowing us to explore post-production solutions from Adobe in return.\n\nAdobe Premiere support for N-RAW files is expected to be included in an upcoming update from Adobe by the end of 2025.",

            "content": "Alongside the new Nikon Z5 II camera, Nikon announced that Adobe will introduce support for Nikon\u2019s efficient 12-bit N-RAW video format in an upcoming version of Premiere Pro later this year.\n\nN-RAW is a proprietary high-quality RAW video format that promises creators expansive video data without massive file sizes. The 12-bit format supports the Rec2020 color gamut and allows users to adjust the white balance in post-production, similar to tweaking the white balance in RAW photo files.\n\nWith Adobe Premiere Pro adding Nikon N-RAW support \u201cby the end of 2025,\u201d a much wider range of videographers and editors will be able to work with Nikon N-RAW video, which is available on many of Nikon\u2019s recent Z mirrorless cameras, including the Nikon Z8, Z9, Z6 III, and the new Z5 II.\n\nNikon has previously touted N-RAW\u2019s performance, including its balance between image quality and file size, but as PetaPixel has noted, widespread support in industry-standard non-linear video editors has been somewhat slow. Other than Premiere Pro, once the promised support arrives, video editors only have two options for editing N-RAW video: DaVinci Resolve and, more recently, REDCINE-X PRO.\n\n\u201cI think N-RAW can be helpful in any type of project, whether it be a documentary, a wedding film, or a corporate video, or whatever you\u2019re shooting,\u201d says cinematographer Mitch Blummer. \u201cI generally work with a colorist for many of my pieces but for this one, I was able to dial in the look and maintain consistent color throughout the scenes using the camera RAW controls that N-RAW enables.\u201d\n\nThe Premiere Pro support for the N-RAW format is directly related to Nikon\u2019s acquisition of RED. Nikon says that N-RAW support is possible thanks to the addition of N-RAW support to RED\u2019s R3D software development kit (SDK). Nikon\u2019s RED purchase has paid impressive dividends in only a year, including the addition of RED-developed N-Log LUTs.\n\n\u201cNikon will continuously meet the needs of those involved in video and film production, contributing to the development of imaging culture, with the hope of expanding possibilities for imaging expression,\u201d Nikon promises.\n\nAlthough a precise date for N-RAW support\u2019s arrival to Premiere Pro is not yet available, videographers may not need to wait too long to begin editing N-RAW footage in Adobe\u2019s popular video editing application.\n\nImage credits: Nikon, Adobe",

As investors remained cautious, scanning for signs of economic impact from potential tariffs, Adobe's positive developments in video editing technology may have struggled to buoy its stock performance.\n\nBuy, Hold or Sell Adobe?

            "content": "Plus, GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 laptops are out now, accelerating video editing and AI workflows.\n\nVideo editing workflows are getting a lot more colorful.\n\nAdobe recently announced massive updates to Adobe Premiere Pro (beta) and Adobe Media Encoder, including PC support for 4:2:2 video color editing.\n\nThe 4:2:2 color format is a game changer for professional video editors, as it retains nearly as much color information as 4:4:4 while greatly reducing file size. This improves color grading and chroma keying \u2014 using color information to isolate a specific range of hues \u2014 while maximizing efficiency and quality.\n\nIn addition, new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 laptops \u2014 built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture \u2014 are out now, accelerating 4:2:2 and advanced AI-powered features across video-editing workflows.\n\nAdobe and other industry partners are attending NAB Show \u2014 a premier gathering of over 100,000 leaders in the broadcast, media and entertainment industries \u2014 running April 5-9 in Las Vegas. Professionals in these fields will come together for education, networking and exploring the latest technologies and trends.\n\nShed Some Color on 4:2:2\n\nConsumer cameras that are limited to 4:2:0 color compression capture a limited amount of color information. 4:2:0 is acceptable for video playback on browsers, but professional video editors often rely on cameras that capture 4:2:2 color depth with precise color accuracy to ensure higher color fidelity.\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro\u2019s beta with 4:2:2 means video data can now provide double the color information with just a 1.3x increase in raw file size over 4:2:0. This unlocks several key benefits within professional video-production workflows:\n\nIncreased Color Accuracy: 10-bit 4:2:2 retains more color information compared with 8-bit 4:2:0, leading to more accurate color representation and better color grading results.\n\nMore Flexibility: The extra color data allows for increased flexibility during color correction and grading, enabling more nuanced adjustments and corrections.\n\nImproved Keying: 4:2:2 is particularly beneficial for keying \u2014 including green screening \u2014 as it enables cleaner, more accurate extraction of the subject from the background, as well as cleaner edges of small keyed objects like hair.\n\nSmaller File Sizes: Compared with 4:4:4, 4:2:2 reduces file sizes without significantly impacting picture quality, offering an optimal balance between quality and storage.\n\nCombining 4:2:2 support with NVIDIA hardware increases creative possibilities.\n\nAdvanced Video Editing\n\nProsumer-grade cameras from most major brands support HEVC and H.264 10-bit 4:2:2 formats to deliver superior image quality, manageable file sizes and the flexibility needed for professional video production.\n\nGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs paired with Microsoft Windows 11 come with GPU-powered decode acceleration in HEVC and H.264 10-bit 4:2:2 formats.\n\nGPU-powered decode enables faster-than-real-time playback without stuttering, the ability to work with original camera media instead of proxies, smoother timeline responsiveness and reduced CPU load \u2014 freeing system resources for multi-app workflows and creative tasks.\n\nRTX 50 Series\u2019 4:2:2 hardware can decode up to six 4K 60 frames-per-second video sources on an RTX 5090-enabled studio PC, enabling smooth multi-camera video-editing workflows on Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nVideo exports are also accelerated with NVIDIA\u2019s ninth-generation encoder and sixth-generation decoder.\n\nIn GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, the ninth-generation NVIDIA video encoder, NVENC, offers an 8% BD-BR upgrade in video encoding efficiency when exporting to HEVC on Premiere Pro.\n\nAdobe AI Accelerated\n\nAdobe delivers an impressive array of advanced AI features for idea generation, enabling streamlined processes, improved productivity and opportunities to explore new artistic avenues \u2014 all accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\n\nFor example, Adobe Media Intelligence, a feature in Premiere Pro (beta) and After Effects (beta), uses AI to analyze footage and apply semantic tags to clips. This lets users more easily and quickly find specific footage by describing its content, including objects, locations, camera angles and even transcribed spoken words.\n\nMedia Intelligence runs 30% faster on the GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU compared with the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU.\n\nIn addition, the Enhance Speech feature in Premiere Pro (beta) improves the quality of recorded speech by filtering out unwanted noise and making the audio sound clearer and more professional. Enhance Speech runs 7x faster on GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPUs compared to the MacBook Pro M4 Max.\n\nVisit Adobe\u2019s Premiere Pro page to download a free trial of the beta and explore the slew of AI-powered features across the Adobe Creative Cloud and Substance 3D apps.\n\nUnleash (AI)nfinite Possibilities\n\nGeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 Series laptops deliver the largest-ever generational leap in portable performance for creating, gaming and all things AI.\n\nThey can run creative generative AI models such as Flux up to 2x faster in a smaller memory footprint, compared with the previous generation.\n\nThe previously mentioned ninth-generation NVIDIA encoders elevate video editing and livestreaming workflows, and come with NVIDIA DLSS 4 technology and up to 24GB of VRAM to tackle massive 3D projects.\n\nNVIDIA Max-Q hardware technologies use AI to optimize every aspect of a laptop \u2014 the GPU, CPU, memory, thermals, software, display and more \u2014 to deliver incredible performance and battery life in thin and quiet devices.\n\nAll GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops include NVIDIA Studio platform optimizations, with over 130 GPU-accelerated content creation apps and exclusive Studio tools including NVIDIA Studio Drivers, tested extensively to enhance performance and maximize stability in popular creative apps.\n\nAdobe will participate in the Creator Lab at NAB Show, offering hands-on training for editors to elevate their skills with Adobe tools. Attend a 30-minute section and try out Puget Systems laptops equipped with GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPUs to experience blazing-fast performance and demo new generative AI features.\n\nUse NVIDIA\u2019s product finder to explore available GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops with complete specifications.\n\nNew creative app updates and optimizations are powered by the NVIDIA Studio platform.

Today, the company announced a big update that adds Firefly generative AI to the video editor, allowing you to do things like extend clips you\u2019ve shot and add captions faster than ever. The update also brings a new color correction feature to help give your footage the right look.\n\nPremiere Pro 25.2 comes with a new feature called Generative Extend. It allows you to take an existing 4K clip and drag it out a bit to extend its length, with each frame generated by Firefly AI. It\u2019s ideal for clips that feel just a tad too short, as you can only extend clips by up to two seconds. Audio can also be extended (besides voices and music), and if you just need more background noise without extra video, you can extend audio by up to 10 seconds.\n\nAdobe is also adding AI to search. Now, you can use Media Intelligence with the all-new Search panel to find the clips you need by using natural language queries. You could type \u201cclose up of food on plate\u201d or \u201cwoman riding motorcycle\u201d and it\u2019ll pop up. Premiere Pro will analyze the clips you add to your project (without the need for internet) and identify what\u2019s in them, allowing you to search for the right clip quickly without having to rely on your memory or other methods of organization.\n\nCaptions are also getting an AI upgrade. You can now automatically translate video captions into 27 different languages, which will undoubtedly save a ton of time for video editors working on multi-language projects.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new feature called Premiere Color Management that can automatically process your log and RAW video files with adjusted colors, giving you a starting ground to make color corrections as you see fit. It can automatically process them in SDR or HDR with the need for LUTs, and it supports most camera formats. You also get a new wide-gamut color pipeline to work with that uses an industry-standard color space.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Adobe says that Premiere Pro is faster than ever. Optimizations have been made to both the version for Windows devices and for those that use Apple silicon.\n\nThe Premiere Pro update is rolling out now. In order to use most of the AI features mentioned, Adobe will require you to spend Firefly credits that are available as part of your Creative Cloud plan. For a limited time, the features will remain free to use for all users.\n\nMax Buondonno is Editor at The Shortcut.

            "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAnother tech giant \u2014 Adobe \u2014 is scaling back its diversity hiring goals.\n\nAt an internal all-hands meeting on Monday, Adobe's chief people officer, Gloria Chen, said Adobe would no longer have diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring targets, internally dubbed \"Aspirational Goals,\" according to a recording of the meeting obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThese goals were set in 2020 to \"increase global diversity and inclusion\" at leadership levels, Adobe's company blog said. The goals included increasing female leadership representation to 30% globally, doubling underrepresented minorities in leadership roles, and doubling Black representation as a percentage of US employees by 2025.\n\n\"We will discontinue the practice of setting aspirational representation goals while continuing our focus on fair and consistent hiring practices,\" Chen said, adding Adobe had never actually hired based on such quotas.\n\nAdobe is the latest in a long list of companies, including Google, Meta, McDonald's, and Deloitte, to reduce its DEI initiatives. The change follows executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in January aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government and its contractors.\n\nIn an email to BI, Adobe's spokesperson said, \"We've always believed in and remain committed to Adobe for All, which is our belief in creating a company culture where all employees are empowered to make an impact. While some programs and policies are changing, our values are not.\"\n\n'Need more transparency'\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, Chen said executive orders could be \"complex\" to interpret and Adobe was \"evaluating\" many internal programs, activities, and practices to ensure the company complied with them.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nChen added that Adobe didn't believe the DEI pullback applied to countries outside the US for now. As of November, Adobe had a little over 30,000 employees worldwide, 50% of which were in the US, according to a company filing.\n\nAdobe also removed all diversity mentions in its latest proxy statement, a change first spotted by Michelle Leder, the founder of Footnoted, a site that analyzes Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Adobe mentioned diversity 22 times in the previous year's proxy. This year's proxy also deleted a chart on director diversity.\n\nSome Adobe employees shared their frustration in an internal Slack channel, according to screenshots seen by BI. One employee said Adobe's unique culture of embracing different perspectives, called Adobe for All, now seems \"lost.\" Another said it was \"heartbreaking\" and asked for additional guidance from the leadership team.\n\n\"I think we all need more transparency around this issue,\" one of the people said.",

            "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Adobe is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.39 = US$8.1b \u00f7 (US$30b - US$9.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2025).\n\nTherefore, Adobe has an ROCE of 39%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.7% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Return on Capital Employed April 1st 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Adobe compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Adobe .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Adobe Tell Us?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Adobe are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 39%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 30% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Adobe thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Adobe's ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Adobe is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 20% to shareholders. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Hit that TILDA key again, and it goes back to regular size. It\u2019s a wonderfully fast shortcut for quick access to all the many more clips in a bin or to get a closer view of your entire timeline. If you didn\u2019t know about that shortcut, then that\u2019s a bonus tip!\n\nBut did you also know there\u2019s a shortcut to toggle full-screen playback? Hit Ctrl + ~ (Control + Tilde), and you jump into a full-screen monitor playback. That\u2019s especially useful if you don\u2019t have a client monitor or a second screen attached and you want to sit back and view your program at full-screen size.\n\nBut there\u2019s one more unmapped shortcut you might not know about that\u2019s also useful: the Toggle Maximize Monitor shortcut.\n\nWhen you map this Toggle Maximize Monitor shortcut, Premiere will toggle the Program monitor to full size no matter where your cursor is located or which panel is selected. This is particularly useful if you want to keep track of where the playhead is, watch the time code, or keep an eye on markers that you may have placed in your timeline. Since you still get to see the interface in the Program panel, you can watch all these things as playback happens.\n\nAnd for one more tip, how about the Maximize or Restore Active Frame shortcut (Shift + Tilde)? Invoking this shortcut will maximize whatever panel is active in the interface (i.e., whichever one has been selected with the blue outline). It disregards where your cursor is and maximizes that \u201cactive\u201d panel.\n\nThis is where I have mapped my Toggle Maximize Monitor:\n\nWhere are you going to map yours?\n\nThis series is courtesy of Adobe.",

            "content": "Adobe Inc. , American developer of printing , publishing , and graphics software. Adobe was instrumental in the creation of the desktop publishing industry through the introduction of its PostScript printer language. Its headquarters are located in San Jose , California .\n\nThe company was founded in 1982 by John Warnock and Charles Geschke . While employed at Xerox Corporation\u2019s Palo Alto (California) Research Center ( PARC ), the two computer scientists had developed a programming language specially designed to describe the precise position, shape, and size of objects on a computer-generated page. This page description language, later known as PostScript, described such objects as letters and graphics in mathematical terms, without reference to any specific computer or printer; any device capable of interpreting the language would be able to generate a representation of the page at any resolution the device supported. When Xerox declined to bring the technology to market, Warnock and Geschke formed their own company to do so, naming it after a creek near their homes.\n\nDesktop publishing revolution\n\nIn 1983 Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), acquired 15 percent of Adobe and became the first licensee of PostScript. In 1985 Apple introduced the first Macintosh-compatible PostScript printer, the LaserWriter, based on a laser-print engine developed by Canon Inc. The LaserWriter included PostScript renditions of several classic typefaces and a PostScript interpreter\u2014in effect, a built-in computer dedicated to the task of translating PostScript commands into marks on each page.\n\nCompared with the printing options previously available for personal computers, the combination of PostScript and laser printing represented a dramatic advance in typographical quality and design flexibility. Together with PageMaker, a page-layout application developed by Aldus Corporation, these technologies enabled any computer user to produce professional-looking reports, flyers, and newsletters without specialized lithography equipment and training\u2014a phenomenon that became known as desktop publishing.\n\nMany commercial printers and publishers were initially scornful because laser printer output fell short of professional standards. But manufacturers of the higher-resolution output devices called imagesetters, led by Linotype-Hell Company, followed Apple\u2019s example in licensing PostScript, and within a few years it became common throughout the publishing industry.\n\nFont wars\n\nAdobe made its initial public stock offering in 1986. Although revenues grew to $168.7 million by 1990, Adobe\u2019s relations with Apple deteriorated in the late 1980s over PostScript licensing fees, and in 1989 Apple announced plans to sell its Adobe stock, collaborate with Microsoft Corporation on development of an enhanced PostScript clone, and introduce a new font-rendering technology of its own, called TrueType. For more than a year the dispute, known as the font wars, roiled the computer and publishing worlds before Apple and Adobe reached a compromise. In the wake of the agreement, Microsoft abandoned its PostScript clone and adopted TrueType for its Windows operating systems.\n\nApplication software\n\nDuring the 1990s Adobe\u2019s revenues from PostScript licensing continued to increase, as did its sales of PostScript fonts; by the end of 1998 the Adobe Type Library encompassed more than 2,500 typefaces. An ever-larger share of the company\u2019s revenues, however, came from sales of application software, initially for the Macintosh platform but later also for the UNIX and Windows operating systems. The first such application, introduced in 1987, was Adobe Illustrator, a PostScript-based drawing package for artists, designers, and technical illustrators. Adobe Photoshop, an application for retouching digitized photographic images, followed three years later and quickly became Adobe\u2019s most successful program. It was one of the first commercial applications with an interface enabling outside developers to make new features available through plug-ins within the main program; scores of developers took advantage of this \u201copen architecture,\u201d helping to cement Photoshop\u2019s dominance within its category.\n\nIn subsequent years Adobe added many other applications, primarily through a series of acquisitions. In 1991 it brought out Adobe Premiere, a program for editing video and multimedia productions. In 1994 the company acquired Aldus and its PageMaker software. The following year Adobe bought Frame Technology Corporation, developer of FrameMaker, a program designed for the production of technical manuals and book-length documents. It also purchased Ceneca Communications, Inc., creator of PageMill, a program for creating World Wide Web pages, and SiteMill, a Web site-management utility. In 1996 Adobe released its first title aimed at consumers, a simplified photo-editing program called PhotoDeluxe.\n\nAnother major company initiative in the 1990s\u2014the Adobe Acrobat product family\u2014was designed to provide a standard format for electronic document distribution. Once a document had been converted to Acrobat\u2019s portable document format (PDF), regardless of its origins, users of any major computer operating system could read and print it, with formatting, typography, and graphics nearly intact, via the Acrobat Reader, an application the company offered for free. However, with the advent of the Internet and its need for compact file transfers, a competing format, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), eroded its market. In 1998 PDF became the new image format for the Macintosh operating system.\n\nBy 1997 almost 80 percent of Adobe\u2019s total revenues came from application sales, and that year marked the first time that Windows-product revenues exceeded Macintosh-product revenues. In 2005 Adobe acquired Macromedia, Inc. In addition to Macromedia FreeHand (a major competitor of Illustrator), Dreamweaver (Web-authoring software), and Director (software for producing CD-ROMs), Adobe gained two innovative programs, Shockwave and Flash, for producing and distributing animations and interactive media over the Internet for viewing in Web browsers. In 2008 Adobe Media Player was introduced as a competitor to Apple\u2019s iTunes, Windows Media Player, and RealPlayer from RealNetworks, Inc. In addition to playing audio and video files in a variety of formats on personal computers, Adobe Media Player was adopted by several television networks for deploying television shows over the Internet in the highly compact Flash format.",

The integration offers brands enhanced, privacy-oriented audience recognition and segmentation solutions.\n\nThe integration was validated through a data-only campaign conducted with Iq Digital and GroupM for an automotive client that resulted in enhanced deterministic reach and improved frequency control and re-identification rates.\n\nThe partnership is another proof-of-concept for Adobe\u2019s CDP, which has attracted brands such as Coca-Cola, agencies such as GroupM\u2019s Wavemaker and publishers such as NBCUniversal, as the industry explores cookie-less options for data usage that prioritize privacy.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThough Google abandoned plans to deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome in 2024, the industry has not backed off from finding privacy-focused alternatives for first-party data collection. Launched last year, Adobe\u2019s Real-Time CDP provides a clean room environment that allows brands to identify and activate publisher audiences across channels without moving or exposing customer data. It also allows brands to measure ad effectiveness directly with publishers and make adjustments to boost engagement.\n\nFor Iq and GroupM\u2019s test of the Utiq integration, the agencies ran a campaign for an automotive brand that marked the first utilization of Utiq\u2019s user-consented signals and Authentic Audiences segments within the CDP for more precise cross-publisher and cross-browser targeting. The campaign was particularly effective in non-Chrome environments where cookie-based methods tend to be less effective.\n\nOver 90% of the campaign\u2019s impressions in non-Chrome browsers were delivered using Utiq\u2019s ID, resulting in a 290% uplift and an increase in net reach, per release details. Additionally, Utiq users in non-Chrome browsers had better frequency control with an average of 3.29 ad touchpoints. They also had 61% better re-identification rates compared to cookie-based targeting methods.\n\nBeyond brand and publisher collaborations, Adobe\u2019s Real-Time CDP can draw from data partners including Snowflake and Amazon Web Services and identity partners like LiveRamp and TransUnion. In a beta with launch partner NBCU, advertisers saw two-times more efficient ad conversion and ten-times better match rates, in addition to a 90% lift compared to standard audience onboarding.",

They all list on Nasdaq, which mandated the reporting until a court threw out rules requiring it in December.\n\nFar fewer large companies are making thorough disclosures about their boards\u2019 makeup so far this year. Among those that did: Apple, Qualcomm, and Starbucks are among more than 20 other big firms included charts with detailed data about their directors\u2019 demographics in their 2025 proxy statements, which shareholders receive before companies\u2019 annual meetings.\n\nSuch board disclosures are on track to continue dwindling as companies move away from diversity reporting more broadly, said Andrew Jones, principal environmental, social, and governance researcher at the Conference Board, a business think tank. Diversity, equity, and inclusion reporting poses a risk for companies, as the Trump administration looks to root out any wrongdoing tied to DEI, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy attract attention? Why attract potential scrutiny?\u201d Jones said. \u201cNo company wants to be one of those companies that finds itself in the political and legal crosshairs.\u201d\n\nDisappearing Disclosures\n\nBloomberg Law\u2019s disclosure analysis is based on proxy statements of companies in the Nasdaq-100 and Nasdaq Financial-100 indexes, representing the largest financial and non-financial firms.\n\nMore than 60 of the companies have submitted proxy statements so far this year. All of them had included board diversity data in those filings in 2024, the last year Nasdaq Inc. required it.\n\nAdobe Inc. , Marriott International Inc. , Charter Communications Inc. , and Fifth Third Bancorp in 2024 each had a proxy statement with a table that showed the gender and demographic breakdown of their directors, modeling suggested reporting templates from Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq since 2022 had required thousands of companies listed on its stock exchanges to report annually on how many board members fit various racial and ethnic categories, and to identify LGBTQ+ or women directors. Companies generally were required to disclose the data in either their proxy statements or on their websites.\n\nThe now-overturned rules also directed firms to have diverse boards or explain why they didn\u2019t. Under President Joe Biden, Nasdaq in 2021secured the consent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to implement the regulations. But the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said in its December decision tossing the rules that the SEC didn\u2019t have the power to approve them.\n\nAdobe and Marriott issued proxy statements less than four months later without a board diversity matrix, a staple of the filings since 2022.\n\nMarriott now only says in its proxy statement that \u201csix of our 13 director nominees are female and seven are male, and four of our director nominees are people of color.\u201d Adobe says in its proxy filing it has seven director nominees with a \u201cdemographic background,\u201d representing \u201ccharacteristics such as race/ethnicity (4 directors) and/or gender (4 directors).\u201d\n\nFifth Third and Charter say even less in their 2025 proxy statements. The bank and the cable television and internet provider both abandoned board diversity charts that first appeared in their 2022 filings and didn\u2019t include any data about their directors\u2019 demographics.\n\nCompanies are increasingly showing that race and gender shouldn\u2019t factor into whether someone has the strength and ability to sit on a board, said Edward Blum, the legal strategist who helped challenge Nasdaq\u2019s rules in court. He also helped bring the case that led to the 2023 Supreme Court decision limiting the use of race in college admissions.\n\n\u201cCompanies that continue to identify and discuss the racial and ethnic backgrounds of their board members are being shortsighted,\u201d Blum said in an interview. \u201cThey are promoting the idea that someone\u2019s race or ethnicity tells us something very, very important about that person. And that I believe is very misguided.\u201d\n\nCharter and Fifth Third representatives declined to comment. Adobe and Marriott representatives didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nReporting Pressure\n\nThe SEC blessed Nasdaq\u2019s rules in 2021 amid a push by BlackRock Inc. , State Street Corp. , and other money managers for more diverse boards. Nasdaq said at the time board diversity improves corporate governance and company performance.\n\nFour years later, in January 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to investigate companies for \u201cillegal DEI.\u201d By then, BlackRock already was abandoning a push for boards to have at least 30% of their directors identify as diverse, according to its 2025 guidelines for shareholder voting released in December. State Street has ended a similar board diversity campaign, according to its 2025 shareholder voting policies.\n\nBut the pullback came after investors had learned through Apple Inc. \u2019s 2025 proxy statement, for example, that it had three board nominees who were women identifying as African American, Asian, and Latino. Qualcomm Inc. shareholders found out in the company\u2019s proxy paperwork this year that it had a woman who identified as Hispanic or Latinx. Starbucks Corp . let its investors know in its latest proxy statement it had women nominated to its board who identified as LGBTQ+ and Asian.\n\nRepresentatives of the companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, though Apple CEO Tim Cook and Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol have defended their corporate diversity efforts this year.\n\nMarian Macindoe, managing director of sustainable investment strategy at Parnassus Investments LLC, said she doesn\u2019t blame companies for scaling back board diversity disclosures as anti-DEI pressure increases. But companies should continue to pursue diverse boards for the good of their businesses, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any uniform board is going to be making high-quality decisions no matter what the composition is, if it\u2019s uniform,\u201d Macindoe said.",

            "content": "He further observed unique market patterns after the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate reduction in September. Gundlach believes bond prices ascended after rate reductions but this situation features two-year Treasury yields increasing by 60 basis points together with ten-year Treasury yields growing by 85 basis points. The bond market displays unexpected behavior after Federal Reserve policy changes because investors observe both this market pattern and falling long bond ETF values. According to Gundlach, the ongoing Federal Reserve pause signifies market stability because they need more evidence before making decisions.\n\nJeffrey Gundlach shared his thoughts on market reactions to the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent meeting through his CNBC interview on January 30. Gundlach explained that the Fed declared no rush in interest rate suppression but investors interpreted it as moderate hawkishness. He stated the federal funds rate aligns perfectly with the two-year Treasury yield showing that the Fed maintains its current financial policy in response to economic conditions. Gundlach expressed skepticism about data-driven Federal Reserve policy because it potentially creates short-term monetary choices.\n\nInvestors who buy debt-free stocks receive the advantage of potentially better dividend payments at times when interest rates are elevated. Companies with robust cash reserves together with no debt hold better chances of allocating dividends to investors. The market value of debt-free stocks tends to be higher when interest rates are elevated.\n\nLow-debt stocks experience lower price volatility in challenging economic circumstances. Economic slowdowns, together with inflationary pressures, bring about elevated interest rates that result in market instability and increased investor concern. Companies without debt stand as more secure financial investments since they encounter a reduced probability of financial problems or bankruptcy. A turbulent market can find potential protection from negative effects through investing in shares with minimal debt which provides stability to uneasy investors.\n\nThe current economic conditions with elevated interest rates have made debt-free stocks increasingly valuable to investors. Companies without debt responsibilities avoid spending their funds on interest costs from loans or different types of borrowing. Due to their enhanced financial flexibility, corporate funds can be directed toward research and development, strategic growth projects, and business expansion initiatives that boost long-term business worth. Debt-free flexibility stands as an essential factor because high interest rates create better business models and financial results that matter during recessions.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Debt Free Halal Stocks to Invest in Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other debt free halal stocks to invest in right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition, Gundlach noted that the stock market faces difficulties due to the broader index\u2019s CAPE ratio of around 35. His comparison between the present CAPE ratio and the ratio that stood at 10 during Ronald Reagan\u2019s time shows that future value expansion is quite limited. Profitability stands as the chief determinant to boost stock market performance rather than multiple business expansions.\n\nWith interest rates unlikely to decline soon, debt-free stocks remain attractive for their stability, resilience, and strong financial positioning.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we chose the top 10 stocks from the S&P Shariah ETF, which includes all Shariah-compliant constituents of the broader index. After this, we compared their market caps with their enterprise value to gauge which ones are debt-free. The companies listed below may not be entirely debt-free, but they maintain a solid financial standing with low net debt and substantial cash reserves, ensuring they can comfortably meet their debt obligations. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Adobe Inc. (ADBE) the Debt Free Halal Stock to Invest in Right Now?\n\nA team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 117\n\nMarket Cap as of March 27: $164.39 billion\n\nEnterprise Value as of March 27: $163.52 billion\n\nThe ninth stock on our list of the best halal stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). It is a global leader in creative and digital marketing software. Its main products\u2014Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat, for example\u2014have established themselves as industry standards for document management and content production, catering to a wide spectrum of clients from small businesses to individual producers. Digital experience creation, collaboration, and enhancement are made possible via the company\u2019s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud platforms.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently released Q2 guidance that matched market forecasts and posted better-than-expected Q1 2025 earnings. Analysts were concerned, meanwhile, about modifications to its disclosure of subscription revenue. The new reporting strategy makes it more difficult to monitor Creative Cloud\u2019s core business performance, according to a Citi analyst who has a neutral rating on the company.\n\nMatthew Swanson, an analyst at RBC Capital, on the other hand, had a positive assessment of the impressive Q1 performance. He emphasized Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s initiatives to implement fresh indicators that provide investors with a better understanding of the company. Swanson also said that focus is turning to the next Adobe Summit, where the business is anticipated to reveal more information regarding how it plans to make money off of its AI technologies. The analyst took a cautious stance, lowering his price objective for the stock from $550 to $530, even though he still maintained an Outperform rating.\n\nOverall, ADBE ranks 9th on our list of debt free halal stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Adobe Stock\n\nThe Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 had three big changes to 401(k) plans that go into effect this year, 2025. These changes are:\n\nAutomatic enrollments for new employees\n\nInclusion of Long-Term Part-Time Employees (LTPT)\n\nIncrease in the \"catch-up\" contributions\n\nExpand Gary Logan Wes Shannon\n\nThese changes are very important to know for small employers with existing 401(k) plans and those considering starting a 401(k) plan. Also, if you are a part-time employee or an employee over the age of 50, these changes will affect you.\n\n401(k) retirement plans are employer sponsored, qualified retirement plans that are available to employees. The employee can elect to have an amount or percentage of their pay deducted either before or after taxes \u2014 Roth 401(k) \u2014 and invested in a retirement account with the plan. In addition to the employees\u2019 contributions the employer may offer a contribution as a match to what the employee puts in. A standard match is usually a dollar for dollar on contributions of 3% or less of pay plus fifty cents on the dollar for the percentage of pay above 3% up to 5% of pay. Any contribution above 5% of pay would not be matched by the employer in this example.\n\nTraditionally, the employee had to elect to participate and the opportunity to do so was offered usually sometime within or upon the completion of one year since the hiring date. The new rules require company plans to automatically enroll all employees if they do not elect to enroll or elect to opt out of the plan. The law requires the automatic enrollment to be between 3% and 10% of the employee\u2019s pay. If the automatic enrollment is less than 10% it is required to automatically increase 1% per year until the contributions are 10% of pay.\n\nIf a business already has a 401(k) plan and has more than 10 employees, they must amend their current plan to start automatic enrollments of all employees. The employees may still request to opt out, but they must initiate that process. Employers starting a new 401(k) will have automatic enrollment as a part of the plan.\n\nCongress passed this law in order to to drive more people into 401(k) plans and encourage greater retirement savings.\n\nThe second new rule is to include any employees who have worked at least 500 hours per year for at least three years. These employees are now labeled \u201cLong-term Part-time (LTPT) employees. Previously, people who only worked 500 hours in a year were not eligible to join the plan. This, again, is an effort to get more people access to plans for retirement savings. Old plans will have to be amended, and new plans will have this as a rule to the plan.\n\nThe last big change is in the \u201ccatch-up\u201d provisions for older employees. For the year 2025 employees may contribute up to $23,500 per year to their 401(k) plans. For employees who are over 50 and under 60 years of age they get to increase their contribution maximum by $7,500 to a total of $31,000. Employees aged 60, 61,62, and 63 can increase their maximum $11,250 to a total of $34,750. Employees aged 64 or more go back to a maximum contribution of $31,000.\n\nAgain, Congress is trying to get people to accumulate more retirement benefits. Usually by age 50, most workers have the kids out of the house and are experiencing more available discretionary cash and can use that extra money to \u201ccatch-up\u201d on their retirement. Also, most workers are making the most money and are their most productive age between 50 and retirement. This increase in contribution limits is a very good thing.\n\nWhether you are a business owner or an employee, these new rules for 2025 will affect you and, for the most part, are for the better of society.\n\nIf you run a business, having the services of a Certified Financial Planner\u2122 to advise you on these changes and how to amend your plan can be very beneficial. Remember, CFP\u00aes know their business as well as you do yours. As an employee working with a CFP\u00ae on a comprehensive financial plan will help you navigate and use these changes for your best advantage.\n\nWes Shannon CFP\u00ae is a Certified Financial Planning Professional for Brazos Wealth Advisors in Fort Worth.",

The estimated 36-month OS rate in the osimertinib arm was 82% vs 73% in the placebo arm; the 48-month OS rates were 70% and 52%, respectively. Notably, 80% of patients who discontinued study treatment in the placebo arm subsequently received a third-generation EGFR TKI.\n\n\u201cOsimertinib after definitive chemoradiotherapy is the new standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC,\u201d Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD, FACP, FASCO, of Emory University School of Medicine, Winship Cancer Institute, in Atlanta, GA, said in a late-breaking presentation of the data.\n\nTaking a Closer Look at LAURA\n\nThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase 3 study enrolled 216 adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III, NSCLC who had not experienced disease progression during or following chemoradiation and who had EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon L858R mutations, a World Health Organization performance status score of 0 or 1, and a maximum interval of 6 weeks between last dose of chemoradiation and randomization. Patients were at least 18 years of age or at least 20 years of age if enrolled in Japan.\n\nStudy participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral osimertinib at 80 mg or placebo once daily until disease progression by blinded independent central review (BICR) or RECIST 1.1, intolerable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria were met. Notably, open-label osimertinib was offered to both arms following disease progression.\n\nThe primary end point of the trial was BICR-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1, and secondary end points comprised OS and central nervous system PFS. Secondary post-progression end points included time to first subsequent treatment (TFST), second PFS (PFS2), and time to second subsequent treatment (TSST).\n\nPrevious data from the study showed that osimertinib significantly improved PFS vs placebo in this population.2 The median PFS with osimertinib was 39.1 months (95% CI, 31.5-not estimable) vs 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.4) with placebo, translating to an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10-0.24; P < .001). The data supported the FDA\u2019s decision to approve osimertinib in September 2024 for use in adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed during or after concurrent or sequential platinum-based chemoradiation and whose tumors harbored EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations.3 PFS by investigator assessment also proved consistent with the primary end point, with a hazard ratio of 0.19 (95% CI, 0.12-0.29; nominal P < .001) in favor of osimertinib over placebo.1\n\nBaseline characteristics were noted to be well balanced between the treatment arms. Most patients in the osimertinib and placebo arms were female (63%; 58%), never smokers (71%; 67%), Asian (81%; 85%), had stage IIIB disease per American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition staging criteria (47%; 52%), had adenocarcinoma histology (97%; 95%), and had received concurrent chemoradiation (92%; 85%).\n\nIn the osimertinib arm, the WHO performance score was 0 for 56% and 1 for 44% of patients; in the placebo arm, these respective percentages were 42% and 58%. In the osimertinib arm, 52% of patients had EGFR exon 19 deletion at the time of screening and 48% had L858R mutations; in the placebo arm, these respective percentages were 59% and 41%. The median target lesion size by BICR in the osimertinib arm was 33 mm and was 36 mm in the placebo arm.\n\nDelving Deeper into the Updated Analysis: Subsequent Treatment and Additional Efficacy Data\n\nOf the 143 patients randomized to the osimertinib arm, 48% of patients were still receiving treatment and 52% had discontinued. Thirty percent of patients received subsequent osimertinib after discontinuation of study treatment. Of the 73 patients randomized to the placebo arm, 5% were still receiving placebo and 95% had discontinued. Notably, 78% of these patients received subsequent osimertinib after study treatment discontinuation.\n\nEGFR TKIs were the most common first subsequent treatment, according to Ramalingam. Seventy-three percent of patients on the osimertinib arm who discontinued randomized treatment (n = 74) began a first subsequent treatment (FST). FSTs included radiotherapy (31%), osimertinib (28%), cytotoxic chemotherapy (27%), another EGFR TKI (14%), a VEGF inhibitor (7%), immunotherapy (5%), or other (4%).\n\nOf the patients who discontinued randomized treatment on the placebo arm (n = 69), 87% of patients began a FST. FSTs included osimertinib (77%), radiotherapy (10%), another EGFR TKI (9%), cytotoxic chemotherapy (4%), and a VEGF inhibitor (3%).\n\nCytotoxic chemotherapy was the most common second subsequent treatment, Ramalingam added.\n\nOsimertinib was also found to lead to clinically meaningful improvements in TFST, PFS2, and TSST vs placebo. The median TFST was 43.8 months (95% CI, 39.9-NC) with osimertinib vs 9.5 months (95% CI, 6.6-11.5) with placebo (HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.21; P < .001). The median PFS2 with osimertinib was 48.2 months (95% CI, 44.4-NC) vs 47.4 months (95% CI, 28.2-NC) with placebo (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.08; P = .088). The median TSST was not reached vs 47.4 months in the osimertinib and placebo arms, respectively HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; P = .022).\n\n\u201cLonger-term outcomes from LAURA further support the benefit of osimertinib over placebo for patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC without progression during or following chemoradiotherapy,\u201d Ramalingam concluded.\n\nDisclosures: Dr Ramalingam disclosed institutional research funding from Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer, and travel/accomodations/expenses from AbbVie.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Workers across the supply chain are experiencing a range of intensified life safety threats, including external and internal factors. But there is an evolving line of defense that can greatly strengthen safety initiatives, and that\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBad actors and criminals are employing new tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain, from warehouses to every stop in the journey. Data from CargoNet confirmed a 14% increase in cargo theft across the United States and Canada in Q3 2024 compared to 2023, with more than $39 million worth of goods stolen.\n\nAdding to the impact of these material losses, supply chain personnel are caught in the crosshairs of criminal activity and may decide the risks are no longer worth the employment. There are also innate risks of loading and transporting goods across long distances and the daily hazards they must overcome, especially as they manage greater volumes of goods and peak ordering seasons.\n\nAI is helping to mitigate these risks, with organizations increasingly applying AI to better detect threats and employ proactive deterrence that could prevent interruptions. Let\u2019s examine how AI can help build a more resilient supply chain.\n\nAI in the supply chain\n\nAs showcased in the Top Software and Tech Awards 2024, the supply chain is ripe with innovation spanning everything from supply chain visibility and warehouse automation to robotics and procurement or ERP solutions.\n\nSolutions across these categories are being supercharged by AI that is rapidly advancing in its ability to interact in real world scenarios with constantly changing conditions, augment human capabilities to keep us safer, and continually learn from its data to deliver more value than we ever thought possible.\n\nIn addition to completing necessary paperwork with great accuracy and sourcing suppliers for procurement teams, here are 5 ways to use AI to bolster safety strategies along the supply chain.\n\nDriver protection\n\nTrucks can be augmented with interior cameras and sensors to monitor a driver\u2019s face and detect if they are distracted, drowsy, or otherwise impaired, giving vocal cues to help prevent accidents from occurring. AI-powered cameras and sensors on the exterior can even monitor road conditions to enable autonomous driving. This mix of driverless technology and driver optimization is making it significantly safer for everyone on the road and reducing the mental strain on drivers.\n\nIncident analysis\n\nIf an incident does occur at a warehouse, on the road, or while the vehicle is at a rest stop, video intelligence systems make it easy to gather evidence across a large swatch of recording devices in facilities and on trucks to quickly aggregate footage, learn trends, and build a case if prosecution is the appropriate next step. Some rest stops and warehouses even enable local law enforcement to directly access their video feeds if criminal activity is occurring so law enforcement professionals can act fast with the most information possible to optimize their response.\n\nInventory moving\n\nRobotics capabilities have greatly streamlined how humans operate potentially dangerous machinery\u2014or have removed humans from harm\u2019s way completely. Intelligent forklifts and similar equipment continually scan the environment to safely move goods across the warehouse. Some solutions are fully automated, like robots that navigate the warehouse entirely on their own with a human stationed safely at a nearby computer to monitor the system and intervene if anything goes wrong.\n\nInventory tracking\n\nIt is common to have overflow lots for warehouses where drivers can take their loads. Truck identification labels can be read by AI-powered cameras to make it easier to track inventory as it flows through the supply chain and quickly identify where shipments are located. Some warehouses even use drones that can navigate the space and scan labels for inventory tracking.\n\nThese capabilities extend to tracking cargo ship loads by reading container numbers to provide real-time inventory tracking and staging. If shipments are delayed for any reason, the systems can automatically adjust timelines and provide the necessary information to everyone involved in the next step of the shipment\u2019s journey\u2014without requiring manual human processes.\n\nVideo surveillance\n\nMany security cameras offer advanced object recognition and pattern detection that can proactively flag suspicious activity with minimal false alarms. This spans both threat detection and safety adherence, like monitoring if employees are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment and following safety protocols.\n\nThese intelligent cameras make it more scalable and economical for leaders to monitor multiple locations simultaneously at any time, and empower on-the-ground staff to focus their attention to situations as they develop.\n\nCreating safer supply chains\n\nSecurity is a constantly changing problem, which makes it hard to commit to permanent solutions or rely entirely on human capabilities for 24/7 coverage.\n\nAI technologies, including the infrastructure needed to deploy them, need to be agile and nimble. They need to be turnkey and low maintenance. And they need to be future proof and easy to reconfigure to deliver sustained value.\n\nSupply chain leaders have an opportunity to begin introducing AI and testing its capabilities to unlock tangible benefits and scale their use. Think in incremental steps: Start with the most difficult locations/situations first, and use that experience to build out an effective program.\n\nThe safety risks for workers are ever-present. By using AI to augment human coverage and boost efficiency, we can achieve safer supply chains where no individuals are harmed, and no product is stolen.",

Patients experienced outpatient or inpatient management at rates of 26.9% and 1.9%, respectively. The median time to the first dose of pembrolizumab was 23 days and most patients were able to initiate adjuvant therapy (98%).\n\nPatients experienced a major pathologic response (MPR) at a cutoff of less than 10% of viable tumor cells at a rate of 21.1%. At a median follow-up of 67 months, the 60-month recurrence free survival (RFS) rate was 50.5%. Patients who experienced a MPR (n = 11) achieved a 60-month RFS rate of 77.8%; those without a MPR (>10% viable tumor cells; n = 41; 78.9%) experienced a 60-month RFS rate of 43.4%. These data corresponded to a 34.4% improvement in the 60-month RFS rate in favor of patients with a MPR. The 60-month overall survival (OS) rates were 100% in the MPR group vs 72.6% in the non-MPR group.\n\n\u201cA single dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab is a safe and feasible approach with no delays in surgery and appreciable rates of MPR,\u201d the study authors stated in the press briefing.\n\nThe study included patients with resectable stage III or IV melanoma. Eligible patients did not receive prior PD-1 therapy and were treated with 1 dose of pembrolizumab before resection and planned to receive 1 year of adjuvant treatment with the agent.\n\nThe perioperative outcomes consisted of time to surgery, time to adjuvant therapy, and 30-day complications. Oncologic outcomes included pathologic response, patterns and treatment of recurrence, RFS, and OS.\n\nAt baseline, the median age in the overall study cohort was 65 years (IQR, 56-71). All patients were White and non-Hispanic. Most patients had stage III disease (98.1%) and were male (67.3%). BRAF mutational status was comprised of patients with mutated (40.4%), wild-type (32.7%), or unknown (26.9%) disease. Surgery types consisted of cervical (15.4%), axillary (38.5%), or groin (26.9%) lymph node dissection, as well as parotidectomy (1.9%) and wide local excision of in-transit, satellite, or subcutaneous metastases (17.3%).\n\nAdditional data from the study showed that 44.2% of patients experienced disease recurrence. Disease recurrence subtypes consisted of locoregional (47.8%), synchronous (13%), and distant (39.1%). Recurrence was addressed with surgery (39.1%), a change in agent (43.5%), or both (17.4%).\n\nPatients who did not experience a MPR were a median age of 65 years (IQR, 56-71). Most of these patients were male (65.9%) and underwent lymph node dissection (80.5%) for their surgery. BRAF status was wild-type (43.9%), mutant (36.6%), or unknown (19.5%).\n\nSimilarly, patients who did achieve a MPR were a median age of 63 years (IQR, 50-67). Most patients were male (72.7%) and received lymph node dissection (90.9%). Patients had BRAF unknown (54.5%), wild-type (27.3%), or mutant (18.2%) disease.\n\nAll patients were able to undergo surgery and the median time to surgery was 21 days. Most patients experienced no immune-related adverse effects (irAEs; 96.1%). One patient experienced grade 1 rash and another experienced grade 2 fatigue and transaminitis. There were no grade 3 or 4 irAEs reported.\n\n\u201cLate recurrences [were] observed uncommonly in the MPR group, suggesting the need for long-term follow-up,\u201d the study authors stated in conclusion. \u201cFurther work [is] needed to delineate [which patients] benefit from anti\u2013PD-1 monotherapy compared [with] combination approaches.\u201d\n\nReference\n\nShafique N, Farooq MS, Mattfield V, et al.

            "content": "DIGITAL transformation is a critical driver of business growth, but navigating it isn't always easy. At the Adobe Summit, I spoke with Jeremy Willmott, senior director of Adobe's Digital Strategy Group in the APAC region, to explore how Adobe is helping businesses embrace this shift. Central to this effort is Adobe's new Agentic AI \u2014 AI-powered tools designed to act as collaborative teammates, automating high-value marketing tasks so teams can focus on strategy and creativity.\n\n\"I've built a team of people who have held customer-side CFO, CIO, and CMO roles and led major transformations,\" Willmott explained. Leveraging Adobe's real-time data \u2014 tracking customer interactions across the region's best-known brands \u2014 his team identifies high-impact opportunities for growth and advises companies on building effective people, processes, platforms, and measurement strategies to ensure long-term success.\n\nAdobe's Agentic AI, GenStudio\n\nTo turn insights into action, Adobe developed Agentic AI \u2014 a suite of intelligent tools designed to help marketers overcome key challenges. At the Adobe Summit, the company unveiled ten purpose-built AI agents on the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) to bring this vision to life. These agents proactively manage tasks such as content creation, audience targeting, and website optimization, significantly reducing manual effort.\n\n\"What Adobe does really well is build agents around key marketer problems. Even the names say it all \u2014 the Content Production Agent, the Site Optimization Agent, the Experimentation Agent,\" Willmott noted.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAdobe's GenStudio integrates Firefly and Workfront capabilities into a single intuitive interface, enabling teams to rapidly create, deploy, and measure campaigns with real-time optimization. By streamlining workflows, Adobe is accelerating traditional marketing processes and unlocking new levels of efficiency and scalability.\n\nChallenges in AI adoption\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile these tools offer robust solutions, many businesses still face practical hurdles in adopting AI. Willmott noted that around one-third of APAC companies are experimenting with AI, but many struggle to determine where to begin.\n\n\"The biggest challenge we see is: Where do we start? Which part of the experience should we focus on? Is it content creation? Audience building? Scaling content? Measurement?\" Willmott pointed out.\n\nAnother major challenge is using AI responsibly. With evolving regulations and growing privacy concerns, businesses must consider not just what AI can do \u2014 but how it's done.\n\n\"At Adobe, we focus on accountability, responsibility, and transparency. All of our AI goes through rigorous ethics protocols and is built for specific marketing use cases,\" Willmott explained. Adobe's Content Authenticity Initiative ensures transparency in digital content, showing its origins and how it was created \u2014 helping combat misinformation and deepfakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssential skills in AI-driven era\n\nWillmott also addressed concerns that AI could displace marketing roles. He emphasized that AI is designed to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them. One key skill marketers must develop is prompt engineering \u2014 crafting effective inputs for generative AI to maximize its value and ensure it aligns with strategic goals.\n\n\"The questions we ask these agents will become the next marketing superpower. If I'm a marketer today, that's what I'm focusing on \u2014 and what I'm asking my team to do. Learn to ask the right questions, use the agents effectively, and think critically about how to measure success,\" Willmott advised.\n\nOn AI's role in the workforce, he added, \"AI won't replace your job \u2014 but someone who knows how to use AI better than you might.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture trends, strategic advice\n\n\"I think the brands that adopt AI and integrate it into their processes will be the brands that win,\" Willmott said. While the fundamentals of marketing remain unchanged \u2014 understanding customers, crafting the right message, selecting the right channels, and measuring outcomes \u2014 AI dramatically enhances the speed, accuracy, and scale of execution.\n\nWillmott advises companies to start by identifying their most critical opportunities \u2014 whether acquisition, conversion, retention, or brand building \u2014 and then selecting the AI agents that best support those goals. By aligning AI tools with specific needs and streamlining workflows, Adobe's Agentic AI doesn't just automate processes \u2014 it reshapes how marketing teams work, scale, and compete in a digital-first world.\n\nAs AI becomes more deeply embedded in marketing workflows, the real opportunity lies beyond automation. The future of marketing is the synergy between human creativity and AI-driven precision \u2014 where technology enhances, rather than replaces, the imaginative work that drives meaningful customer experiences.",

It is also an easy way to ruin your photos during the editing process if you don\u2019t understand the sliders. This video talks through five sliders in Adobe Lightroom that will destroy your images.\n\nAdobe Lightroom can be an excellent photo editing tool, and it gets more powerful with every release. With that capability to make your photos better through editing, it also comes with the potential to ruin your images. In this video, Mark Denney walks through five sets of sliders that, if used without restraint, do more harm than good to your images.\n\nDenney looks at commonly used sliders in Adobe Lightroom and walks through what the image looks like when the sliders are moved too much, and then what a more subtle edit looks like. Denney looks at several groupings of sliders, including the Texture, Clarity, and Dehaze sliders; the Whites slider versus Exposure; and the nuances of Vibrance and Saturation. Denney also spends time explaining what each slider does and when each should be used.\n\nEven as a heavy user of Adobe Lightroom for my photo editing, I found the information Denney provided helpful. While I know to always be careful with how big of an adjustment I make, many parts of the video reinforced my knowledge. I also liked how he used the histogram as a way to demonstrate how big of an effect the Texture, Clarity, and Dehaze sliders can have on an image.",

            "content": "Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this software maker have returned -9.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAdobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.42 points to a change of +10.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.99 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.",

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

He now owns 29,876 Adobe shares worth $11.6 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDurn last bought ADBE stock on the open market in September 2022, when the executive paid $936,360 for 3,250 shares at an average price of $288.11 each. His latest purchase of Adobe\u2019s stock comes with the share price down 21% over the last 12 months, including an 11% decline so far this year.\n\nAI Concerns\n\nADBE stock has pulled back over concerns about the impact artificial intelligence will have on the company\u2019s creative software products that include Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. Adobe has responded to the threat by integrating more AI features into its products.\n\nEarlier in March, Adobe reported strong quarterly financial results that beat Wall Street\u2019s targets on the top and bottom lines. The company announced earnings per share (EPS) of $5.08, which was ahead of forecasts that called for $4.97. Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at $5.71 billion, which topped analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of $5.66 billion. Sales were up 10% from a year earlier.\n\nDespite the strong print, ADBE stock has continued to slump.\n\nIs ADBE Stock a Buy?\n\nAdobe has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 29 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 19 Buy and 10 Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average ADBE price target of $528.23 implies 36.14% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on ADBE stock\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

Also at GDC, we gave a sneak peek at powerful new rendering capabilities coming to Substance 3D Designer and introduced a new Signature Collection in Substance 3D Assets.\n\nConnecting with the game development community at GDC is always a highlight for The Adobe Substance 3D team. In this month\u2019s blog, we dig a little deeper into the innovations we shared at the conference.\n\nImproved path and fill capabilities in Substance 3D Painter\n\nThe latest release of Painter enhances your creative potential with improved 3D path and fill capabilities, allowing for more precise detailing and mask creation. Create custom shapes with the new filled paths feature and take advantage of geometry- and angle-snapping for unprecedented accuracy in your texturing work.\n\nYou'll also experience streamlined workflows with the auto-update feature for resources \u2014 creating a live link so any changes in an asset are automatically updated in your Painter project. The new automatic cage option for baking texture maps significantly reduces the time required to achieve precise results. Finally, a new unified export window puts all options at your fingertips, making it faster to export both meshes and textures. Performance improvements round out this release, ensuring a smoother experience when working with complex projects.\n\nLearn more about these features and more in Substance 3D Painter.\n\nPowerful new renderer coming to Substance 3D Designer\n\nGDC attendees got a sneak peek at the next Substance Designer. Designer\u2019s powerful new renderer brings superior quality visualization that matches consistently with other Substance applications. You can load a USD scene and build textures right in the context of that scene, eliminating the constant back-and-forth of traditional workflows.\n\nThe expanded node library and new generators accelerate material creation, while enhanced accessibility through rich tooltips provides more information about tools and capabilities. These intuitive tooltips provide deeper insights into each feature, helping you get the most out of Designer, whether you\u2019re new to the app or an experienced user.\n\nTexturing the past in Substance 3D Assets: A Bulgarian village by Niki Marinov\n\nImage Credit: Niki Marinov.\n\nWith the launch of unmetered Substance 3D Assets, artists have been downloading as many materials as their projects require and the demand for materials and 3D assets continues to grow.\n\nAnd we\u2019re steadily increasing the number of assets available.

Respondents also reported they use the tool for getting present ideas, finding unique products and creating shopping lists.\n\nAlmost 2 in 5 respondents say they\u2019ve used generative AI for online shopping, while just over half say they plan to do so this year, Adobe found\n\n\u201cOnline shoppers are seeing benefits in using an AI-powered chat interface, as it shortens the time it takes for them to receive information that is personalized to their needs,\u201d Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights said in a statement. \u201cThis is reshaping how businesses think about customer engagement, especially with the arrival of AI agents that will be able to handle more complex tasks and make highly tailored recommendations.\u201d\n\nMost respondents, more than 9 in 10, said using AI when shopping enhanced their experience, Pandya noted. Additionally, 87% say they\u2019re more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases.\n\nLast year, Adobe conducted a similar survey and found nearly 3 in 5 respondents reported that generative AI already improved their online shopping experience. Over time, the generative AI customer experience has grown to be more useful and satisfying to customers.\n\nGenerative AI tools are drawing shoppers away from traditional search engines, Capgemini recently found. Shoppers also want the tech to aggregate results from online search engines, social media platforms and retailers\u2019 websites.",

            "content": "The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express happens to be one of the best elite cards that business owners know and love. The Amex Business Platinum card, with its $695 annual fee (rates & fees), has an impressive line-up of benefits and perks that easily justify the hefty annual fee.\n\nOne such benefit is the Adobe credit, which offers up to $150 in statement credits every year on eligible purchases. However, there are a ton of terms and conditions you\u2019ll need to abide by in order for your purchase to qualify for this benefit, as not many Adobe purchases will trigger this statement credit.\n\nSo in this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to use this credit for maximum value. Let\u2019s get right into it!\n\nHow To Enroll and Use the Amex $150 Adobe Credit\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum card\u2018s Adobe credit of $150 per year is valid only for a few purchases and subscriptions. We\u2019ve seen countless stories of people trying to use their Amex Business Platinum card to pay for random Adobe purchases only to find out that they were not reimbursed. You\u2019ll want to read the rest of this article very closely to make sure your purchase qualifies.\n\nTo start off, you will need to enroll in the Business Platinum Adobe Benefit before making any purchases or setting up any subscriptions. To do so, simply log into your Amex online account. Then, click Rewards & Benefits on the top menu, followed by Benefits. After that, hover to the Business Platinum Adobe Benefit box and click Get Started.\n\nYou\u2019ll then see a box that looks like this:\n\nImage Credit: American Express\n\nCheck off the box that says I Understand and agree to the terms and conditions and click Enroll.\n\nOnly certain annual prepaid subscriptions will be eligible for the $150 credit, so keep that in mind, as well. Remember, only subscriptions made directly with Adobe are eligible for the $150 credit.\n\nLastly, annual prepaid subscriptions renew automatically every year until canceled, so keep that in mind.\n\nAfter the Adobe credit is activated, simply use your Amex Business Platinum card to pay for any eligible Adobe subscription via this link, and you\u2019ll see a statement credit of up to $150 per calendar year posted to your account within 2 to 4 weeks after the purchase is made.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the $150 credit, call the number on the back of your card to check on the status of the credit.\n\nTypes of Eligible Subscriptions with Adobe\n\nImage Credit: Emily Bernal via Unsplash\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the types of eligible subscriptions.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud All Apps for Teams\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a suite of software applications that include:\n\nAcrobat Pro\n\nAcrobat Reader\n\nAdobe Express\n\nAero\n\nAfter Effects\n\nAnimate\n\nAudition\n\nBridge\n\nCapture\n\nCharacter Animator\n\nDimension\n\nDreamweaver\n\nFill & Sign\n\nFresco\n\nIllustrator\n\nInCopy\n\nInDesign\n\nLightroom\n\nLightroom Classic\n\nMedia Encoder\n\nPhotoshop\n\nPhotoshop Camera\n\nPhotoshop Express\n\nPremiere Pro\n\nPremiere Rush\n\nScan\n\nXD\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is sold in these plans:\n\nIndividuals\n\nStudents and teachers\n\nTeams\n\nOnly Teams plans are covered under the Amex Business Platinum card\u2019s $150 Adobe credit, and prepaid, annual plans start at $1,019.88 per year per license.\n\nSome features exclusive to Teams subscriptions include:\n\nAdmin Console for managing licenses\n\nAdvanced 24/7 tech support\n\n2 1:1 expert sessions per user per year\n\nUnlimited job posts using Adobe Talent\n\nSlack and Microsoft Teams app integration\n\n1TB of cloud storage, Adobe Portfolio, Adobe Fonts, and access to the latest features and updates as soon as they\u2019re released\n\nSo, using the $150 Adobe credit would save you around 15% off of your total subscription fees. For this reason, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend going out of your way to purchase an Adobe subscription just to use the Adobe credit \u2014 but it would definitely make sense to pay using your Amex Business Platinum card if you actually use Adobe software to help run your business.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud Single Apps (Teams Subscriptions Only)\n\nIf you don\u2019t need the complete suite of products included in Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps, you can set up an annual prepaid subscription for single apps.\n\nHowever, all of these subscriptions must still be for Teams.\n\nIn other words, instead of buying the Creative Cloud package, you can purchase Adobe Creative Cloud applications \u00e0 la carte.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of how much each Creative Cloud for Teams application costs:\n\nAdobe Stock \u2014 $359.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $359.88 per year per license Adobe XD \u2014 $275.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $275.88 per year per license After Effects \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Animate \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Audition \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Dreamweaver \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Illustrator \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license InCopy \u2014 $59.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $59.88 per year per license InDesign \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Lightroom (1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n(1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license Photoshop \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Premiere Pro \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Substance 3D Collection \u2014 $1,199.88 per year per license\n\nAdobe Stock enables you to access millions of high-quality, royalty-free assets for your next creative project.\n\nAdobe XD is a UI/UX software for designing, prototyping, and sharing user experiences.\n\nAfter Effects creates motion graphics and visual effects for film, TV, video, and web.\n\nAnimate designs interactive vector and bitmap animations for games, apps, and the web, as well as publish content to reach viewers on desktop, mobile, and TV.\n\nAudition allows you to create, mix, and design sound effects.\n\nDreamweaver is a tool to easily design, code, and publish websites and web applications that look amazing on any screen.\n\nIllustrator creates precise designs, illustrations, and vector graphics on desktop and iPad.\n\nInCopy helps writers and editor style text, track changes, and make simple layout modifications while designers work on the same document in InDesign, all without disrupting workflows.\n\nInDesign focuses on print and digital media, specifically with designing pages and layouts.\n\nLightroom is used to edit, organize, store, and share photos from anywhere\n\nPhotoshop is designed to help create graphics, photos, and art on desktop and iPad. This subscription comes with Adobe Fresco for drawing and painting.\n\nPremiere Pro allows you to professionally edit videos and film.\n\nSubstance 3D is a collection of 6 applications to create models, design materials, texture assets, and render scenes. These 6 applications consist of Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Adobe Substance 3D Stager, Adobe Substance 3D Designer, Adobe Substance 3D Sampler, Adobe Substance 3D Modeler, and Adobe Substance 3D Assets.\n\nAdobe Acrobat Pro DC With E-Sign (Teams Subscription Only)\n\nThe other way you can use your Adobe credit is to pay for an annual prepaid subscription to Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams.\n\nWe would argue that this is actually the more productive way to use your $150 Adobe credit. That\u2019s because it requires a much smaller annual commitment and offers some useful tools that your business can likely use.\n\nCurrently, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC now includes e-sign capabilities, so the subscription you\u2019ll want to look for is Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams, which starts at $287.88 per year per license for an annual prepaid plan.\n\nFactoring in the $150 Adobe credit means you\u2019re saving more than 50% on your subscription cost.\n\nWhile Acrobat Pro is included in the Creative Cloud subscription above, this particular subscription plan probably makes more sense to you if your business doesn\u2019t necessarily have a need for creative software for video production, photo editing, and more.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a business that regularly creates PDFs and documents that require signatures, you may benefit enormously from Acrobat Pro.\n\nSome of the most popular features of Acrobat Pro include:\n\nSign and collect unlimited signatures\n\nMicrosoft 365 integration\n\nExport, convert, and edit PDFs (directly in the PDF)\n\nCollect e-signatures from websites\n\nAdd custom branding\n\nCreate searchable, editable PDFs\n\nCompare PDFs and permanently redact information\n\n\u2026 and the list goes on!\n\nPlus, your Acrobat Pro subscription comes with desktop, web, and mobile access, as well as 100GB of cloud storage.\n\nSecuring the Amex Business Platinum Card\n\nELEVATED OFFER Terms Apply / Rates & Fees The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express U.P.

By integrating with Utiq, brands gain enhanced audience recognition and segmentation in a privacy-compliant way. This synergy strengthens targeting and relevant messaging, allowing businesses to maximize engagement while maintaining full control over their customer data.\n\nTo evidence this combined capability, iq digital and GroupM ran a campaign that marked the first utilisation of Utiq\u2019s user-consented signals and Authentic Audiences within Adobe\u2019s Real-Time CDP, enabling precise cross-publisher and cross-browser targeting.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other top blue chip AI stocks to buy according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nCliff Asness is one of Wall Street\u2019s most respected hedge fund managers. The founder and managing principal of AQR Capital Management has often relied on various strategies to squeeze value in the equity markets. Right from relying on fundamental analysis, Asness has also etched his name by focusing on value and momentum strategies that have often generated solid returns.\n\nAQR Capital Management has generated positive outcomes over the past three years, having recorded its best year in 2022, when it gained 43.5%. Its 16.8% gain in 2021, 18.4% in 2023 and 15.1% in 2024 affirm its status as the best-performing multi-stage hedge fund.\n\nThe hedge fund is increasingly deploying artificial intelligence to enhance its performance. The technology is used in the core parts of the investing process while helping combine and weigh the various investment factors. AI is also being used to speed up coding and create trading signals from text.\n\nREAD ALSO: Cathie Wood\u2019s Top 12 AI Stock Picks in 2025 and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s coming for me now. It turns out it\u2019s annoyingly better than me. AI, to be honest, pushes us a little on the spectrum away from some of the traditional things we\u2019ve talked about, and that was uncomfortable for me,\u201d said Asness.\n\nEven as Asness continues to integrate artificial intelligence into the overall investment strategy at AQR Capital Management, he remains wary that the markets have become less efficient over the past 35 years.\n\n\u201cOne of my themes is that markets just don\u2019t get efficient on their own. There are our tools, our institutions, our traditions, and ultimately markets are a voting mechanism. So anything we do to make that noisier is going to make markets less efficient,\u201d Asness said.\n\nIn a less efficient market, rational value investors need to weather the ups and downs that come into being. Consequently, the AQR Capital Management chief believes rational investors prepared to stay in the game for the long term stand a better chance of navigating the less inefficient markets.\n\nThe longer an investor\u2019s timeline, the better their capacity to endure the fluctuations of the market and benefit from its reduced efficiency, assuming they can weather elevated risk and potentially prolonged periods of discomfort. Several aspects can assist with this, such as not fixating on every single item in your portfolio, losing sight of the broader picture, and not believing that three to five-year trends are fixed.\n\nAsness also advises investors to be wary of over-investing in private assets in an attempt to stabilize their returns. A consistent critic of private equity, Asness contends that firms which do not accurately assess assets against market value are obscuring the genuine level of risk investors are embracing. He expresses confusion as to why investors appear prepared to pay a premium for what he refers to as \u201cvolatility laundering,\u201d arguing that by doing so, they are settling for diminished returns.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make the list of 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness, we analyzed AQR Capital Management Q4 2024 13F filing. We settled on the top blue chip companies with significant exposure to artificial intelligence. We then analyzed them on why they stand out as Billionaire Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the value of AQR Capital Management equity stakes. Additionally, we have mentioned the broader hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc.

An increased ORR was observed in those who received the agent for up to 4 years vs those who continued treatment for up to 1 year, at 45.7% (complete response [CR], 11.4%; partial response [PR], 34.3%) and 34.3% (CR, 4.3%; PR, 30.0%), respectively. Across years 3 and 4, additional CRs and PRs were reported in 3 patients each.\n\n\u201cThese results show the long-term efficacy and safety of continuous use of nirogacestat with a median exposure of [33.6] months, extended from 20.6 months at the primary analysis,\u201d lead study author Bernd Kasper, MD, PhD, of the Sarcoma Unit at the University of Heidelberg and Mannheim University Medical Center, Mannheim Cancer Center, in Germany, said during a presentation of the data.\n\nDelving Into DeFi: Background and Design\n\nIn November 2023, the FDA approved nirogacestat for the treatment of adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment.2 This regulatory decision was based on previously reported data from DeFi.\n\nThe global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adult patients with desmoid tumors progressing by at least 20% per RECIST 1.1 who were randomly assigned 1:1 between the nirogacestat and placebo arms.2 In double-blind portion of the study, patients received 150 mg of nirogacestat twice per day (n = 70) or placebo. During the open-label extension portion of the study, patients in the experimental arm continued twice-daily dosing with nirogacestat (n = 39), and eligible patients in the placebo arm were allowed to begin receiving nirogacestat at 150 mg twice per day.\n\nThe primary objective of DeFi was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nirogacestat at years 1 to 4. In the landmark ORR analysis, investigators looked at patients randomly assigned to the nirogacestat arm in the double-blind portion of the study prior to the data cutoff date of December 19, 2024.\n\nThe primary end points of the landmark analysis were tumor response and durability per RECIST 1.1; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); and safety.\n\nLooking at Long-Term Efficacy and Safety\n\nAdditional findings demonstrated that among evaluable patients in the nirogacestat arm (n = 66), the median best change in target tumor size was \u201332.3% (range, \u2013100% to 6%) with at least 1 year of treatment (n = 46), \u201342.5% (range, \u2013100% to 2%) with at least 2 years of treatment (n = 40), \u201351.3% (range, \u2013100% to 2%) with at least 3 years (n = 33), and \u201375.8% (range, \u2013100% to 2%) with at least 4 years (n = 15).\n\nNotably, PRO gains were sustained in patients who received nirogacestat. The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline ranged from \u20131.26 to \u20131.86 for BPI-SF average worst pain intensity score; \u20130.84 to \u20131.26 for DTSS total symptom score; and \u20130.41 to \u20130.69 for DTIS physical functioning. LS mean change from baseline ranged from \u20130.60 to 7.96 for EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score; 0.88 to 7.83 for EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning score; and 8.45 to 14.18 for EORTC QLQ-C30 role functioning score.\n\nRegarding safety (n = 69), most treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) were grade 1 or 2, and the incidence and severity of common TEAEs decreased after year 1. The most frequently reported TEAEs consisted of diarrhea, nausea, ovarian toxicity, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, and headache.\n\nData regarding ovarian toxicity were consistent with findings from the study\u2019s primary analysis. Three patients experienced an additional instance of ovarian toxicity following a previously reported TEAE, and 1 patient experienced first-time ovarian toxicity.\n\nBetween years 2 and 3, TEAEs led to dose reductions in 5 patients; no patients required dose reductions after year 3.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Photography editing software can dramatically impact your workflow and final results. Understanding the differences between Adobe's three distinct Lightroom programs helps you choose the right tool for your specific needs, whether you're shooting in a professional studio or editing on the go.\n\nComing to you from Aaron Nace with Phlearn, this informative video breaks down the key differences between Lightroom Classic, Lightroom, and Lightroom Mobile. Nace explains that Lightroom Classic serves as the professional-level program designed specifically for organizing and editing images stored locally on your computer. This version excels at advanced editing capabilities while allowing you to organize photos throughout your file system. One standout feature Nace highlights is tethered shooting, which enables you to connect your camera directly to your computer during studio sessions. Images transfer immediately upon capture, giving you instant feedback on your shots without having to import them manually later. The interface might look familiar to longtime users since this is the original version that established the Lightroom brand.\n\nLightroom (without \"Classic\") represents Adobe's newer cloud-based editing solution. While you can still work with locally stored images, Nace demonstrates how this program was built primarily around cloud integration. The streamlined interface maintains most of the same editing tools as Classic but adds automatic syncing capabilities. When you make adjustments to cloud-stored images, these changes instantly appear across all your devices. Nace shows how this creates a seamless workflow between desktop and mobile editing. The cloud storage also provides a valuable backup function\u2014if your hard drive crashes or your computer is lost, your precious images remain safe in Adobe's cloud, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.\n\nLightroom Mobile completes the ecosystem by bringing professional-level editing to your smartphone or tablet. Nace demonstrates how changes made on mobile devices automatically sync back to the desktop version. In the video, he shows this process in action by starting an edit on the computer, continuing it on his phone by adding a vignette effect, and then seeing those changes instantly appear back on the desktop version. This three-way flexibility allows you to begin your editing process wherever you happen to be and continue it on any device without missing a beat.\n\nYour choice ultimately depends on your specific workflow needs. If you prefer keeping everything local with advanced organization and tethering capabilities, Lightroom Classic remains your best option. For those who value the security of cloud storage and the flexibility of editing across multiple devices, the Lightroom/Lightroom Mobile combination offers compelling advantages. The video includes additional demonstrations showing the specific interfaces and editing capabilities of each version. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Nace.",

As a journalist, opera singer and speaker, I\u2019ve spent my career helping individuals and businesses build strong brands in the digital age. I\u2019ve also seen firsthand how digital transformation changes the game for solopreneurs and small businesses.\n\nIt can be daunting to figure out where to start when you are a solopreneur. If you are feeling intimidated by the competition, don\u2019t be. This article will break down the universal principles of digital brand-building and the key strategies that can help solopreneurs scale their brands successfully in today\u2019s landscape.\n\nUniversal Principles of Digital Brand Building\n\nSuccess in digital brand-building follows a few core principles: authenticity, consistency and engagement. Big brands may have the resources, but solopreneurs have the advantage of direct connection and authenticity. Today\u2019s consumers trust and follow personal brands because they feel a stronger relationship with individuals rather than corporations.\n\nAuthenticity is being true to yourself and your mission. By sharing your stories, values and experiences, solopreneurs can build trust and deeper relationships with their audience.\n\nConsistency is key to being a recognizable and reliable brand. Regularly delivering valuable content and being cohesive across all platforms means your audience knows what to expect and can trust and recall your brand.\n\nEngagement is not just about broadcasting messages; it\u2019s about creating two-way communication. Actively listening to feedback, responding to comments and creating a sense of community makes your followers feel heard and valued, turning them into loyal advocates. By following these principles, solopreneurs can navigate the digital world and build a brand that\u2019s not just competitive, but deeply connected to their audience.\n\nPlatforms like LinkedIn and Instagram have become essential tools for solopreneurs looking to establish authority and attract clients. LinkedIn has moved beyond a networking site to a publishing platform where individuals showcase their expertise, engage with industry leaders and build credibility. Instagram and TikTok provide direct access to audiences through short-form video content that drives engagement and builds brand loyalty.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\nBeyond content creation, strategic networking is key to digital growth. Mastermind groups, online courses and collaborative partnerships help solopreneurs get visibility and grow their influence. An example of this is Mr Beast\u2019s recent partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo. Mr. Beast partnering with one of the most recognizable athletes in the world not only expanded his reach but also reinforced his brand\u2019s credibility globally.\n\nJust as collaboration elevates brand reach, personal branding helps individuals turn their expertise into profitable businesses. Educators, for example, are leveraging their personal brands to expand their reach and create online group teaching businesses. Elliot Phillips, CEO of the Teacher Project, is part of this movement as a former PE-teacher-turned-entrepreneur, who now helps teachers earn six-figure incomes, all by leveraging their personal brand.This just confirms that you don\u2019t need to be Mr. Beast to make this work; everyday individuals are leveraging these digital tools to their advantage.\n\nThe barriers to entry in the digital space have never been lower. The tools to create, distribute and monetize content are more accessible than ever. The key to success is showing up consistently, delivering value and adapting to industry trends. Related Content\n\nMoreover, the global digital transformation market is projected to reach $3.9 trillion by 2027, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.2% from 2022 to 2027. This significant investment indicates widespread recognition of the importance of digital transformation across industries. For solopreneurs, this trend translates into a wealth of resources and tools designed to facilitate digital brand-building and market competitiveness.\n\nDigital Growth Strategies That Scale\n\nMany solo entrepreneurs think they can\u2019t compete with established brands, but digital transformation has made it possible to scale without big resources. As a solopreneur, you can establish credibility and expand your reach all from the comfort of your home.\n\nIn my case, my journey has been a testament of personal branding. I\u2019ve used my combined talents of journalism, knowledge of AI, and opera singing to get invited to speak and moderate at the world\u2019s top events, from Paris Blockchain Week to Family Office Summits in Lake Como and Monaco. Having such a unique brand has opened doors to these incredible opportunities. Trending Stories Bob Dylan Stuns at 2025 'Rough and Rowdy Ways Tour' Kickoff The Atlantic Releases New Messages ... Which Sure Seem Like Sensitive War Plans \u2018Is Waltz Jonah From Veep?\u2019: Team Trump Fumes Over Its Most Idiotic Scandal Yet A Notorious Twitch Streamer Was Robbed. Why Didn\u2019t Anyone Believe Her?\n\nSince I have the credibility from my written work, the organizers are happy to have me moderate panels, especially on AI and crypto, as those are my areas of expertise. I also get to integrate my love of opera by performing a song or two, which goes well with the high-end audience at these events. This mix of skills has not only expanded my reach but also proved that strategic personal branding can open up unexpected doors, something every solopreneur should consider as they navigate today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nIn this new era of brand building, the biggest risk isn\u2019t change \u2014 it\u2019s staying the same. The only question left is: Are you ready to step forward? If you\u2019ve been waiting for the right time to start building your brand, the time is now. Whether you\u2019re an educator looking to monetize your expertise, an entrepreneur scaling a business or a content creator looking to grow your influence, the digital landscape is endless. The playing field is level. Now it\u2019s not if you can build a million-dollar brand \u2014 it\u2019s if you\u2019re ready to take that first step.",

            "content": "A computer specialist has filed a complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) after being told they had failed the vetting process just before starting work as a technology specialist at MI6\u2019s London headquarters.\n\nThe IT specialist, who Computer Weekly is identifying as RP to protect their identity, claims the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) failed to follow \u201cprocedural fairness\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d when carrying out Developed Vetting (DV) for a full-time role at MI6\u2019s London headquarters.\n\nIn a complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, RP claimed the vetting service was disorganised and delayed the vetting interview for three months \u2013 only moving forward because RP repeatedly intervened to politely ask for the process to be speeded up.\n\nMI6 ultimately denied RP security clearance six months after their initial application for the job. However, the complaint alleges that vetting officers failed to take the basic step of following up on interviews arranged with people who had agreed to act as referees for RP, including a former police colleague.\n\nRP, who is a member of the LGBT+ community, has also complained to the tribunal about multiple attempts to hack their email and social media accounts, made within days of disclosing details of the accounts to the vetting service.\n\nVetting service under fire UK Security Vetting (UKSV), which provides security vetting services for the intelligence services and other government bodies, has previously been criticised by the National Audit Office for its \u201cpoor\u201d performance.\n\n\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) found that UKSV had processed only 7% of Developed Vetting applications within the required time frame, and relied on outdated unreliable computer systems, which lacked capacity, were too slow and required extensive manual workaround, according to a 2023 report. A government spokesperson told Computer Weekly it had addressed the issues raised by the NAO report and had made \u201csignificant improvements\u201d to vetting procedures, with 97% of vetting applications being completed \u201cin line with agreed timelines\u201d.\n\n\n\nRP, an experienced software engineer and team leader, who has worked in private and public sector roles previously, passed Developed Vetting for a senior role in MI6 in 2009 and was surprised not to have passed vetting in 2024. What is Developed Vetting? People applying for roles in M6, GCHQ and MI5 are required to pass Developed Vetting (DV), the most thorough level of security vetting. It is designed for individuals who have long-term, frequent and uncontrolled access to top secret information. Developed Vetting involves checking an applicant\u2019s criminal record, credit reference data and finances, as well as checks against MI5 files and a three-hour interview with the candidate and their friends and relations. Its aim is to build as complete a picture of their life as possible, including their family background, relationships, finances, political views, hobbies, foreign travel and internet use. Candidates are expected to disclose anything that might make them vulnerable to blackmail, which might include sexuality, financial problems and addictions. Those who are found to have withheld information are likely to lose their Developed Vetting status. In a complaint to the IPT, RP argued that the SIS and UKSV failed to follow government guidance, which requires an assessor to take into account \u201call relevant information obtained during the vetting process\u201d before making its decision.\n\n\n\n\u201cA salient point of this appeal is that none of the character referees that SIS\u2019s vetter asked me to set up meetings with reported being contacted to provide a reference. These included senior civil servants and former colleagues in the police service,\u201d according to the complaint. RP said in the complaint that they have no way of knowing what, if any, information led to SIS\u2019s decision not to grant security clearance, but it was clear the vetters had not followed government guidance. \u201cIt seems clear at a minimum that failing to balance any such adverse information (of which I cannot be aware) by even bothering to speak with the referees they asked for is a clear breach of the guidance,\u201d RP wrote in the four-page complaint.\n\nSIS gave \u2018no reasons\u2019 for vetting refusal The complaint also stated that SIS\u2019s Developed Vetting process failed to follow government guidance that states \u201cwhen security clearance is refused, individuals must be informed and provided with reasons where possible\u201d. However, in a letter to RP from \u201cFCO Services\u201d in October 2024, a government recruitment agent told RP: \u201cI regret that we are unable for national security reasons to provide feedback on decisions not to grant DV.\u201d The letter also contained no information on how to conduct an internal or external appeal. According to the complaint, it appears the vetting officer may have used \u201cnational security\u201d as an \u201cexcuse\u201d for failing to complete the Developed Vetting process, or may have made a biased or irrational decision without investigating \u201call of the pertinent facts\u201d. RP has also raised questions about the refusal letter, which arrived on an \u201cFCO Services\u201d letterhead when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been renamed The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) following its merger with the Department for International Development in 2020. \u201cThe lack of accuracy and care in evidence by these mistakes was reflected in the more general lack of accuracy and care taken by this department in carrying out its vetting function lawfully and in accordance with the guidance. If they can\u2019t even get their own name correct, how can they be trusted to get important details right about candidates for DV clearance?\u201d the complaint stated.\n\nApplicant hit by cyber attack RP applied for an IT position with SIS, based at its London headquarters in Vauxhall Cross, in April 2024. By late June, RP had completed interviews and been offered a role. It took a further three months for SIS\u2019s vetters to arrange a Developed Vetting interview, but only after RP had to \u201cregularly lean\u201d on the parties to get the process moving. RP told recruiters in an email that they had traced the IP address used to compromise their Facebook Messenger account to a US address linked to the Russian Federation During an interview on 4 October 2024, RP mentioned that they used an alias to communicate with an elderly relative on Facebook Messenger during lockdown. Some weeks later, RP reported that the social media profiles they disclosed during the vetting interview were subject to repeated attempts by third parties to gain access. RP was able to trace some of the IP addresses used in the attacks to the Russian Federation, some to Vietnam, while most of them came from the US. The only successful attack gained access to the email RP had set up as an alias to communicate with the elderly relative. The IT specialist stated in the complaint that the social media accounts targeted were associated with multiple identities and that there was no obvious indication they were associated with the contractor.\n\n\u2018Barium meal\u2019 \u201cThe only place that I noted these multiple identities as belonging to me was in my DV interview and associated DV form,\u201d the contractor wrote. \u201cIn intelligence circles, this kind of situation is what they\u2019d call a \u2018barium meal\u2019. That is, the source of the attacks can be inferred from the fact that only one entity \u2013 FCDO\u2019s vetting department \u2013 was aware that the separate accounts targeted belonged to the same person. \u201cIt is of concern that multiple social media profiles in different names were simultaneously attacked when the only place these different profiles were mentioned together was during my DV interview.\u201d It is of concern that multiple social media profiles in different names were simultaneously attacked when the only place these different profiles were mentioned together was during my Developed Vetting interview RP The contractor has asked the IPT to investigate whether any attempt was made by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office or any proxy acting on its behalf to access their social media accounts. The complaint also raised questions over the security of personal information gathered about them during DV, and whether there was adequate security in place to protect it from misuse by third parties. \u201cThe effect of my being denied DV clearance without due process is that I am now left with a DV refusal on my record. I was told during my vetting interview that if I didn\u2019t pass clearance, there was no right of appeal, and that FCDO would not change its decision,\u201d RP wrote. \u201cI sold my home of 23 years in anticipation of taking up the role I had been offered with SIS. There are therefore real financial losses associated with FCDO\u2019s actions should IPT find them at fault.\u201d\n\nPrecedent for overturning DV decisions Judges set a precedent for overturning the results of Developed Vetting decisions in 2021 when a judicial review found that Eric Kind, a specialist in criminal justice and UK surveillance law, was wrongly denied Developed Vetting security clearance. Kind had been offered a job as the first head of investigations at surveillance watchdog IPCO, until an objection from MI5, which claimed he was \u201cinsufficiently deferential to the sanctity of confidentiality\u201d, led to his security clearance being withdrawn. Judges found, however, that there was no national security reason why the vetting officer should not have spelled out the concerns raised by MI5 to Kind so he could have provided a focused written response. \u201cThe elephant in the room\u2026is that in this case IPCO\u2019s preferred candidate for a senior position was being refused DV security clearance largely because one of the three agencies which IPCO oversees had strong reservations about him,\u201d they wrote in a 20-page ruling.\n\nDelays and mistakes at GCHQ RP previously experienced delays and mistakes in Developed Vetting after being offered a job as a lead developer with GCHQ, the signals intelligence agency, in January 2021.\n\n\n\nThe IT specialist sent multiple emails to GCHQ and the government\u2019s national security vetting helpdesk after GCHQ incorrectly entered RP\u2019s email into the \u201ceVetting\u201d system. That meant RP couldn\u2019t complete the vetting form and that details of RP\u2019s vetting process may have been sent to an email address belonging to someone else. When GCHQ emailed RP four months later to say that Developed Vetting had been delayed by three months, RP informed GCHQ they had already taken another role. RP continued to receive emails and phone calls from GCHQ asking how vetting was going, despite the IT specialist calling and emailing several times to confirm they no longer wanted the job. In the complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal following their experience at SIS, RP asked the tribunal, at a minimum, to set aside the decision to deny them DV clearance so that it does not remain on their record. \u201cIf the IPT finds in my favour, I would like to be compensated for the loss of employment opportunity that the FCDO\u2019s failing to follow due process has caused,\u201d the complaint adds.\n\nGovernment has made \u2018significant improvements\u2019 A government spokesperson told Computer Weekly: \u201cWe accepted all of the recommendations made by the NAO in 2023 and have made significant improvements to our vetting procedures. In February 2025, over 97% of all vetting clearances were completed in line with agreed timelines.\u201d The government said it does not comment on security matters but maintained that \u201crobust processes\u201d are in place to defend against potential cyber incidents. It has a \u201clong-standing policy\u201d not to comment on matters relating to intelligence and individuals\u2019 security vetting. Government policy is that \u201call staff undergo necessary vetting procedures in accordance with UKSV and Cabinet Office guidance.\u201d According to government practice, \u201creferees are a standard part of the Developed Vetting process, and are contacted as part of an applicant\u2019s clearance process\u201d.",

But Vallejos pointed out the most pressing problem remains helping farmworkers know and defend their rights.\n\n\n\n\"Even if the workers know what their rights are, it's very challenging for them to speak up for themselves, defend their own rights,\" Vallejos explained. \"Because if they're undocumented, they're afraid of being reported to ICE, and I've heard of employers threatening that very thing in order to get people to do what they want.\"\n\n\n\nFarmworkers in North Carolina help harvest numerous crops, including tobacco, cucumbers, apples and bell peppers. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor's National Agricultural Worker Survey found more than 40% of agricultural workers were not authorized to work in the U.S.\n\n\n\nVallejos argued strong enforcement of existing regulations would best help farmworkers. One sort of policy lawmakers in many states could initiate, Vallejos suggested, would be the passage of laws to protect them from extreme heat.\n\n\n\n\"Workers are out there sunrise to sunset. That's a long time to be out in the fields and not get any breaks, not have time in the shade,\" Vallejos contended. \"Employers should be required to be educated on emergency response to heat stress and heat-induced illnesses because that would save lives.\"\n\n\n\nCarolina consumers who wish to support farmworkers, Vallejos added, could try to purchase produce from companies with strong labor standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n\n\nNationwide, it is estimated about one-third of Americans either adhere to Christian Nationalist ideals or sympathize with them.\n\n\n\nGroups working for social justice in Washington state are organizing to counter what they see as a movement harmful to democracy.\n\n\n\nAaron Scott, author of \"Bring Back Your People: Ten Ways Regular Folks Can Put a Dent in White Christian Nationalism,\" is the keynote speaker at this weekend's Peace and Justice Action Conference in Spokane.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated 16% of people in Washington support Christian Nationalist ideas and although it is hardly a majority, Scott said the movement should not be disregarded.\n\n\n\n\"We can't afford to say, 'Well, we're not going to really deal with that stuff, that's a side conversation,'\" Scott explained. \"Because clearly we are now in a moment where it is not a side conversation. It is the central conversation.\"\n\n\n\nScott noted white Christian Nationalist groups embed in rural areas, building churches and securing funds to win local elections. Their beliefs often appear as anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ. He pointed out the ideology thrives where voter suppression and disengagement are high and encouraged people to stay engaged in their communities.\n\n\n\nChristian Nationalists want the U.S. to be declared a Christian nation, with laws based on their far-right values. Though the ideas can seem threatening, Scott stressed arguing with strangers is usually not an effective way to change someone's mind. Instead, he suggested having direct, thoughtful conversations within trusting relationships, reinforcing their values of honesty and compassion.\n\n\n\n\"You can do things like point to the way this person lives their lives and the values that you know they hold, and highlight, like, 'This does not seem aligned with this,'\" Scott advised.\n\n\n\nScott, who also works with the Episcopal Church, emphasized the core of Christianity runs counter to the ideas of Christian Nationalism. He added many Christian groups recognize the movement provides cover for white supremacy and are concerned about the threat it may pose to their religious communities as well as democracy. Scott acknowledged it takes time and commitment to counter extreme ideologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n\n\nIn a nationwide movement, Latinos are being urged to boycott retail stores tomorrow that have curtailed programs promoting fair hiring practices.\n\n\n\nThe diversity, equity and inclusion framework has been a cornerstone for many large retailers for several decades but attacks by President Donald Trump and the GOP have led such giants as Walmart, Target, McDonald's and others to scale back their DEI initiatives.\n\n\n\nCaroline Tso Chen, associate professor of taxation at San Jose State University, said one person might not be able to make a huge difference but if 20% of people joined \"Latino Freeze Day,\" the effect would be substantial.\n\n\n\n\"By basically telling those companies, we do not approve of what you are doing and we will take our money and we will spend it elsewhere,\" Tso Chen explained.\n\n\n\nThe annual purchasing power of Latinos in the U.S. continues to grow, now topping more than $3 trillion. New Mexico is among the top 10 states with the largest Hispanic/Latino buying power, which has increased due to population growth, labor force participation and educational attainment.\n\n\n\nDEI programs have been around since the 1960s and are meant to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups historically underrepresented or subject to discrimination. As an Asian woman, Tso Chen noted she knows what it is like, but added Friday's boycott would need to be just the beginning.\n\n\n\n\"You can't make this just February 28,\" Tso Chen stressed. \"In order to make any sort-of significant economic impact to any of these retailers, it is going to have to be for an extended period of time.\"\n\n\n\nThe Latino Freeze Movement is encouraging supporters to find alternative ways to purchase what they need at other retailers, including local stores, swap meets, farmers markets, secondhand stores or negotiating trades.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n",

His latest project, part of the 2025 Desert X exhibition in Coachella Valley, is a distillation of many of the themes he is interested in, including indigenous building practices, sustainability, organic materials, and contemporary technologies. The project, called Adobe Oasis, consists of an installation of mud passageways made using robotic 3D printing and inspired by the palms of Coachella Valley\u2019s oases.\n\nThe Coachella Valley, best known for hosting the eponymous music festival, is also home to the Thousand Palms Oasis, a fertile area in the desert where palms thrive thanks to underground water sources that are pushed to the surface by the San Andreas fault line. The unique, almost feathery texture of the palms was one of the inspirations for Rael in his Adobe Oasis project. Another key inspiration for the interactive installation was traditional earthen building practices, developed by indigenous peoples for over 10,000 years.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of architectural relics from western expansion and 20th-century real estate development, Adobe Oasis stands as a powerful alternative, highlighting the potential of earthen materials amid the climate crisis,\u201d states Desert X, the international art exhibition that the 3D printed piece is part of.\n\nThe architectural walls are characterized by a corrugated texture created by the robotic arm\u2019s toolpath. The sturdy walls, which rise moderately above people\u2019s heads, form angles and passageways in the way they are laid out. This layout also plays with the light of the Coachella Valley desert and frames a single tall palm tree. In terms of the material, Rael worked with adobe, a traditional building material made from earth, water and organic binder, which brings with it multiple benefits compared to other building materials, including that it is sustainable, fire resistant, non-toxic and low cost.\n\n\u201cAdobe Oasis invites visitors into a dynamic landscape, where passageways frame views of the land and sky, fostering solitude and connection\u2014reflecting the cyclical flow of geologic time,\u201d the project description reads. \u201cFor Rael, this land-based project serves as both an artistic endeavor and a research initiative, with each of his 3D printed adobe structures building on the last, advancing his vision for sustainable housing alternatives.\u201d\n\nOverall, Adobe Oasis bridges traditional building practices with modern technologies, demonstrating a way forward for building that takes lessons from the past. The installation can be experienced in person at Desert X in the Coachella Valley until May 11th, 2025. Some of Ronald Rael\u2019s other projects include Mud Frontiers, a series of four 3D printed mud huts inspired by the historical Rio Grande river, and the 3D Printed Cabin of Curiosities, which explores 3D printing as a solution for producing cladding.",

            "content": "Image Credit:\u00a9 Sebastian Kaulitzki \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nChina\u2019s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for first-line toripalimab (Loqtorzi) in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin) for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1\n\nThe NMPA approval of the sNDA was supported by findings from the multicenter, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 HEPATORCH trial (NCT04723004), which was conducted across 57 centers in mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Findings from the study presented in 2024 at the 27th National Clinical Oncology Conference and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Academic Annual Meeting showed positive results regarding the trial\u2019s primary end points of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with toripalimab plus bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic HCC. The median PFS was 5.8 months with the investigational combination vs 4.0. months with standard-of-care sorafenib (Nexavar; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.525-0.913; P = .0086). The median OS in these respective arms was 20.0 months and 14.5 months (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.579-0.987; P = .0394). Furthermore, the overall response rate (ORR) was 25.3% with toripalimab plus bevacizumab vs 6.1% with sorafenib.\n\n\u201cThe combination of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy has become the foundation of first-line treatment for advanced liver cancer,\u201d Jia Fan, MD, PhD, president, director of the Department of Oncology and Organ Transplantation Center, and a professor of liver surgery at Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai, China; vice-director of the Liver Cancer Institute at Fudan University; and the principal investigator of HEPATORCH, stated in a news release. \u201cThe HEPATORCH study has fully demonstrated the clinical efficacy of toripalimab in [patients with] liver cancer in China\u2026The\u2026regimen combining toripalimab with bevacizumab will benefit many [patients with] advanced liver cancer in China.\u201d\n\nThe combination was also associated with a favorable safety profile, and safety findings from HEPATORCH were consistent with the known safety profile of sorafenib monotherapy. Investigators identified no new safety signals.\n\nHEPATORCH enrolled 326 patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a histological or cytological diagnosis of HCC (or a clinical diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis).2 Patients were not permitted to have received prior systemic therapy for HCC (those who had received prior adjuvant therapy alone who relapsed 6 months or later following their last line of adjuvant therapy were allowed). Patients also needed to have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Child-Pugh class A disease with no history of hepatic encephalopathy, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, a predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, and adequate main organ functions.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive continuous administration of toripalimab at 240 mg every 3 weeks plus bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks; or continuous administration of sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily. Treatment was continued until the occurrence of protocol-specified termination effects.\n\nKey secondary end points included ORR, duration of response, disease control rate, time to progression, and safety.\n\n\u201cBuilding on the success of our previously approved 10 indications\u2014the \u2018Perfect 10,\u2019\u2014toripalimab has reached another breakthrough achievement with the official approval of its 11th indication, and we are extremely elated!\u201d Jianjun Zou, MD, PhD, the general manager and chief executive officer of Junshi Biosciences\u2014the developer of toripalimab\u2014added in the news release.1 \u201cChina has suffered the brunt of liver cancer, and Chinese patients have long faced the challenge of limited treatment options. Junshi Biosciences consistently prioritizes the clinical needs of liver cancer treatment around the world, advancing clinical research through combination strategies tailored to patients across the different stages of disease progression. Our goal is to provide more precise and diverse treatment options for [patients with] liver cancer. Moving forward, we remain dedicated to liver cancer innovation and integrating even greater \u2018Chinese Wisdom\u2019 into the fight against this disease.\u201d\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan\n\nOn Wednesday, March 20, during the second day of the Adobe Summit, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the America's largest bank, took the stage to discuss tariffs, the economy, geopolitics, and his perspective on effective leadership. In a fireside chat with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen , Dimon reportedly addressed an audience of 12,000 marketers, practitioners, and executives, admitting, \"I'm not used to speaking in front of 12,000 people.\"According to a report in Fortune, when asked about his development as a leader, Dimon outlined four key principles. First, he emphasized the importance of honest and direct assessment, stating, \"A lot of companies don't do that,\" which leads to complacency and a lack of transparency about performance. \"Don't try to use numbers to prove what you think,\" he advised. \"Try to use numbers to understand what you are doing.\"Second, Dimon stressed the need for an effective leadership team, warning against those who are disorganized and fail to fulfill their responsibilities. \"They may be great people, just don't let them run something because they'll be a disaster,\" he quipped.Humility was Dimon's third piece of advice. \"People know when you care about them,\" he said, emphasizing the importance of genuineness and treating everyone with respect, from the janitorial staff to the CEO.Dimon emphasized the importance of resilience in leadership, especially when navigating challenges. \u201cYou have to say \u2018absolutely not,\u2019 or \u2018absolutely, take the chance\u2014go for it,\u2019\u201d he said.As the head of a bank managing $4 trillion in assets and moving over $10 trillion daily worldwide with approximately 300,000 employees, Dimon also addressed innovation at scale. He reportedly credited technology as a driving force behind human progress, from agriculture to AI, and emphasized the importance of leadership discussions about technological innovation. Dimon cited Lori Beer, JPMorgan Chase's global chief information officer, who reports to him and the president, as an example of how he engages with his team on questions like, \"What are you doing? What are you building? How are you competing? How are you using new technology? How are you using Adobe?\"",

            "content": "While the Adobe Summit 2025 wrapped up in Las Vegas last Friday, the standout moment came on Day 1 when CEO Shantanu Narayen framed the maturation of AI as the dawn of a \"golden age of design.\" This isn't just about flashy tech; it's about democratising creativity. AI, Narayen argued, is the spark that empowers everyone from corporate marketers, to line-of-business teams, students, and even hobbyists, to craft compelling content, curate standout brand experiences, and unleash imagination at scale.\n\n\"We're expanding the creative aperture,\" Narayen proclaimed during his keynote, emphasising Adobe's mission to turn any flicker of inspiration into multimedia magic. It's a vision where brands elevate their look, forge deeper customer connections, and make creativity accessible beyond the pros.\n\nIn the words of Katrina Troughton, Adobe ANZ Managing Director, \"The goal is to empower our customers to focus on what matters most. Creating engaging, authentic content that resonates with their audience, while our technology handles the complex logistics of content management and distribution.\"\n\nThis ethos of \"creativity as the new productivity\" pulsed through the Summit. Tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Express, are now charged with Firefly generative AI, accelerating digital asset creation while ditching repetitive grunt work.\n\nThe freshly launched Photoshop Mobile (February 2025, iPhone-only for now, with Android on the horizon) puts this power in your pocket, letting creators strike while inspiration's hot. Firefly itself transforms text prompts into images, vectors, and videos using a \"commercially safe\" model\u2014trained on licensed and public assets, customizable with corporate data, and boosted by third-party Creative Plans. It's a creative powerhouse for the masses.\n\nBut Adobe's ambition goes beyond tools and extends to solving real-world challenges. Troughton noted \"When we talk to customers about content supply chain, virtually everyone acknowledges they have challenges, and those challenges can be quite different. Some struggle at the front end of creation, others at the publishing stage, and some with content reuse.\"\n\nAdobe's response? A flexible framework. \"We need to start with an overall solution but then drill down to what's specifically relevant for each customer,\" Troughton added. \"It's about building a roadmap that addresses their unique pain points.\"\n\nThat roadmap shines in Adobe's portfolio. Acrobat's AI Assistant turns static PDFs into interactive hubs, spitting out visuals and pairing seamlessly with Adobe Express for user-friendly design.\n\nMeanwhile, the Adobe Experience Platform ties creativity to marketing muscle, offering real-time insights to tweak campaigns on the fly. \"Our customers want to create emotional connections, delight customers, and drive greater loyalty,\" Narayen said. Troughton echoes this: \"Our portfolio is designed to help customers simplify and streamline their content processes.

            "content": "Releases ten AI agents purpose-built on AEP Agent Orchestrator, to help marketing and creative teams to drive personalisation at scale.\n\nThe platform\u2019s new built-in agentic functionality aims to make it easy for marketers to use purpose-built AI agents for a range of tasks\n\nAdobe unveiled Agent Orchestrator solution for its marketing and customer experience platform, Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) at the recently held at Adobe Summit, its flagship digital experience conference.\n\nThe platform\u2019s new built-in agentic functionality aims to make it easy for marketers to use purpose-built AI agents for a range of tasks. These include optimising websites, handling repetitive content production tasks such as resizing, refining target audiences, creating and optimising channel experiments, and scaling content and digital media production.\n\nAt the conference, Adobe also launched Brand Concierge, an evolved version of transactional chatbots and web-based agents to a brand-centric agentic app that aims to offer a personalised brand concierge experience to every customer.\n\nBuilt on AEP Agent Orchestrator, Adobe Brand Concierge allows businesses to manage AI agents that guide consumers from exploration to purchase, using immersive and conversational experiences. Supporting text, voice, and image interactions, it will deliver AI-driven recommendations. For instance, on a brand website, the \u2018brand concierge\u2019 will go beyond providing general product information to delivering tailored content based on the existing account relationship, while handling tasks such as booking follow-up meetings. These capabilities will optimise the sales cycle by generating more leads and boosting conversion through personalisation.\n\nEach year, AEP helps activate over one trillion experiences, enabling companies to connect real-time data and enhance customer experience. Adobe\u2019s AI innovations aim to reshape how businesses connect with customers and how marketers deliver impactful customer experiences. The new offerings are powered by Adobe\u2019s AI platform that unites AI agents and models across Adobe. This includes third-party AI agents, safe Firefly models, secure third-party models, and first-party data insights, integrated into Adobe\u2019s applications.\n\nAEP unifies customer experience data, CX language models and AI agent orchestration. Adobe is unifying marketing and creativity through its AI platform to deliver personalised experiences at scale.\n\nAnjul Bhambhri, senior vice president of engineering, Adobe Experience Cloud, said, \u201cAgentic AI is a leap forward that will accelerate workplace transformation. Adobe\u2019s latest innovations will drive productivity gains for practitioners to free up time for creative ideation, while unlocking capacity for marketers to scale personalisation through purpose-built AI agents.\u201d\n\nAEP Agent Orchestrator is developed based on a deep, semantic understanding of enterprise data, content and customer journeys through Adobe Experience Cloud. This enables agentic AI solutions built for businesses to deliver targeted and immersive experiences. The solutions include data governance and regulatory compliance as built-in features.\n\nAdobe Experience Platform (AEP) Agent Orchestrator aims to help businesses to build, manage, and orchestrate AI agents from Adobe and third-party ecosystems. Based on AEP, these agents have a deep understanding of customer data and content to help improve decision-making and support multiagent collaboration. As AEP data is brought under experience data model schemas, which derive meaning from unrelated data and enables impactful customer experiences, brands can shorten time to value. AEP helps manage and activate billions of audience profiles presently.\n\nAdobe also launched 10 experience platform agents that will help marketing and creative teams to drive personalisation at scale. Built on AEP Agent Orchestrator, these agents promise to increase team capacities by enhancing category-leading applications, such as Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP), Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Journey Optimiser and Adobe Customer Journey Analytics.\n\nAccount qualification agent supports enterprise business-to-business (B2B) objectives by evaluating and advancing new opportunities to build sales pipeline and engage key members of a buying group. Audience agent analyses cross-channel engagement data to create and optimise goal-based, high-value audience segments, which can then be activated for wide-scale personalisation campaigns. Content production agent helps marketers and creatives achieve scale by generating and assembling content based on a brief, while adhering to predefined brand guidelines. Some of the other agents cover areas such as data insights, data engineering, experimentation, journey, product advisor, site optimisation, and workflow optimisation.\n\nA new generation of consumers is seeing value in having conversational experiences with their favourite brands. New insights from Adobe Analytics show a 1,200% increase in traffic to US retail sites from generative AI sources (AI-powered chat services) in February 2025\u2014and a 1,700% increase to travel sites\u2014as consumers looked for purchase guidance, inspiration, and available deals. AI agents will be able to handle complex tasks and make tailored recommendations including personalised trip planning or helping shoppers find the perfect product or service.\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe has tied up with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide new solutions for marketing and creative teams. Under this partnership Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) will connect to AWS\u2019s generative AI, Amazon Connect, and Amazon Ads to allow organisations personalise their client interactions and improve omnichannel experiences. The deal will also help Adobe's clients to leverage AWS\u2019s secure infrastructure while using Adobe's solutions. Adobe\u2019s Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) aims to help businesses activate first-party data for personalised marketing, without depending on third-party data. The collaboration with Amazon Marketing Cloud will help improve ad targeting and performance. Under this tie-up, Adobe Creative Cloud applications will also integrate with Amazon Ads to organise creative workflows. AEP-powered applications will also be available on AWS Marketplace.\n\n(Source: Campaign India)",

With 200+ sessions, keynote appearances from industry heavyweights like Jamie Dimon, and bold announcements from Adobe, the event set the tone for what\u2019s next in customer experience.\n\nThe opening day focused heavily on marketing measurement, with multi-mix modeling taking the spotlight. As privacy regulations limit access to user-level data, brands are turning to hybrid models that combine the precision of multi-touch attribution (MTA) with the predictive power of media mix modeling (MMM).\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Fospha, a key sponsor, stood out by offering a unified solution that delivers privacy-first, full-funnel insights \u2014 helping brands reallocate spend dynamically and understand ROI without cookies.\n\nMeanwhile, sessions on AI and automation highlighted Adobe\u2019s Smart Plus campaigns (built with TikTok), showcasing how AI is now automating everything from creative testing to cross-platform campaign scaling.\n\n\ud83d\udecd TikTok x Adobe also introduced seamless commerce integrations, underlining the shift toward high-impact, real-time engagement strategies.\n\nDay 2 brought the big guns. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, joined Adobe\u2019s Shantanu Narayen to talk leadership, resilience, and the economic outlook \u2014 a grounded take amidst all the tech optimism.\n\nAI became the central character:\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Adobe\u2019s AI-powered agents were shown helping marketers with audience segmentation, journey optimization, and experimentation in real time.\n\n\ud83c\udfe8 Marriott shared how AI-driven incentives increased customer engagement \u2014 surfacing the value of micro-personalisation.\n\n\ud83c\udfe2 Omnicom demonstrated operational wins, using AI to automate workflows, forecast campaign breakdowns, and train underperforming teams \u2014 turning marketing into a smarter, leaner machine.\n\nThe final day explored the role of agentic AI \u2014 autonomous tools embedded into workflows that optimize performance across customer journeys, content creation, and even audience refinement.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Adobe\u2019s Firefly updates expanded generative AI into video editing and localization, while the Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator showed how marketers can manage multiple AI agents seamlessly.\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 In a standout interview, Comwrap Reply\u2019s Tim Conrad and Luke Barton shared how AI is transforming enterprise marketing: from multilingual asset generation to real-time content adjustments, they detailed how AI is shaving weeks off production cycles and delivering measurable results.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Their Co-Pilot tool now auto-tags and organizes massive libraries of campaign assets \u2014 reducing friction between teams and making large-scale, omnichannel activation faster and easier.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 What We Learned\n\n\u2705 AI is the new co-pilot \u2013 Marketers no longer have to choose between speed and personalization. AI lets them do both \u2014 at scale.\n\n\u2705 Personalization is non-negotiable \u2013 From journey orchestration to dynamic content, brands must tailor experiences or risk irrelevance.\n\n\u2705 Measurement is still a pain point \u2013 But players like Fospha are helping marketers finally connect the dots between strategy and performance in a cookieless world.\n\n\u2705 AI + Human = Winning Combo \u2013 AI is augmenting, not replacing, marketing teams. The opportunity lies in combining automation with human creativity and judgment.\n\n#SXSW - EVENT INSIGHTS\n\nWhat does great advertising look like in 2025? Insights from SXSW, paired with fresh data from NCSolutions and commentary from industry leaders like L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Join Han Wen and NBCUniversal\u2019s Josh Feldman, suggest it\u2019s about balance\u2014not just performance.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Top Insights:\n\nCreative still reigns supreme , contributing 49% to incremental sales\u2014quality content matters more than ever.\n\nBrand-building is gaining ground , rising from 15% to 21% in sales impact since 2017. It\u2019s about community, trust, and long-term love.\n\nTargeting has become smarter , now contributing 11%, while the importance of broad reach has declined.\n\nMeasurement is critical. As Han Wen put it, don\u2019t chase \u201cfalse precision\u201d\u2014track full-funnel impact to see the big picture.\n\nTiming still matters. Recency remains a consistent 5% driver\u2014ads need to hit at just the right moment.\n\nThe verdict? Long-term brand connection + short-term performance = sustainable impact.",

Here is a breakdown of their recent trades and their value.\n\nIn a significant move, Director Robert K. Burgess has offloaded a substantial number of Nvidia shares, totaling 53,324. This transaction, valued at a whopping $6,158,388, highlights a notable shift in the holdings of Nvidia\u2019s top executives. The sale could be indicative of Burgess\u2019s strategic financial planning or a response to market conditions, and it certainly draws attention to Nvidia\u2019s current market standing and future outlook.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s VP of Corporate Strategic Planning, Darrin L Talley, has also made headlines with the sale of 2,100 shares, amounting to $237,300. This transaction might reflect Talley\u2019s personal financial strategy or a broader trend within the company. As Exxon Mobil continues to navigate the complexities of the energy sector, such insider transactions are closely watched by investors for potential insights into the company\u2019s strategic direction.\n\nAbbVie has seen a significant insider transaction as well, with EVP & CFO Scott T Reents selling 17,644 shares for a total of $3,746,526. This sizable sale could signal Reents\u2019s confidence in diversifying his portfolio or a reaction to AbbVie\u2019s current market performance. Investors will be keen to see how this move aligns with AbbVie\u2019s financial strategies and market positioning.\n\nUber Technologies has witnessed a flurry of insider activity, with CLO and Corporate Secretary Tony West selling 46,866 shares worth $3,308,055, and SVP and Chief People Officer Nikki Krishnamurthy selling 20,000 shares for $1,431,200. These transactions, totaling over $4.7 million, suggest significant insider confidence in liquidating holdings at current market valuations. Such moves are often scrutinized for their implications on Uber\u2019s operational strategies and market expectations.\n\nIn a contrasting move, Adobe\u2019s Director Daniel Durn has purchased 1,300 shares, investing $507,752. This acquisition signals a vote of confidence in Adobe\u2019s future prospects and growth potential. As Adobe continues to innovate and expand its digital offerings, Durn\u2019s purchase may reflect optimism about the company\u2019s strategic initiatives and market resilience.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "In supply chain and logistics, uncertainty is the only constant. Tariffs come and go, shifting with political landscapes and economic strategies. While predicting their exact trajectory is impossible, one thing is certain: supply chains must be prepared to adapt, and last mile will bear the brunt of these changes.\n\nThe last mile\u2014the most complex and expensive leg of the delivery journey\u2014feels the immediate impact of any disruption in the supply chain. When tariffs force businesses to shift sourcing strategies, manufacturing locations, or distribution centers, delivery networks must adjust in real-time. Without the right technology and network visibility, shippers risk inefficiencies, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction.\n\nThe ripple effects of tariffs\n\nWith North America\u2019s tightly integrated supply chains, U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico\u2014and the retaliatory tariffs those countries impose in response\u2014create significant disruptions for last-mile logistics. Many U.S. businesses rely on cross-border suppliers, manufacturers, and distribution centers, so any trade friction directly impacts fulfillment and delivery.\n\nTo offset increased costs, businesses may relocate production or shift to new suppliers, which in turn forces changes in distribution routes and inventory management strategies. For last-mile operations, this could mean:\n\nDelays at border crossings. New tariffs often come with additional customs checks, paperwork, and regulatory hurdles that slow down cross-border shipments. Delivery providers must be able to reroute shipments or adjust delivery windows dynamically.\n\nShifts in fulfillment strategies. Retailers and brands may move warehousing and distribution centers domestically to avoid cross-border costs, requiring last-mile providers to adjust networks and capacity accordingly.\n\nE-commerce disruptions: Many U.S. consumers buy directly from Canadian and Mexican retailers, expecting fast shipping. Higher tariffs could lead to increased prices, reduced demand, and a change in delivery volume patterns that last-mile providers need to adapt to.\n\nIncreased costs on high-volume imports. Goods like automotive parts, electronics, and agricultural products frequently cross North American borders multiple times before reaching the end consumer. Tariffs increase costs at each stage which may push retailers and brands to look for efficiency gains elsewhere, putting pressure on last-mile providers to optimize routes and pricing to remain competitive, without sacrificing service quality.\n\nVariable demand patterns. Shifting suppliers may lead to fluctuating delivery volumes, requiring logistics providers to scale operations up or down quickly.\n\nAdaptability is the competitive edge\n\nThe businesses that will thrive in this shifting environment are those with flexible, technology-driven last-mile logistics. To keep up, companies must embrace a network approach\u2014approaching their delivery ecosystem holistically\u2014as a dynamic, interconnected system rather than a series of isolated transactions. This requires:\n\nReal-time visibility. Without live tracking and data analytics, companies are flying blind. Advanced last-mile technology enables full visibility into where goods are, how routes are performing, and where bottlenecks are emerging.\n\nWithout live tracking and data analytics, companies are flying blind.

Whether from trade policy, natural disasters, or consumer demand shifts, the ability to pivot and optimize operations in real time will determine success. The last mile is where this flexibility is most critical\u2014and where technology is no longer optional but essential.\n\nAs companies reevaluate their supply chain strategies, those investing in adaptable, tech-driven last-mile solutions will gain a decisive edge.

            "content": "WHILE attending the Adobe Summit in Las Vegas, I experienced firsthand the energy and innovation that serves as the engine for Adobe's expanding portfolio of solutions. As a user of Adobe Photoshop for the last 30 years, this summit helped me see the big picture of Adobe's ecosystem beyond the artistic tools I use.\n\nOne thing I learned from the summit is the much-needed focus on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in transforming the customer experience (CX). Adobe just launched the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Agent Orchestrator, a cornerstone of its vision to unify data, automate workflows, and provide real-time insights to elevate customer experience management. The company also built Customer Experience Language Models \u2014 enhanced AI models that leverage CX data to refine and expand AI agent capabilities, adding a semantic understanding of customer experience on top of general-purpose large language models (LLMs). The ten purpose-built agents announced are Site Optimization, Product Advisor, Content Production, Account Qualification, Audience, Data Insights, Data Engineering, Journey, Workflow Optimization, and Experimentation.\n\nAI-driven automation for smarter CX\n\nOne of the key themes at the summit is how AI-powered orchestration is beyond traditional data management. Adobe's AI agents can now manage complex, multi-step, repetitive tasks requiring substantial manual effort and marketing know-how. Through simple conversational prompts, businesses can automate processes \u2014 driving efficiency and agility.\n\nA question I asked before the summit: what skills will be required for customer service professionals in the age of AI agents? Prompt engineering and efficient collaboration with AI tools are needed. Adobe has integrated a dedicated AI agent into its customer service application. Resolving complex customer issues takes around two weeks from the initial report to identifying the root cause. With the AI agent, this timeline is expected to improve by automating root cause analysis, allowing customer service teams to focus on higher-value tasks like prompt engineering. The aim isn't to replace human involvement but to empower customer service teams by using AI to resolve issues quickly.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFor example, Adobe confirmed that the new Audience Agent significantly reduces the time required to create targeted audience segments, cutting the process from 4 to 5 days to an hour or less. The Site Optimizer Agent, which integrates with Adobe Experience Manager Sites, constantly crawls websites for performance and technical issues, including everything from broken links to SEO shortfalls, and recommends solutions. Automating these tasks allows teams to concentrate on strategic priorities, improving productivity and responsiveness. Adobe is also embedding generative AI throughout its broader ecosystem. Adobe GenStudio, designed for performance marketing, integrates with LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads, and Microsoft Advertising to help teams quickly create and distribute branded content. The Content Production Agent, embedded in GenStudio, further streamlines enterprise content workflows, ensuring consistency across marketing channels.\n\nMarketing with more intelligence, personalization\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journey Agent enables marketers to rapidly design personalized journeys by automatically generating about 80 percent of the template, significantly reducing manual effort and deployment time. A conversational AI interface is embedded within Adobe's new Brand Concierge. This AI assistant draws on live CX data to offer individualized conversations rather than traditional chatbots that rely primarily on scripted responses or historical logs. In sectors such as hospitality and retail, it can provide personalized recommendations based on historical actions and preferences, facilitating a smoother and more applicable client interaction.\n\nImproved data governance, strategic collaborations\n\nAs AI adoption expands, strong data governance becomes increasingly critical. Effective governance allows organizations to safely deploy tailored AI solutions within trusted enterprise environments, reflecting Adobe's ongoing commitment to data privacy and compliance.\n\nAdobe's AI strategy involves partnerships with Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, and other leading technology companies to enhance its capabilities further. The AI agents will integrate with Microsoft Copilot within Microsoft Teams, enabling marketers to streamline workflows and leverage AI-powered automation in collaboration environments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext era of AI-driven CX\n\nMoving forward, Adobe plans to improve its AI-enabled customer experience by adding to and fine-tuning its network of ten specialized AI agents. The company stressed that AI is not simply another technology but a shift in how business gets done. That focus, in turn, is shaping product development at Adobe and validating its investment in the growing field of AI-powered customer experience management. By introducing the Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator, Adobe aims to integrate AI-powered automation into enterprise workflows, streamlining processes and enabling more personalized experiences across various scales.",

            "content": "While half of the Vegas megaconference grapples with implementing current generative offerings, the other put a flag in the sand for AI\u2019s much-vaunted next phase.\n\nLas Vegas, a neon beacon in the desert, has always been a symbol of humanity\u2019s (putative) triumph over nature. It\u2019s appropriate, then, that it has become the home for a major stop on the speaking circuit for what has become the species\u2019 latest evolutionary obsession: AI.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Adobe Summit has descended on Vegas\u2019s Venetian resort \u2013 a hotel, casino and conference center with remarkable ambitions of its own. In homage to the \u2018floating city,\u2019 there are indoor canals complete with gondolas and stripey-topped gondoliers, parades of luxury \u2018shoppes\u2019 and more places to eat, drink and gamble than any reasonable person would attempt to count. Since 2023, this has all been watched over (literally \u2013 at time of writing, this writer\u2019s hotel room is overlooked by what appears to be an enormous yellow bouncy ball) by the great and powerful Vegas Sphere, nestled right in the hotel\u2019s backyard.\n\nThe conference\u2019s environs, in other words, are as larger-than-life as you\u2019d expect from, perhaps, the maddest city on the planet. And though its themes are a more sober affair, they\u2019re no more ambitious.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nThat ambition is simple: Adobe wants to cement itself as the leader in AI-enabled creativity across the entire marketing ecosystem.\n\nSpeaking at a pair of keynotes this week, the creative software company\u2019s chief executive Shantanu Narayen declared a \u201cgolden age of design\u201d enabled by AI, which has been rapidly \u201cexpanding the creative aperture\u201d for marketers and designers over the last couple of years.\n\nAdobe has been a major player in that rapid expansion of AI capabilities, most notably with its family of generative models, Firefly, which was announced two years ago and the focus of last year\u2019s keynote. This year, the expected further developments of Firefly, including the launch of generative video, were nestled into a concept-heavy list of announcements as the San Jose tech giant sets out its stall for brands entering the AI revolution\u2019s third phase.\n\nIs agentic AI here?\n\nThe show\u2019s splashiest announcement: 10 new \u2018AI agents\u2019 that the firm will roll out across its suite of products, underpinned by an \u2018agent orchestrator\u2019 (on which more later). That list of 10 includes an \u2018Audience Agent\u2019 designed to aid with campaign targeting, a \u2018Data Insights Agent\u2019 designed to connect up disparate data sources and a \u2018Site Optimization Agent\u2019 for website performance tuning.\n\nCurrently in beta testing with clients, the agents will be rolled out to customers in the coming months, with both how they\u2019re commercialized and which products they\u2019ll operate within varying across the range. Also announced: \u2018Brand Concierge,\u2019 which deploys that agent orchestration tech for customer service apps.\n\nThis hard launch into agentic AI is not unprecedented. In the rapid AI hype cycle, the tech has gone from speculative possibility to product catalogs in just a few months, with Adobe\u2019s competitors across its myriad business areas announcing their own offerings, including B2B software giant Salesforce last September, data storage company Snowflake in November and Amazon Web Services (AWS) this year.\n\nFirst, there was descriptive AI, then generative, now agentic. This third phase, in Adobe\u2019s formulation at least, is characterized by significant upticks in AI models\u2019 interactivity and reasoning capabilities. Most significantly, an AI agent is plugged in across systems to take action rather than making recommendations on a single plane.\n\nJoe Stanhope, a principal analyst at Forrester, is not surprised to see things are moving so fast around agentic. \u201cTwo years ago, in the generative AI explosion, a lot of people got caught off guard,\u201d he tells The Drum. \u201cThis time around, as agentic AI comes around, there\u2019s a lot of people who have resolved to not get burned twice. So it feels like it has suddenly snapped into place.\u201d\n\nAt this early stage, Stanhope says, approaches to and definitions of agentic AI remain varied. Salesforce\u2019s approach (\u2018Agentforce\u2019), for example, is more \u201cplatform-oriented,\u201d offering a development environment for clients to create their own agents. What\u2019s distinctive about the Adobe approach is its practicality: 10 agents aimed at marketers\u2019 real problems.\n\nIn this way, Stanhope says, the Adobe approach is keeping one foot grounded in the existing AI reality: \u201cThese might not yet fundamentally change the way marketers work or what they do; it\u2019s really about streamlining and making existing processes more effective and that should yield benefits. But as we build more of these agents and as you look at some [future] capabilities they\u2019re laying out, like the ability to run multiple agents together and to connect to third-party agents and data \u2013 that portends a world where agents are far more automated and autonomous.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with The Drum, Ely Greenfield, chief technical officer of Adobe\u2019s digital media business, acknowledges that \u201ca lot of people can\u2019t even define what authentic is still.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonalization, personalization, personalization\n\nBut agentic and generative AI alike are just tools \u2013 tools that Adobe says it\u2019s developing in pursuit of \u2018personalization at scale.\u2019 In his keynote address, Adobe head honcho Shantanu Narayen declared the company\u2019s mission as \u201cto change the world through personalized digital experiences.\u201d\n\nA further raft of announcements around the tech giant\u2019s \u2018content supply chain services\u2019 aim at making marketing personalization available to a wide range of brands, both through AI-generated creative and through workflow and planning tools to enable the shift. It\u2019s a shift that, according to the conference, is already well underway. In one keynote speech, Hilary Cook of the hotel group Marriott said that the firm has already multiplied instances of personalized content by a factor of 4,200, with content variations in the tens of millions.\n\nNumbers like that, and the pace at which they\u2019re achieved, are the sorts of stats that make some marketers nervous. Not least those working in reversioning, translation and marketing execution. This is a concern that a number of speakers at the conference are tackling head-on, developing the theme of AI as a copilot that will free up its human collaborators to think more strategically.\n\nSo, while the easiest ways to understand the capabilities of such tools are quantitative, Camila Nakagawa, global executive vice-president at Havas\u2019s \u2018content at scale\u2019 agency, Prose on Pixels, argues that we should focus instead on the qualitative improvements it can bring to heavily iterated content. \u201cIt\u2019s not about creating more but better content\u201d, Nakagawa says. \u201cPersonalized content unlocks creativity. It\u2019s a big opportunity for our teams to spend their time and effort on what\u2019s really worth it\u2026 [We work with] retail brands that have to generate hundreds or thousands of different posts. I\u2019m sure our copywriters would rather spend their time on something different. And when we talk about AI executing manual work on, say, resizing images, I think our art directors would rather spend their time and their knowledge working on something different.\u201d\n\nAdobe / The Drum\n\nOn the main stage, the chief executive of The Coca-Cola Company, James Quincey, spoke to the dual promise and trepidation around this dream of mass-scale personalization. \u201cThe cheaper it gets to make gen AI, the cheaper it gets for me to put you in the ad. The next stage is to say, \u2018You looked at your phone but you didn\u2019t buy the product\u2019 and it goes back to a bunch of humans and they say, \u2018What can we do?\u2019\u2026 Well, if it\u2019s cheap to redo the ad, I\u2019ll just make a few changes, like an A/B test, and keep changing until you click \u2018yes.\u2019 So the lower the cost of the ad, the more I can set up gen AI plus an intelligent agent to chase you until you click yes. But at the other end of the spectrum will be a whole bunch of annoyed consumers going, \u2018This is like Minority Report\u2026 I want to buy one of those acts that block everything!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrchestrate this!\n\n\u2018Orchestration\u2019: not, perhaps, the sexiest word, but a candidate for the most oft-spoken word on the lips of Adobe reps this week.\n\nIf agentic AI is the firm\u2019s big tech bet and personalization at scale is its promise to brands, this idea of orchestration is the gel between the two.\n\nOn the main stage earlier this week, the president of Adobe\u2019s digital experience business Anil Chakravarthy said: \u201cThis is now the era of customer experience orchestration, where your content, customer data, your journeys, are all working hard with AI and so you anticipate what your customers want. You engage in natural language conversations across any channel. You respond in real-time and you continuously delight them.\u201d\n\nThe vision is of agentic AI as a centralized intelligence between all of the channels, software and campaigns that make digital marketing so complicated, like a conductor in an orchestra. Speaking of all those software, what is perhaps most distinctive about this approach is the range of partners Adobe is bringing into the orchestra of which it hopes to sit in the middle. Announcements this week included a deepened partnership with Publicis through the latter\u2019s digital consulting arm, Sapient, and its own AI suite, CoreAI, and with Microsoft\u2019s AI \u2018companion\u2019 co-pilot. Even direct competitors are brought into the tent, with a \u201cstrategic collaboration\u201d announced with AWS.\n\nLongstanding partnerships across the ad business, including with behemoth WPP. So, while concerns in the ad world that the AI paradigm may shift ever more power to tech vendors like Adobe may well be exacerbated by seeing the latter\u2019s AI agents in action, it is keen to strike a collaborative note. One such collaborator is agency Monks, whose global executive vice-president of martech platforms and innovation Remco Vroom says that agencies and brands still \u201chave a big transformation ahead of them.\u201d\n\nThe push for personalization and high-quality, high-volume content, Vroom says, may feel like it\u2019s coming from inside the industry \u2013 but really, it\u2019s being generated by real people\u2019s sky-high expectations. \u201cEverything needs to be these fast, super niche experiences. We\u2019re getting all of these really great, faster-to-market, hyper-personalized services and we expect that from everything and everybody. So companies need to redesign what their role is in in the whole value chain of products and services.\u201d\n\nFor Vroom, if the era we\u2019re entering is one of potential marketing abundance \u2013 a hyper-personalized ad for every consumer, generated instantly, stored in an endless (if expensive) reservoir of data, iterated until \u2018perfect \u2013 then the challenge for marketers comes down to exercising choice. Warning of one client that already uses only 20% of the assets it creates and the threat that unguided AI \u201cmakes things really vanilla \u2013 it gives you all shades of gray but it can\u2019t give you pink,\u201d Vroom says that marketers will have to think differently about how they engage and instruct AI.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, per se, do things just because you can.\u201d",

            "content": "Spread the love\n\nThere\u2019s a problem with street photography that I think that many don\u2019t understand: it\u2019s not necessarily photojournalism. However, because of the lack of standardization in the field, it results in lots of different ethical conflicts. This could be seen as problematic because of how little media literacy there is with social media. On the other hand, it limits what\u2019s possible for artists. But something that\u2019s often been hotly debated is whether or not the use of Photoshop is allowed in street photography. So we talked to a few photographers about it after a statement made on behalf of Adobe.\n\nAll images in this article are used with permissions from the photographers.\n\nPhotoshop in Street Photography\n\nCommuters on the New York City Subway, NY, NY. Credit: Gretchen Robinette with permission granted in previous interviews.\n\nSomething that experienced and passionate photographers alike could find odd is that even though technology has improved over the years, photography itself hasn\u2019t majorly changed. With the new Photoshop Mobile, Adobe approached some of the photographers they work with for quotes when we asked them how it helps photographers make better photos. Our Adobe Rep, who wanted the communications we had attributed to Adobe in general, provided the following to the Phoblographer:\n\n\u201cI really love street photography, and it\u2019s actually how I got started. To me it\u2019s just so pure. No set, no models. Just you, your camera, and your perspective. And with Photoshop on iPhone, I can quickly take my photos where the real magic happens \u2013 the edit. Photoshop on iPhone lets you use powerful features like the Remove Tool, Generative Fill, adjustment layers, and advanced color grading\u2026\u201d Tej Patel\n\nGiven Tej\u2019s portfolio, most wouldn\u2019t call them a street photographer \u2014 but, without seeing invoices, we can\u2019t deny Tej\u2019s credibility as a working photographer. Tej\u2019s website shows work with lots of different clients whom we can assume have paid Tej for services.\n\nToday, no one would deny how good smartphones are as cameras. We can look at a series like Gretchen Robinette\u2019s Unlimited Metrocard as proof of that. The series has been featured by prominent publications. \u201cSmartphone technology has advanced to a level where it now delivers powerful, innovative workflows for creative work, allowing photographers to refine and enhance their photos with the same precision and versatility as desktop tools, all from the convenience of their phone,\u201d Adobe told us. \u201cPhotoshop\u2019s new mobile app is purpose built for phones. It was designed from the ground up to welcome a new generation of image and design enthusiasts to the limitless potential of Photoshop in an easy-to-use mobile interface.\u201d Powering this is the commercial-free assets from Adobe Stock.\n\nPhotoshop Mobile is going after aspiring photographers who don\u2019t attend classes \u2014 assumedly so. The tool is letting those creatives make their own images and us features like retouching, generative fill, Lightroom integration, clone stamp, lighten, darken, etc. \u201cThe next generation of creators, as well as experienced creative professionals who want to make unique digital art on mobile, can now get started with Photoshop faster and easier than ever before,\u201d says Adobe.\n\nLots of these tools are available and are easy to use, but what\u2019s concerning is that brands like Adobe don\u2019t consider also teaching and positively reinforcing ethics when it comes to using these tools. Instead, their use has continued to make matters like authenticity much worse. For that, Adobe has the Content Authenticity Initiative \u2014 which the Phoblographer is a member of. But it\u2019s not marketed anywhere as sexily as a few feature in Photoshop.\n\nThoughts from Photographers\n\nThere are many different schools of thought when it comes to editing and Photoshop usage in street photography. Lots of photographers didn\u2019t believe in doing any editing \u2014 even cropping. Diane Arbus famously is one of those who didn\u2019t want to do anything else besides basic developments in the darkroom. And in many ways, her traditions are being upheld. Photographers like both Richard Bram and Teri Vershel both do very minimal editing according to our previous interviews. Many photographers often say that they only do things that they would\u2019ve been able to do in the darkroom.\n\nA person and a large brindle dog stretch on a street with murals and a crowd in the background. Credit: Eric Davidove with permission in previous interviews.\n\nThere\u2019s also a side of street photographers that think that Photoshop and editing are totally ethical in street photography. We can\u2019t forget about the famous case of Steve McCurry; but we also should remember the genius that is Diado Moriyama. In Moriyama\u2019s mind, the camera is an imperfect way of capturing the world. And so if it\u2019s already imperfect, the interpretation is solely that of the photographer\u2019s. For this reason, he embraces photo editing as an essential part of his work. Granted, Moriyama\u2019s work can be seen by many to be very weird \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t be art if we didn\u2019t feel something.\n\nThe reason why McCurry\u2019s situation is so unique is that folks didn\u2019t think that he edited his photos. But he came out later to say that he never said he didn\u2019t. Instead, it was just assumed by the public \u2014 who thought of him as a photojournalist.\n\n\u201cPhotoshop is acceptable for street photography provided that it is used to make acceptable edits,\u201d states street photographer Eric Davidove, whom we\u2019ve interviewed many times here at the Phoblographer. \u201cStreet photography does not necessitate truthfulness, honesty, or an accurate depiction of a scene, akin to Photo Journalism. Street photographs can be surreal or misleading, suggesting multiple narrative interpretations.\u201d He clarifies this statement by saying that acceptable edits include the following:\n\nCropping\n\nAdjusting brightness, exposure, and contrast\n\nAdjusting color tone, saturation, and hue\n\nAdjusting clarity and sharpness\n\nFixing lens distortion and alignment\n\nDodging and burning to highlight or reduce areas of the image\n\nRemoving small defects such as water spots or dust spots\n\nHowever, this does not imply that you should alter or remove crucial elements of the composition. Nor does David believe one should excessively manipulate the image, compromising the integrity of the original. Essentially, he believes that whatever could be done in the darkroom to a single image alone without composites or anything like that is perfectly acceptable.\n\nPeople in a street parade, focusing on a person in a leather outfit on a wheelchair, surrounded by a cheerful crowd. Credit: Meryl Meisler with permission in previous interviews.\n\nThe legendary street photographer Meryl Meisler also uses Photoshop for good reason. \u201cStreet photography documents time, place, culture, history, and more, she states. She continues to explain how Photoshop saved her images:\n\n\u201cMy slides from the 1980s and 90s Bushwick were stored in boxes near a damp basement wall. Many of the transparencies had dust, and some even had green mold spots or hairlines. Kodachrome kept its color well, but Ekathrome \u201cfaded\u201d or color shifted. So, I use Photoshop to retouch dust and mold and color correct them as I recall the setting. Like traditional analog film photography, dodging, burning, and cropping are ethically appropriate to enhance the print. However, if a person uses software to alter, eliminate, or add content, I would not consider that \u201cstreet photography.\u201d It becomes street-style-influenced digital imagery.\u201d Meryl Meisler\n\nOther photographers, like Melanie Einzig, only use Photoshop. Specifically, she cites to us that she only uses Photoshop RAW to process her photos.\n\nAll anyone remembers in the end is the final shot. Manipulating reality through photography can lead to many issues in a world where people don\u2019t know how to verify the authenticity of an image. There is the CAI for that. But then there is also Google searching, Flickr searching, Instagram searching, etc.",

            "content": "Some people and companies may wonder if agentic AI is all hype, but there are already some interesting applications in the tech industry\u2014Adobe is no exception.\n\nAmit Ahuja, SVP of Experience Cloud, Platforms, and Products, Digital Experience at Adobe, walked me through the firm's new Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator and several of the new Experience Platform Agents to demonstrate how Adobe is embedding agentic AI throughout the Platform.\n\nAdobe\u2019s AI journey\n\nIf you follow Adobe, you know it\u2019s been on a journey to use AI to transform its products and platform for many years now, with generative AI being the newest AI capabilities. Last year, it introduced the AI assistant, which enabled conversations over enterprise data. However, Adobe\u2019s customers want more than a Q&A. The aim is that AI takes on and finishes complete tasks and does them smarter and faster. This is where the Experience Platform Agents and agentic reasoning come in.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s understand how Adobe defines an agent because, let\u2019s face it, it means different things to different companies. In Adobe\u2019s case, an agent is:\n\nIt\u2019s interactive. It engages in a two-way conversation with a human and understands and responds to input in real time.\n\nIt reasons. Adobe agents go beyond pre-programmed rules. It understands context, interprets user intent, and reasons through complex problems. And it makes decisions. The agent has learned from the company\u2019s enterprise data and the knowledge base.\n\nIt\u2019s autonomous. It can take action instead of only providing high-level guidance or explicit insights. It can execute tasks, automate processes, and make changes to systems or content.\n\nAdobe\u2019s agent orchestration works within the Adobe Experience Platform, co-ordinating the actions of one or more agents. Ahuja says the firm looked at where the bottlenecks were for marketers and focused the agents on more complex use cases. It also works across the broader ecosystem. Adobe is committed to agent interoperability and helping others extend and customize experiences and workflows based on their specific needs.\n\nThree pillars of Adobe\u2019s agent strategy\n\nAhuja pitches the three pillars of Adobe\u2019s agent strategy as:\n\n(1) Helping practitioners do more\n\nStreamlining tasks, automating processes, and providing intelligent recommendations are ways the agents work for practitioners. Ahuja talks about Audience Agent, Journey Agent, and Experiment Agents, all of which create, optimize, and manage the audience, journey, or experiment. The agents work on a combination of fine-tuned LLM and Adobe\u2019s proprietary knowledge.\n\nThe Audience Agent can be used to create a new email campaign. The agent is prompted with a goal and responds with options and a plan. It can recommend a new audience or suggest an existing audience based on inputs from the marketer. It can do propensity modeling and predict how much of that audience is likely to convert. The agent works with connected datasets, including the CDP, customer journey analytics, and more. At every point, the marketer has the ability to select the audience, request changes, move forward, or even move backward and have the agent re-evaluate.\n\nAt every decision point, the agent clearly explains its reasoning and recommendations, including the data sources used, how the model was trained, and what factors drove predictions.\n\nAhuja says the core constructs of agentic reasoning\u2014planning, verification, and backtracking\u2014are built into all agents. He said it is necessary for humans and AI to work together.\n\n(2) Transforming customer experiences\n\nThis pillar focuses on helping marketers create engaging, personalized customer experiences using agents. The Brand Concierge (Phil Wainewight talks about this here) is an example of an agent in this pillar.\n\nThere are two parts to the Brand Concierge agent. There\u2019s the setup of an experience and the delivery of that experience to the customer. The marketers defines a goal and based on connected data the agent recommends strategies and content. It can also create the experience, both visual and content, following brand guidelines, and it can personalize the experience of customers using known information. The marketer can adjust what the agent creates at every point. The second part is the actual delivery of that experience - a virtual assistant (agent) the customer uses to help them do something. The example provided here was a virtual assistant that helped a customer customize their vacation trip.\n\n(3) Enabling the ecosystem and developers\n\nAdobe provides APIs and tools for developers to create their own agents and interoperate with the Adobe agents. The Adobe Marketing Agent is a great example. It integrates with Microsoft 365 Copilot and is available in applications like Word, Teams, and PowerPoint, essentially embedding Adobe marketing capabilities directly into the 365 workflow.\n\nFor example, after a team meeting for a new campaign, inside Office 365, a marketer can request that the Marketing agent draft a creative brief, provide audience recommendations, suggest content, and create a project workflow in Adobe Workfront. And the agent can do this by analyzing the transcript, and integrating with the necessary Adobe applications. Marketers can be in Office Copilot during and after the campaign and request performance reports, analyze journey data and recommend improvements, and draft PowerPoint presentations for reporting.\n\nCoca Cola\u2019s journey into agentic AI\n\nRapha Abreu, VP of Global Design, and Shekhar Gowda, VP of Global Marketing Technology at The Coca-Cola Company, joined Ahuja to share some insights on Coca-Cola\u2019s AI journey (Madeline Bennett's write-up of the session can be found here). Ahuja said the company has some of the most agile thinking about implementing AI.\n\nAbreu\u2019s design team is responsible for ensuring the brand storytelling remains iconic worldwide, balancing timelessness with timeliness across every touchpoint. So, his job is to develop brand guidelines that define how global brands should look or visually behave worldwide. When generative AI came in, they were in the process of shifting from static to more dynamic guidelines. But they needed to do more. They needed a design system that allowed for creative flexibility to support a global presence but infused local relevance but remained consistent with the brand.\n\nBrand consistency is paramount for us, and the more we scale, the greater is the risk of misinterpretation of brand guidelines that can lead to loss in brand fit and ultimately a bad quality execution. [...] We needed an AI-enabled system that didn't just replicate designs, but deeply learned and truly understood what makes Coca-Cola look and feel like Coca-Cola, right?\n\nThat\u2019s what Project Fizzion does. Powered by Firefly services and a custom model, Project Fizzion lets designers create intelligent, dynamic design systems from original designs. Designers create their layouts in Adobe Creative Cloud, Fizzion learns everything they are doing and codifies it into a new style ID and applies it across different applications of the design. The agent isn\u2019t replacing designers; it\u2019s ensuring their vision is fulfilled, executing it across potentially thousands of applications.\n\nGowda said scaling is important for the company, but it was essential to do it in a way that maintains the integrity of the brand across everything. He also doesn\u2019t believe that AI replaces creativity - it enhances it. Coca-Cola believes in a human-led approach where designers lead, and AI follows.\n\nAnother interesting point Gowda made was o emphasise the truism that AI is not a silver bullet. You must start with a clear problem to solve and define AI\u2019s role carefully.\n\nMy take\n\nWhat I saw related to Coca-Cola's use of AI and design was interesting, and the way the Audience Agent reasoned out and built a new audience was pretty cool. But, the Marketing Agent embedded in the Office 365 CoPilot caught my attention the most.\n\nAs companies start to dive into using agents and tech providers build agents on top of their products and platforms, it\u2019s the interoperability that I haven\u2019t seen much of yet. That\u2019s partly because the tech providers are still trying to figure out how to create agents that work within their own systems. And some are creating multiple agents that don\u2019t talk to each other. Trying to figure out how to design them to talk with agents outside their ecosystem is a bigger, broader initiative.\n\nAdobe is there, working with partners like Microsoft to build interoperability between systems and agents. Plus, you\u2019re working with an agent in line with the tools you use every day. You don\u2019t have to move between tools to get work done - that is a key productivity hack. Tech providers can build all the agents they want, but if they are still requiring multiple interfaces and multiple agents that don\u2019t talk to each other, they\u2019re missing the point.",

            "content": "As an airline with just 45 planes, Virgin Atlantic isn\u2019t able to compete on scale. Instead, the business has always focused on building its brand and differentiating itself from the competition via customer experience (CX).\n\nThis ranges from the little touches, like getting children on board to hand out sweets at the end of the flight, to letting travellers pre-select their on-board meal. Now, the company is looking to data and AI to extend its CX so that every interaction with customers is unique and different. Simon Langthorne, Head of CRM, Virgin Atlantic, explains:\n\nObviously our customers are at the center of everything that we do, but it's how we can supercharge that from an experience perspective that we we're looking to deliver. By understanding our customers even better through the data that we collect, we're able to provide a better experience at different touchpoints they have on a journey.\n\nThis might be leaving a business customer alone to be able to work, or making sure support and plenty of snacks are available for a family, to making it feel special for a couple going on their honeymoon. Langthorne adds:\n\nIt\u2019s how can you use data to drive a better understanding of what motivates and drives customers, what do they expect from the service, products, flights and resources we provide.\u201d The extra touches Virgin Atlantic is able to provide today are traditional, in the sense that the airline obtains some data, delivers some insight, understands a pain point or potential opportunity within the journey, and then delivers those experiences as a result. The pre-ordered meals on planes are an example of this, ensuring customers get the meal of their choice and aren\u2019t disappointed on-board; and as a result, cabin crew can do a faster meal service because they know what to serve to various customers.\n\nFuture lies this way\n\nThe next objective is to deliver more of these experiences in a way that can scale, and that's really systematic. Langthorne says:\n\nImagine we held all your preferences about all the meals that you've ever had. I know that you're a vegetarian, so why would I ever give you options of various different meals that we have that you're never going to eat.\n\nBy building up a much more comprehensive data profile around its customers, and enabling smarter tools, this could enable AI to curate the type of experience Virgin wants to give its customers.\n\nThe challenge now is to use the power of the data it\u2019s gathering directly and drive that into a different type of unique customer experience. Langthorne notes:\n\nDoing that at scale is really hard when you've got 300 people on a plane. To give 300 people on the plane a completely unique experience is incredibly challenging, but you can do it in a way where you can start to group similar characteristics together: this group of customers is more likely to respond well to being left alone versus these customers need more attention.\n\nAnother area Virgin is interested in is being able to link historical profile information with some of the more real-time interactions with customers at the airport or on the plane via Wi-Fi. This isn\u2019t something the airline is doing today.\n\nVirgin uses a range of Adobe tools to run its business, including Target, Audience Manager, Campaign, Analytics and Experience Manager. The airline also rolled out Adobe Experience Platform last year. The implantation was completed within five months, and there was a rapid turnaround in terms of developing some simple use cases. Langthorne explains:\n\nIt was more based on commercial drive around return on investment to start with and building out more personalized journeys based on web interactions and some of our historical data as well. We are now looking at how we can build that out into more of our customer-facing channels, so with the digital stuff we're building and scaling, how can you also build it out into some of the physical touchpoints.\n\nIt is also using Adobe technology to make some improvements to its Flying Club loyalty program, which will be ready in about a month's time. From a contact center perspective, the airline is using Adobe technology so when customers call, the system knows if it\u2019s a Flying Club customer and it can reduce call-handling times. Langthorne says:\n\nYou get straight to the customer's question rather than having to go through a whole load of security questions.\n\nRegarding the newer AI capabilities Adobe unveiled this week at its Summit, Langthorne says that while Virgin is using AI within the business, it's more based around processes than it is customer experience, using tools like Microsoft copilot and Genesys in the contact center. It has been looking at more advanced tools like Adobe Firefly, but it hasn\u2019t yet unlocked the ability to connect together AI-generated content. Langthorne explains:\n\nThat's some of the challenges that we have at the moment, how we can connect together some of that Generative AI content in a way that's truly scalable, and truly engaging as well. We have our brand guidelines, the way we create content, it's crafted in a very thoughtful way based on the brand guidelines and we need to make sure that whatever else is crafted, whether it\u2019s AI or not, it adheres to those things. That's the bit we haven't cracked.\n\nRegarding the other AI capabilities Adobe launched at Summit, Langthorne says the airline is definitely interested in the translation, forecasting and predictive elements, but the question now is how to use AI innovation in a commercial way.

Prior to its investor event, the San Jose, California-based company on Tuesday released a fleet of new announcements related to its AI initiatives, including new products and partnerships surrounding its \u201cFirefly\u201d platform \u2014 a suite of generative AI models which enable image and video generation, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nAdobe is \u201cincredibly well positioned to capitalize on the massive AI opportunity on the horizon,\u201d CFO Dan Durn said during the investor day presentation according to a transcript. \u201cArguably, the best positioned.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs well as the new capabilities related to its Firefly platform, Adobe also announced new integrations with Amazon Web Services, and a move to bring AI agents into Microsoft\u2019s Copilot as part of an existing collaboration between the two companies.\n\nThe aim to incorporate AI across all aspects of the company\u2019s products comes as the software provider looks to reassure wary investors that its investments in the technology will reap compelling rewards.\n\nInvestments in AI contributed to surging revenues for its most recent quarter, with Adobe reporting $5.7 billion in revenue for its Q1 ended Feb. 28 \u2014 a 10% rise year-over-year, the company said last week. Annual recurring revenue for the company\u2019s standalone and add-on AI products reached $125 million at the end of the quarter, with Adobe projecting that figure will double over the next nine months.\n\nDespite strong results, however, the company\u2019s stock price slumped about 14% following its earnings report on March 13, as skeptical investors remained unconvinced Adobe was showing a clear path to AI monetization, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nBoth Narayen and Durn took pains to address AI monetization concerns in their Thursday remarks, pointing to growth and rising engagements for solutions such as its Firefly platform.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing strength with creative and marketing professionals, and you can see it in usage and engagement,\u201d Durn said. \u201cCustomers, they are generating over 1 billion Firefly assets every month.\u201d\n\nThe question of AI\u2019s monetization or return on investment is looming large for many companies and their CFOs, as both AI vendors and users weigh the technology\u2019s present costs against its potential gains.\n\nROI is at the center of the tug-of-war between executives contemplating AI\u2019s risk versus its rewards: a recent study by Big Four accounting firm KPMG found technology ROI is the main sticking point between the finance and IT functions, CFO Dive sister publication CIO Dive recently reported. Nearly one-third of CFOs stated technology innovation spending is excessive, according to the survey, compared to only 16% of chief information officers.\n\nAdobe\u2019s executives are confident that the technology will be a key driver of future growth, they said during the investor presentation.\n\n\u201cAI monetization, our innovation, it\u2019s infused across the breadth of our products, and it\u2019s influencing billions of ARR,\u201d Durn said Wednesday. \u201cAnd you can see the impact. New users, more usage, better retention, more value. And that\u2019s only going to continue as AI becomes an increasing driver of Adobe\u2019s growth.\u201d",

What if, when you finished a complicated data analysis, the slides to present that analysis literally made themselves? What if you could change the platform your site uses \u2014 and even redesign its pages \u2014 with just a few clicks?\n\nAt Adobe Summit 2025, the flagship digital experience conference, the popular Sneaks session provided a glimpse into a future in which AI agents, marketing and creativity technology come together to help businesses orchestrate impactful customer experiences quickly and easily. With teams operating in an environment in which the bar for personalization and digital content production keeps rising, Sneaks presenters \u2014 Adobe scientists, engineers, product managers and designers \u2014 presented a vision for ways AI can unlock capacity, boost efficiency and help teams capture the massive opportunity of personalization at scale. Many Sneaks eventually become shipping Adobe products and features.\n\nThe Sneaks this year showcase how data innovations and AI agents can assist with marketing workflows across campaign launches and content production. These forward-looking projects provide a view into additional use cases that fit into the broader suite of agentic AI capabilities Adobe announced this week. Built on Adobe Experience Platform, purpose-built, out-of-the-box AI agents can be leveraged by marketers to optimize websites, handle repetitive content production tasks and refine target audiences \u2014 or to interact directly with customers via a concierge experience.\n\nAdobe\u2019s latest innovations drive Customer Experience Orchestration (CXO) in the era of AI. As the evolution of Customer Experience Management, CXO fulfills the promise of personalization at scale by combining the creation and development of seamless and connected customer experiences across all touchpoints, leveraging advancements in generative and agentic AI.\n\nHere are this year\u2019s Sneaks:\n\nProject Perfect Context\n\nWe all know that you can have a great campaign encouraging travel to New Orleans, but if the meteorologists are warning about a possible hurricane, few people will come. Of course, the external factors that affect your campaigns aren\u2019t always as obvious as a hurricane and that\u2019s why brands often have blind spots when it comes to factors in the macroenvironment. Project Perfect Context can help teams better understand their customers through deep data analysis, powered by an AI agent. It pulls external insights \u2014 like economic data, cost of goods sold, major announcements and more \u2014 directly into Adobe Customer Journey Analytics in Adobe Experience Platform and merges it with first-party behavioral data. Analysts can then use a conversational AI agent to analyze and explain the combined data sets, providing new insights on the broader context that impacts customer behavior. With these insights, a brand can be more informed when building customer experiences that are relevant and compelling.\n\nProject Slide Wow\n\nPulling together a comprehensive data analysis can be challenging enough. But creating a visual presentation that makes that data clear and helps leaders make decisions can sometimes take as much or more time. Project Slide Wow can assist by transforming data in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics automatically into a digestible visual format \u2014 and streamlining the work that goes into data storytelling. Practitioners can easily export the data to create a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, with both data visualizations and speaker notes. If those practitioners needed more information covered in the presentation, they can just ask Project Slide Wow a few questions and it would deliver additional slides on the fly.\n\nProject Vision Cast\n\nBringing new products or campaigns to market requires deep collaboration between marketers and creatives, and it is important for teams to be aligned during the ideation stages to avoid delays. Project Vision Cast can combine the power of data insights with brand imagery to create rough interpretations of new products via generative AI \u2014 and support tighter cross-team collaboration. The images (along with supporting data on past content performance) are sent to Adobe\u2019s Project Concept, an AI-first application to foster the creative brainstorming process. It can provide early visualizations (backed by insights on what performs) to help creative and marketing teams execute engaging campaigns that achieve business goals.\n\nProject Site Leap\n\nFor brands, changing content management systems or redesigning a site can mean costly and extended disruptions to the everyday work of marketers \u2014 ultimately impacting the customer experience across their digital channels. Project Site Leap can simplify the process. It uses an AI agent that analyzes images, then connects with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to update content automatically. In seconds, the agent can analyze existing brand webpages, import content into AEM and even restyle pages to align with new design mocks. This ensures that if a brand has to change their technology systems or look and feel, teams have uninterrupted access to the channels that drive customer engagement.\n\nProject Get Savvy\n\nFor many brands, creating marketing campaigns from ideation to deployment can be a complex and time-consuming process. Project Get Savvy can streamline the early stages of this process through AI agents, helping any marketer quickly develop a campaign plan. Marketers can interact with multiple AI agents in real-time to generate compelling content and visuals, determine the best channels to reach target audiences, and then create personas of the target audience for feedback. These AI agents can support campaign planning from end to end, enabling teams to move faster.\n\nProject Frame Sense\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like arriving at a hotel and being greeted by someone who really knows you \u2014 what you like to do, what you love to eat. But it can be challenging and time-consuming for brands to deliver tailored experiences at scale. With Project Frame Sense, teams can leverage real-time customer insights from Adobe Experience Platform and connect it to video content. This allows teams to create uniquely personalized videos \u2014 that speak to individual preferences and drive travel inspiration \u2014 with generative AI-powered digital avatars that add another compelling element.\n\nProject Panorama\n\nDriving mobile performance hinges on a deep understanding of user engagement, but it can be challenging for marketers to grasp all the components (messages, offers, screens) that shape the customer experience. This inhibits the ability of teams to make impactful changes. Project Panorama can provide a new way of understanding the user experience via Adobe Journey Optimizer, creating a visual map of a mobile app journey (that also updates in real-time). It can outline each page of the customer experience, tracking performance metrics and user behavior. Marketers can leverage these insights to better orchestrate new messaging and offers straight to the mobile app from Project Panorama \u2014 without any coding required \u2014 and elevate the user experience.",

Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nEvery year during Adobe Summit, the company gives the public a sneak peek into its latest experimental innovations, with 40% of them historically making it to actual rollout. In the past, some of Adobe's most popular features were first revealed as part of Sneaks, including Generative Fill, then dubbed Project Fast Fill.\n\nAlso: Adobe reveals 10 purpose-built AI agents -- here's what they can do for your business\n\nThe Sneaks are proposed by Adobe employees and build on Adobe's existing offerings to optimize creatives' workflows. Unsurprisingly, this year, most of the Sneaks finalists involved AI agents that can help marketers and brands alike. To get a glimpse into Adobe's future, keep reading below.\n\nProject Perfect Context\n\nThis experiment would help teams better understand their customers through an AI agent that can combine external insights, such as economic data and global weather, with first-party behavioral data within the Adobe Customer Journey Analytics in the Adobe Experience Platform, according to the post.\n\nAlso: AI tools are increasingly driving traffic to retail sites, Adobe Analytics finds\n\nUsing the AI agent, users can learn more about customer experiences by conversationally asking questions that leverage more information about both datasets. These insights can ultimately inform the building of future experiences to cater more to the audience's wants and needs, ultimately improving campaign performance.\n\nProject Slide Wow\n\nSlide decks are a great medium for presenting information, but building them can be time-consuming. Senior leaders, in particular, often bear the burden of synthesizing robust data insights into presentations to share the findings with other teams. Project Slide Wow automates the entire process, converting data in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics into an engaging visual Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that includes visualizations and even speaker notes.\n\nAlso: Forget Sora: Adobe launches 'commercially safe' AI video generator. How to try it\n\nThe presenter can then ask a question and get an answer pulled straight from the dataset, even if it wasn't originally included in the slides. In the live demo at Sneaks, the presenter converted a dataset of favorite ice cream flavors into a visually engaging and well-organized PowerPoint presentation with different sections, charts, speaker notes, and even a concluding slide with questions. It kept a theme and natural order that drove the point.\n\nSabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nProject Site Leap\n\nContent management systems play a central role in many businesses' core operations. Yet even when these systems are outdated or no longer the best fit, companies often struggle to make a change due to the high costs and potential disruption to their workflow. As the name implies, Project Site Leap makes the transition easier using an AI agent that can take existing brand pages, import the content into Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), and align it with new design mocks, according to Adobe.\n\nAlso: Adobe Acrobat's AI Assistant can now decipher complex contracts for you\n\nIn the demo, the presenter switched an open-source blog into AEM by asking Project Site Leap to \"Onboard the site to AEM,\" and was able to import all of the content into AEM within seconds. Then, the second step was to reproduce the design of the blog into AEM, and again, it was able to do it within a second. Lastly, the presenter asked the AI agent to freshen up the images and the typography, and again it was able to do so. If you want to change the design entirely but keep the content, you can also upload a mock-up and have the agent transform the old content into the new style.\n\nProject Get Savvy\n\nThis experiment is the ultimate tool for marketers, helping them through their kickoff campaigns by aiding the brainstorming, creation, and deployment of a campaign through the use of various AI agents. With Project Get Savvy, marketers would be able to interact with agents in real time to create content and visuals, find the best ways to reach audiences, and even create personas that resemble the target audience and get their feedback.\n\nProject Frame Sense\n\nTaking a step away from agentic capabilities, the next couple of experiments focus on using generative AI to deliver value to marketers and their audiences. Project Frame Sense helps marketers create tailored experiences in the travel and hospitality sector, where creating tailored experiences is specifically worthwhile.\n\nAlso: Adobe Photoshop adds Live Co-editing for more productive team work\n\nThe experiments connect customer insights from the Adobe Experience Platform with video content so that customers can receive a highly personalized video tailored to their preferences. The videos even use AI-powered digital avatars. As seen in the image below, in the demo, the presenter took an AI avatar of Sneaks host Eric Matisoff, Principal Evangelist of Analytics & Data Science at Adobe, to create a personalized video for co-host Ken Jeong that took into account Ken's interests, such as what food he wanted to eat on the trip.\n\nSabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nProject Panorama\n\nProject Panorama helps brands make sense of user interactions on mobile applications. This task is typically challenging because of all the different elements found in apps, such as screens, offers, and messages. Instead, Project Panorama would offer a map that brands can use to visualize the user's journey.\n\nAlso: Adobe's new AI feature lets you edit stock images on the fly -- no Photoshop needed\n\nThe map would update in real time, track performance metrics and user behavior, and outline each page and screen of the experience, according to Adobe. Ultimately, marketers could use those insights to deploy new offers and send messages from the Project Panorama interface without additional code, making optimization to increase user engagement easier.\n\nProject Vision Cast\n\nThis project focuses on making the collaboration between marketers and creatives more seamless. Using generative AI, it combines data insights and brand imagery to create rough interpretations of new product concepts. These interpretations are then sent to Adobe's Project Concept so both teams can brainstorm and collaborate.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",

Ahead of Adobe Summit kicking off tomorrow, we're gearing up for a busy few days of news and announcements, so be sure to check back later for updates.\n\nWe've collected our badge ready for an action-packed day tomorrow, which kicks off with an Opening Keynote headed up by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, CMO Lara Balazs and other execs. Adobe Summit 2025 registration desk (Image credit: Future)\n\nGood morning \u2013 we're up bright and early for today's action-packed itinerary. We'll be off to the keynote in a couple of hours before heading off into different breakouts and press briefings to hear what's new from Adobe.\n\nJust as a reminder, the opening keynote will be hosted by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, CMO Lara Balazs and other execs. We'll also doubtlessly hear from customers and fans alike - should be a good one!\n\nWe've been escorted to the press area ready for the opening keynote session where we'll hear from Adobe executives and customers about the future of customer experience with an emphasis on creativity, marketing and AI. (Image credit: Future)\n\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen welcomes attendees to the company's 23rd Summit. \"Creativity is the new productivity,\" he said as he summarized the latest AI announcements. (Image credit: Future)\n\n\"Creativity is a uniquely human trait,\" Narayen explained as he stressed how AI will enhance human output before he welcomed Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience and Worldwide Field Operations, to tell us where Adobe's heading.\n\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey share a Coke Zero as Quincey explains how he modernized the beverage giant from within, beginning with favoring jeans over a suit and tackling the traditional hierarchical company structure. (Image credit: Future)\n\nAnil Chakravarthy has introduced Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator for Businesses, including 10 new purpose-built agents supercharge capacity and eliminate bottlenecks. Chakravarthy promised more agents will be coming soon before showing us how one of the 10 launch agents, the site optimization agent, can help keep a website operating at peak performance by finding opportunities to enhance the site and then executing those autonomously.\n\nAdobe CMO Lara Balazs explained how marketing is harder than ever, but personalization at scale holds the key to success. \"If they don't get on board, they're going to be left behind,\" she added.\n\nDigital Media Business President David Wadhwani echoed Balazs's comments: \"The best way to stand out is through personalization.\" He noted how speed to market is imperative, adding that the efficacy of social media campaigns typically drops off after just one week. GenAI can plug the gap where budget growth doesn't keep up with demand for more content.\n\nResponding to customer demand, Adobe is adding new video editing tools to Firefly services, including aspect ratio changes and language translation \u2013 set to be one of the most impactful changes creatives and marketers can benefit from with mammoth time-saving benefits.\n\nAdobe lifted the wraps off three new Firefly Services APIs in general availabliity: Translate and Lip Sync API for instant translation of spoken dialog into different languages, Reframe API to resize videos for different platforms and Custom Models API to ensure newly created assets are on-brand. Additionally, the Substance 3D API will enable teams to bring together 3D objects with Firefly-generated backgrounds to accelerate content production, but this one's in beta.\n\nWell that's a wrap on the opening keynote, which covered a lot of ground very quickly. To recap, we heard about updates to Firefly Services including new APIs and custom models for creating high-quality, on-brand assets and the newly launched Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator and Brand Concierge app for building and managing Adobe and third-party AI agents. Agentic AI is very much the theme of Adobe Summit 2025.\n\n\"The demand for content is insatiable,\" reads a slide presented by Adobe Express Director Pierre Tapia and SVP and GM Govind Balakrishnan to a small group of the press, citing research revealing that 90% of marketing leaders believe the demand for content will increase 2x in the next two years (50% by 3x). The company's new AI tools can help companies repurpose existing assets leading to quicker time to market and a reduction in net new assets (and therefore cost).\n\nProbed about the effects of artificial intelligence on designers, Balakrishnan noted that Adobe's tools help creatives become more productive, adding that the company doesn't view any of its products as replacements for humans. AI also has the power to \"dramatically lower the barrier to entry,\" he stated. Tapia added that creatives would rather spend more time on ideation, creation and inspiration. GenAI tools can help increase the velocity of content while creating a \"productivity dividend\" that the creators can take to be more strategic.\n\nFamiliar challenges like cost and trust continue to slow down AI adoption, but IBM Consulting Global Chief Design Officer Billy Seabrook reckons change management is what's really stopping companies from realizing the benefits of AI. Preparing and re-training the workforce is the biggest thing companies can do right now not to get left behind.\n\nAfter a short break, Amit Ahuja, SVP of Experience Cloud, Platform and Products, Digital Experience is joining us on stage to unpack everything AI from this morning.\n\n\"We're moving from experimentation to implementation,\" Ahuja said about agentic AI.\n\nTwo more leaders from Coca-Cola are here to talk about how they use generative AI to fuel content production for the group's 200 brands in over 200 countries. They haven't touched their Coke Zeros yet, maybe they're just there for product placement?\n\nCoca-Cola VP Rapha Abreu stressed the importance of a clearly defined AI strategy. His colleague and fellow VP Shekhar Gowda added the companies who see the highest levels of success are the ones that define AI's role carefully. \"When you are defining your AI strategy... the key is to establish a human lead approach, where designers, creatives, humans, in general, lead and AI follows,\" Abreu said.\n\n\"What do enterprise software agents and sudoku solvers have in common?\" Adobe VP Shivakumar Vaithyanathan explains how agentic AI reasoning follows the same principles as human reasononing \u2013 planning, verification, and then backtracking. We just had to understand and define that in order to make AI more autonomous.\n\nWell that's a wrap on today's keynote content. We're off for a chat with Joshua Young, Head of EMEA Sales GTM - Content & Collaboration, now. We've got two more keynotes scheduled for tomorrow plus a sneak peak at some products in development, so come back for that all day tomorrow.\n\nGood morning from day two of Adobe Summit 2025! After yesterday's opening keynote, we're getting ready for the second major address later this morning, so stay tuned for all the latest news and updates as they happen...\n\nIt's breakfast time here at Adobe Summit 2025. We're still a couple of hours away from the main keynote session but we're hoping to hear plenty more thoughts and ideas in the meantime.\n\nAs we wait for today's keynote to start, let's remind ourselves of some of the announcements we've already heard: Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator \u2013 a new platform for building, managing and orchestrating AI agents\n\nIt will also integrate with partners like AWS, IBM, Microsoft, SAP and more\n\n10 new purpose-built AI agents \u2013 including site optimization and content production agents\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Sites Optimizer \u2013 a new application to automate issue diagnosis and solution recommendations to capture more web traffic\n\nAdobe GenStudio Foundation \u2013 a new interface to bring together campaign plans, projects, assets and insights from across Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud apps\n\nThe audience is flowing in as we gear up for the second keynote of Adobe Summit 2025.

(Image credit: Future)\n\n\"Treat your own employees like the customers,\" JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon says as he envisions a world where companies makes their workers' lives easier by deploying the right tech solutions.\n\nChatting on stage with JPMorganChase Jamie Dimon, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen asked the leader how the banking giant approaches AI. Dimon explained that the company has always been about \"big math,\" so AI was just the next logitcal step. JPMorganChase first used AI in 2012, and the company now has 2,000 employees working on its own AI. An estimated 700 use cases for AI are now observed within the company, with the most popular being fraud detection, risk analysis, prospecting and document summarization. Echoing endless studies published in recent years, Dimon added that getting the data in an accessible form is the hard part.\n\nThe audience applauded as Dimon declared that consumer data should be their own data \u2013 it shouldn't belong to banks, healthcare institutions, etc.\n\nAnjul Bhambhri, SVP, Adobe Experience Cloud is here to tell us how Adobe is supercharging the company's AI Assistant with agents, which she describes as \"intelligent and autonomous.\" Users will continue to engage with them through conversations, but they'll go beyond answering questions by \"doing things for you.\" You have to tell them what you want want, highlight goals and costraints, and AI agents will proactively make suggestions and fill in gaps, Bhambhri adds.\n\nHow AI agents get to work is really simple, Bhambhri explains. The process starts by analyzing user input, then the agent reasons with your intentions before generating an orchestration plan.\n\nSpeaking about agentic AI, \"You are always in the driver's seat, and you have an autopilot that you can switch on,\" Bhambhri added.\n\nIn a live demo, Rachel Hanessian, Senior Manager of Product Management, Generative AI just extended her imaginary three-day hotel stay with Marriott after seeing a targeted email to offer her discounts on local attractions. This was powered by Adobe's new AI Assistant tools, she explains, as she shows us the behind-the-scenes.\n\n\"When my daughter goes online shopping for tops, the Brand Concierge can recommend the colors and styles that match the pants she bought in store a few weeks back,\" Bhambhri explained.\n\nHilary Cook, VP, Global Marketing Operations at Marriott, asked the audience if they're \"excited to implement what we're seeing\" at Summit. AI is \"not a silver bullet for fixing decades of debt\" but it's an \"incredible amplifier if you're willing to do the right work,\" Cook explained as she addressed the disparate processes that plague every company.\n\n\"We're now in the tens of millions of variations,\" Cook said after the company adopted Adobe's product suite. Marriott has also seen a 70% reduction in time to market for campaign content generation. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThat's it for today's keynotes. We're off to chat with more people from Adobe before we take our seat again to hear what's cooking in the labs at Adobe HQ.\n\nWe've just had a chat with Anjul Bhambhri, SVP, Experience Cloud Engineering, Digital Experience, who is a firm believer that companies must try AI to understand its pros and cons, and how it might be able to help them. Much like saying you don't like broccoli when you haven't even tried it, experimentation with emerging technologies is key.\n\nAdobe Digital Trends Report shows that two in three (64%) are seeing increased productivity and efficiency. The same number are seeing greater volume and speed of content ideation and production. Every year, the report reveals ROI is increasing.\n\nYou can now buy sheets, mattresses and scents you experience at Marriott hotels so you don't have to steal them, company SVP, Marketing, Data Activation and Personalization, Chris Norton jokes on stage as he sets up to tell us how the hotel chain is using artificial intelligence to understand how customers engage the its 30 brands.\n\nSiloed marketing teams, goals and content plagued Marriott until it went all-in on Adobe Experience Platform, Norton declares. Its Adobe investments are just the tip of the iceberg, though. He says that talent investments, content acceleration, a solid data foundation and rethinking the ways of working are all just as vital for an effective digital transformation.\n\n\"Sell the vision but set the expectations,\" Norton advises for companies looking to get the C-suite on board. \"This is a journey that's never truly done,\" he adds.\n\nThe countdown is on for Summit Sneaks in two hours, where we're promised demos of new features that may or may not end up in our Experience Cloud products in the future. Actor, comedian and producer Ken Jeong will also be bringing the laughs.\n\nWe're here at a very lively Sneaks to hear what Adobe's got planned for us next, and the party is in full swing. (Image credit: Future)\n\nSneak #1: designers can turn sketches into images powered by Firefly, with changes updating on the fly\n\nSketch-to-image struggling to interpret your substandard sketches? You can also feed it text prompts just to make your intentions that little clearer.\n\nSneak #2: Patent-pending Project Panorama goes one step further to help developers map their apps and customized in-app experiences to help understand where user interactions drop off.\n\nSneak #3: For the 'data storytellers', Project Slide Wow makes presenting data much more succinct by automatically generating slides from datasets.\n\nSneak #4: Been put off moving content management systems because of the sheer amount of work and time involved? This next sneak uses an AI agent to handle that for you in a much more efficient manner.\n\nThat's us over and out for this evening. Just a reminder that the projects demonstrated this evening in Sneaks are in development in the labs, so may or may not make it to general availability.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other best stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on President Trump\u2019s latest set of tariffs. This time around, Trump targeted champagne in a bid to get European countries to reduce their restrictions on American whiskey brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s. Cramer started out by explaining the effect of the tariffs on the consumer and the general trend in the alcoholic beverage market:\n\n\u201cIt depends on what do you really want to do if you\u2019re the President and these, and expensive wine. And expensive champagne. Or make them expensive. Well I mean you basically want them to say will you stop it with the Jack Daniel\u2019s? I mean, come on. Come on. If you try to make Jack Daniel\u2019s expensive, everything you sell us is just gonna be too expensive and we\u2019re all gonna be drinking Kim Crawford. . .But I do think that this is a very, very high tariff and I think it would cause a lot of attention in France.\u201d\n\nCramer\u2019s show, which aired on Thursday, came after Monday\u2019s massive stock market bloodbath which saw the flagship S&P index shed $4 trillion in value from its post-election peak. The move, coupled with market worries about a recessionary impact from tariffs, led several analysts to cut their targets for the index. Commenting on the cuts, Cramer outlined:\n\n\u201cYeah and I thought that was a great. . .look we kind of thought the President was transactional. Now we\u2019ve realized the President is in transit. Now I am less concerned about the President than I was before because when I look at the different, I\u2019ve been trying to get them to clarify what they\u2019re doing. But other than autos, you know look we\u2019re gonna have us a period where we\u2019re gonna go from two-and-a-half percent autos to 25% and that\u2019s gonna hurt Japan, it\u2019s gonna hurt Germany. It\u2019s gonna hurt Korea. And that\u2019s the real tariff. And when we do that, that\u2019s the day that the market\u2019s gonna go down big enough to buy. Because then they\u2019re kind of done. Remember, well here\u2019s the problem Carl, nobody buys anything that we make so it\u2019s really hard. . .President\u2019s not explained that well. At all. That there\u2019s like, they don\u2019t buy any of our stuff. So what are they gonna do? Like put, even higher tariff on Kentucky Gentleman?\u201d\n\nCramer\u2019s recent programs have also focused on the impact of the President\u2019s tariffs on the car industry. He has urged caution when considering buying American car stocks, and this time around, he discussed the impact of higher car prices due to the tariffs on the broader economy:",

            "content": "The Sneaks stage at Adobe Summit '25 featuring celebrity guest co-host Ken Jeong. Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nEvery year during Adobe Summit, the company gives the public a sneak peek into its latest experimental innovations, with 40% of them historically making it to actual rollout. In the past, some of Adobe's most popular features were first revealed as part of Sneaks, including Generative Fill, then dubbed Project Fast Fill.\n\nAlso: Adobe reveals 10 purpose-built AI agents -- here's what they can do for your business\n\nThe Sneaks are proposed by Adobe employees and build on Adobe's existing offerings to optimize creatives' workflows. Unsurprisingly, this year, most of the Sneaks finalists involved AI agents that can help marketers and brands alike. To get a glimpse into Adobe's future, keep reading below.\n\nProject Perfect Context\n\nThis experiment would help teams better understand their customers through an AI agent that can combine external insights, such as economic data and global weather, with first-party behavioral data within the Adobe Customer Journey Analytics in the Adobe Experience Platform, according to the post.\n\nAlso: AI tools are increasingly driving traffic to retail sites, Adobe Analytics finds\n\nUsing the AI agent, users can learn more about customer experiences by conversationally asking questions that leverage more information about both datasets. These insights can ultimately inform the building of future experiences to cater more to the audience's wants and needs, ultimately improving campaign performance.\n\nProject Slide Wow\n\nSlide decks are a great medium for presenting information, but building them can be time-consuming. Senior leaders, in particular, often bear the burden of synthesizing robust data insights into presentations to share the findings with other teams. Project Slide Wow automates the entire process, converting data in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics into an engaging visual Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that includes visualizations and even speaker notes.\n\nAlso: Forget Sora: Adobe launches 'commercially safe' AI video generator. How to try it\n\nThe presenter can then ask a question and get an answer pulled straight from the dataset, even if it wasn't originally included in the slides. In the live demo at Sneaks, the presenter converted a dataset of favorite ice cream flavors into a visually engaging and well-organized PowerPoint presentation with different sections, charts, speaker notes, and even a concluding slide with questions. It kept a theme and natural order that drove the point.\n\nSabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nProject Site Leap\n\nContent management systems play a central role in many businesses' core operations. Yet even when these systems are outdated or no longer the best fit, companies often struggle to make a change due to the high costs and potential disruption to their workflow. As the name implies, Project Site Leap makes the transition easier using an AI agent that can take existing brand pages, import the content into Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), and align it with new design mocks, according to Adobe.\n\nAlso: Adobe Acrobat's AI Assistant can now decipher complex contracts for you\n\nIn the demo, the presenter switched an open-source blog into AEM by asking Project Site Leap to \"Onboard the site to AEM,\" and was able to import all of the content into AEM within seconds. Then, the second step was to reproduce the design of the blog into AEM, and again, it was able to do it within a second. Lastly, the presenter asked the AI agent to freshen up the images and the typography, and again it was able to do so. If you want to change the design entirely but keep the content, you can also upload a mock-up and have the agent transform the old content into the new style.\n\nProject Get Savvy\n\nThis experiment is the ultimate tool for marketers, helping them through their kickoff campaigns by aiding the brainstorming, creation, and deployment of a campaign through the use of various AI agents. With Project Get Savvy, marketers would be able to interact with agents in real time to create content and visuals, find the best ways to reach audiences, and even create personas that resemble the target audience and get their feedback.\n\nProject Frame Sense\n\nTaking a step away from agentic capabilities, the next couple of experiments focus on using generative AI to deliver value to marketers and their audiences. Project Frame Sense helps marketers create tailored experiences in the travel and hospitality sector, where creating tailored experiences is specifically worthwhile.\n\nAlso: Adobe Photoshop adds Live Co-editing for more productive team work\n\nThe experiments connect customer insights from the Adobe Experience Platform with video content so that customers can receive a highly personalized video tailored to their preferences. The videos even use AI-powered digital avatars. As seen in the image below, in the demo, the presenter took an AI avatar of Sneaks host Eric Matisoff, Principal Evangelist of Analytics & Data Science at Adobe, to create a personalized video for co-host Ken Jeong that took into account Ken's interests, such as what food he wanted to eat on the trip.\n\nSabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nProject Panorama\n\nProject Panorama helps brands make sense of user interactions on mobile applications. This task is typically challenging because of all the different elements found in apps, such as screens, offers, and messages. Instead, Project Panorama would offer a map that brands can use to visualize the user's journey.\n\nAlso: Adobe's new AI feature lets you edit stock images on the fly -- no Photoshop needed\n\nThe map would update in real time, track performance metrics and user behavior, and outline each page and screen of the experience, according to Adobe. Ultimately, marketers could use those insights to deploy new offers and send messages from the Project Panorama interface without additional code, making optimization to increase user engagement easier.\n\nProject Vision Cast\n\nThis project focuses on making the collaboration between marketers and creatives more seamless. Using generative AI, it combines data insights and brand imagery to create rough interpretations of new product concepts. These interpretations are then sent to Adobe's Project Concept so both teams can brainstorm and collaborate.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",

We just had to understand and define that in order to make AI more autonomous.\n\nCoca-Cola VP Rapha Abreu stressed the importance of a clearly defined AI strategy. His colleague and fellow VP Shekhar Gowda added the companies who see the highest levels of success are the ones that define AI's role carefully. \"When you are defining your AI strategy... the key is to establish a human lead approach, where designers, creatives, humans, in general, lead and AI follows,\" Abreu said.\n\nTwo more leaders from Coca-Cola are here to talk about how they use generative AI to fuel content production for the group's 200 brands in over 200 countries. They haven't touched their Coke Zeros yet, maybe they're just there for product placement?\n\n\"We're moving from experimentation to implementation,\" Ahuja said about agentic AI.\n\nAfter a short break, Amit Ahuja, SVP of Experience Cloud, Platform and Products, Digital Experience is joining us on stage to unpack everything AI from this morning.\n\nFamiliar challenges like cost and trust continue to slow down AI adoption, but IBM Consulting Global Chief Design Officer Billy Seabrook reckons change management is what's really stopping companies from realizing the benefits of AI. Preparing and re-training the workforce is the biggest thing companies can do right now not to get left behind.\n\nProbed about the effects of artificial intelligence on designers, Balakrishnan noted that Adobe's tools help creatives become more productive, adding that the company doesn't view any of its products as replacements for humans. AI also has the power to \"dramatically lower the barrier to entry,\" he stated. Tapia added that creatives would rather spend more time on ideation, creation and inspiration. GenAI tools can help increase the velocity of content while creating a \"productivity dividend\" that the creators can take to be more strategic.\n\n\"The demand for content is insatiable,\" reads a slide presented by Adobe Express Director Pierre Tapia and SVP and GM Govind Balakrishnan to a small group of the press, citing research revealing that 90% of marketing leaders believe the demand for content will increase 2x in the next two years (50% by 3x). The company's new AI tools can help companies repurpose existing assets leading to quicker time to market and a reduction in net new assets (and therefore cost).\n\nWell that's a wrap on the opening keynote, which covered a lot of ground very quickly. To recap, we heard about updates to Firefly Services including new APIs and custom models for creating high-quality, on-brand assets and the newly launched Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator and Brand Concierge app for building and managing Adobe and third-party AI agents. Agentic AI is very much the theme of Adobe Summit 2025.\n\nAdobe lifted the wraps off three new Firefly Services APIs in general availabliity: Translate and Lip Sync API for instant translation of spoken dialog into different languages, Reframe API to resize videos for different platforms and Custom Models API to ensure newly created assets are on-brand. Additionally, the Substance 3D API will enable teams to bring together 3D objects with Firefly-generated backgrounds to accelerate content production, but this one's in beta.\n\nResponding to customer demand, Adobe is adding new video editing tools to Firefly services, including aspect ratio changes and language translation \u2013 set to be one of the most impactful changes creatives and marketers can benefit from with mammoth time-saving benefits.\n\nDigital Media Business President David Wadhwani echoed Balazs's comments: \"The best way to stand out is through personalization.\" He noted how speed to market is imperative, adding that the efficacy of social media campaigns typically drops off after just one week. GenAI can plug the gap where budget growth doesn't keep up with demand for more content.\n\nAdobe CMO Lara Balazs explained how marketing is harder than ever, but personalization at scale holds the key to success. \"If they don't get on board, they're going to be left behind,\" she added.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy has introduced Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator for Businesses, including 10 new purpose-built agents supercharge capacity and eliminate bottlenecks. Chakravarthy promised more agents will be coming soon before showing us how one of the 10 launch agents, the site optimization agent, can help keep a website operating at peak performance by finding opportunities to enhance the site and then executing those autonomously.\n\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey share a Coke Zero as Quincey explains how he modernized the beverage giant from within, beginning with favoring jeans over a suit and tackling the traditional hierarchical company structure. (Image credit: Future)\n\n\"Creativity is a uniquely human trait,\" Narayen explained as he stressed how AI will enhance human output before he welcomed Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience and Worldwide Field Operations, to tell us where Adobe's heading.\n\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen welcomes attendees to the company's 23rd Summit. \"Creativity is the new productivity,\" he said as he summarized the latest AI announcements. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWe've been escorted to the press area ready for the opening keynote session where we'll hear from Adobe executives and customers about the future of customer experience with an emphasis on creativity, marketing and AI. (Image credit: Future)\n\nJust as a reminder, the opening keynote will be hosted by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, CMO Lara Balazs and other execs. We'll also doubtlessly hear from customers and fans alike - should be a good one!\n\nGood morning \u2013 we're up bright and early for today's action-packed itinerary. We'll be off to the keynote in a couple of hours before heading off into different breakouts and press briefings to hear what's new from Adobe.\n\nWe've collected our badge ready for an action-packed day tomorrow, which kicks off with an Opening Keynote headed up by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, CMO Lara Balazs and other execs.

Learn More\n\nAdobe first made its mark in generative AI with its Firefly image generation model in 2023 and its generative fill feature on Photoshop.\n\nWith enterprise customers turning their attention from exploring AI-powered creation tools to agents, Adobe is throwing its hat in the agentic ring and adding more personalization features to everyday customer experience tasks.\n\nAdobe announced the launch of 10 agents and an orchestration tool on its Adobe Experience platform. These tools target specific needs such as customer channel engagement, content production, data management and site optimization.\n\nThe company also debuted Brand Concierge, a way for organizations to personalize their websites for customers based on their previous interactions with the brand.\n\nLoni Stark, vice president of strategy and product for Adobe, told VentureBeat in an interview that agents would change the customer experience for both the enterprise and their clients.\n\n\u201cWe see that agents can scale up the capacity of experience makers. It\u2019s not just because of the hype out there, but because when we have delivered our tools to the customers we work with, we see that as their trust in the AI capabilities we deliver increases, they start to think, oh, can I make them autonomous,\u201d Stark said.\n\nShe added the idea is to let these agents work ambiently, meaning the agents and the orchestrator continue to work in the background to provide information or solve issues for enterprises proactively.\n\nOrchestration and agents for customer experience\n\nThe new agents launching on AEP are:\n\nAccount qualification agent to evaluate new sales pipelines\n\nAudience agent, which analyzes cross-channel engagement data to\n\nContent production agent that helps marketers and creatives scale by generating and assembling content\n\nData insights agent simplifies and expands the process of deriving insights from signals\n\nData engineering agent\n\nExperimentation agent helps stimulate new ideas and conduct impact analysis\n\nJourneyagentst can orchestrate cross-channel experiences\n\nProduct advisor agent recommends experience and product engagement experiments\n\nSite optimization agent manages and detects traffic and engagement in a website\n\nWorkflow optimization agent for cross-team collaboration and monitoring ongoing projects\n\nStark highlighted the Site Optimization agent during a demo with VentureBeat. The agent would check for broken links or proactively examine a brand\u2019s website for traffic and bounce rates and suggest fixes.\n\n\u201cMost companies don\u2019t have people that spend all of their days looking at broken links, for example, especially if they have tens of thousands of pages, or can\u2019t check on these daily,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that there\u2019s lost opportunity both if you think about the bounce rate. This agent is pre-trained, so out of the box, it already comes with skills like looking for broken backlinks.\u201d\n\nStark said enterprises using the Experience Platform can fine-tune how much agents access their data through the orchestrator.\n\nAdobe joins companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow in providing users with pre-built agents for specific tasks and teams.\n\nA customized brand website\n\nAnother new feature for the Adobe Experience Platform is Brand Concierge, which will help enterprises build websites that offer customized customer visits. Organizations can create a website for their company or product that greets customers by name and provides a query box asking them what information they want.\n\nSay a company has a website for a hotel chain. A customer can ask the chat function or click on premade prompts to ask about amenities specific to one location, Brand Concierge helps the company push the appropriate information to the front page of the site and also customize all other assets and experiences to that location. Stark said customers can still browse the site as usual, but Brand Concierge pushes customer engagement further by remembering how particular customers have interacted with the enterprise before.\n\nBrand Concierge is a separate offering from the agents that sits on top of the AEP, but Stark said, \u201cIt\u2019ll leverage agents such as the Product Advisor Agent, which is already built into the Concierge app.\u201d The company also understands its customers\u2019 past interactions and preferences.\n\nStark said Adobe customers increasingly find their clients more comfortable using AI chatbots, making it easier to transition them to more personalized, prompt-based website experiences.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is that consumers are increasingly comfortable with an AI-powered conversational experience. New Adobe Analytics data shows a 1,200% surge in U.S. retail sites and a 1,700% surge in U.S. travel sites (July 2024 to Feb 2025) from generative AI sources. Companies can surface this on high-traffic properties (like their website) with an increasingly familiar form factor that is gaining traction,\u201d Stark said.\n\nThe company launched the Adobe Experience Platform in 2019, but the real-time customer experience management solution saw a massive update last year, including an AI assistant for users.",

Even off the casino floor, the place is buzzing with energy.\n\nThis is not just a time for those in the digital experience industry to network. We\u2019re all here to learn everything we can about today\u2019s top trends, must-have knowledge and, of course, AI\n\nThe day starts with the morning Keynote, where Adobe makes some of its biggest announcements of the year.\n\nCustomer Experience Management Is Dead\n\nCustomer experience management (CXM) is out, according to Adobe. Taking its place is AI-enabled customer experience orchestration (CXO).\n\nExperiences are changing, becoming more dynamic. As such, planning and delivering these experiences is changing too, with increasing orchestration required. \u201cTo achieve this true one-to-one personalization at scale requires a perfect blend of creativity, marketing and AI,\u201d Anil Chakravarthy, president of digital experience business at Adobe, said at the event.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy, president of digital experience business at Adobe, speaking at the 2025 Adobe Summit\n\nOne way to do this? AI agents. These autonomous bots can work independently and alongside humans, integrating organizational goals, creating plans and taking action on their own.\n\nThis year, Adobe\u2019s big announcement focuses on solutions that will help brands find success in this new customer experience landscape.\n\nAdobe Bets Big on Agent Orchestrator\n\nThe big debut this year at Adobe Summit? Agent Orchestrator, a new feature anchored within the Adobe Experience Platform. Agent Orchestrator will let businesses build, manage and orchestrate AI agents that can engage directly with customers and support employees in their daily workflows.\n\nAdobe's Agent Orchestrator\n\nEach year, according to Adobe, more than one trillion experiences are activated via Adobe Experience Manager. Agent Orchestrator will kick AEM\u2019s capabilities up a notch, using AI built with businesses in mind. The tool offers deep, semantic understanding of enterprise data, content and customer journeys.\n\nThis new tool is built atop a CXO-oriented knowledge base, allowing it to capture the interaction between data, content and workflows and design targeted and immersive experiences. The AI agents are also constructed on decision science and language models that display adaptive reasoning, meaning they can think logically, reflect, explain and justify concepts and operations.\n\nNot only is Adobe\u2019s agentic AI targeted specifically toward the enterprise, it also offers some built-in features businesses need \u2014 like data governance and regulatory compliance.\n\nMultiple Agents, Multiple Platforms\n\nYou\u2019re not limited to the use of one AI agent at a time. According to Chakravarthy, organizations can coordinate across multiple agents \u2014 not just those in Adobe's platforms, but also ones already in use within your workflows.\n\n\u201cThe interoperability between the AI agents in different ecosystems will become critical,\u201d noted Chakravarthy, adding that they're working with a multitude of partners to make this interoperability possible. Adobe announced new and continued partnerships with Accenture, Acxion, Amazon Web Services, Deloitte Digital, EY, Genesys, IBM, Microsoft, RainFocus, SAP and Workday.\n\nRelated Article: Will Agentic AI Mean the End of SaaS?\n\nOrchestrator Offers 10 Out-of-the-Box Agents\n\nMany brands understand the need to integrate AI into their operations \u2014 but a lot don\u2019t know where to start. With Agent Orchestrator, you don\u2019t have to build custom AI agents right out of the gate.\n\nThe tool has 10 purpose-built agents users can take advantage of out of the box, with \"others coming soon,\" said Chakravarthy. These agents can optimize websites, refine target audiences, generate content, help break down data siloes, drive personalization at scale and much more.\n\nAdobe's Site Optimization Agent\n\nThe 10 out-of-the-box agents include:\n\nAccount Qualification Agent: Evaluates and advances new opportunities within the sales pipeline and engages those in buying groups responsible for major purchasing decisions.\n\nEvaluates and advances new opportunities within the sales pipeline and engages those in buying groups responsible for major purchasing decisions.

And they\u2019re using generative AI to facilitate that.\n\nAccording to Adobe Insights, US retail sites saw a 1,300% surge in traffic from generative AI sources between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 in 2024, compared to the year prior. And this trend has continued into 2025, with traffic from genAI sources increasing by 1,200% in February of this year compared to July 2024.\n\nWith customers increasingly wanting to interact with brands in new and personalized ways, businesses need more than chatbots limited to pre-set FAQs. Adobe plans to fill this need with its new Brand Concierge, an AI agent built on AEP Agent Orchestrator that can handle complex tasks, generate product comparisons and offer tailored customer recommendations \u2014 \u201call anchored in first party-data to ensure reliability and compliance,\u201c noted Chakravarthy.\n\nAdobe's Brand Concierge\n\nThe concept behind Brand Concierge is a tool that can assist customers from exploration all the way to purchase decisions. As customers interact with the site, the tool captures insights on sentiment, behavior and pain points to further tailor the overall experience.\n\nBrand Concierge can pull upon a company\u2019s unique brand attributes, customer data and third-party sources, meaning it can create experiences that are different for each person landing on the site. It\u2019s also multimodal, able to support interactions across text, voice and images.\n\nWhile this new tool can handle B2C use cases, it\u2019s also built with B2B teams in mind. It has the ability to connect with other AI agents \u2014 such as Account Qualification Agent \u2014 to handle unique needs and sync with sales and marketing teams.\n\nBrand Concierge can deliver personalized content based on an existing account relationship, meaning it can offer up information that that B2B customer values most. It can also book-follow up meetings. By taking over certain tasks, Brand Concierge can help organizations generate more leads and boost conversion through ultra-precise personalization.\n\nRelated Article: Inside the Privacy-First Approach to the Personalized Customer Experience\n\nNew Enterprise Capabilities & Integrations for Adobe Express\n\nIt should come as no surprise that brands are creating \u2014 and people are consuming \u2014 more content than ever before. Yet, said Lara Balazs, CMO at Adobe, \"We struggle to keep pace with the quality and volume of content that\u2019s required to build today\u2019s channels.\"\n\nAdobe CMO Lara Balazs speaks at the 2025 Adobe Summit\n\nA new survey from Adobe found that 89% of enterprises believe content demand will at least double this year \u2014 and half of enterprises believe demand will increase three-fold.\n\nAnd beyond volume, consumers also expect content to be tailored specifically to them. \u201cPersonalization at scale is a mandate,\" Balazs said. \"Marketers know this. If they don\u2019t get on board, they\u2019re going to be left behind.\u201d\n\nThis fast growing need means companies turning to outside tools where brands have no governance or compliance controls, leading to potential legal, ethical and reputational risks. To help organizations meet this content demand and mitigate risks, Adobe has announced new enterprise features and integrations for its Adobe Express platform.\n\nThe new capabilities, which will be available this summer, include:\n\nAdobe Workfront Integration: Offers unified review and approval workflows between creative and marketing teams to drive content and productivity at scale. Interoperability with other Creative Cloud apps \u2014 including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Lightroom \u2014 will also be available. Beyond the workplace, customers can use this integration to access and edit assets.\n\nOffers unified review and approval workflows between creative and marketing teams to drive content and productivity at scale.

One-Click Brand Set-Up: Automatically extracts and organizes brand logo, colors and fonts based on uploaded assets and branded files. Customers can also add branded assets and templates to share directly with teams.\n\nMany global organizations, claims Adobe, including Sentsu, PGA Tour and Rakuten, already use Adobe Express to create enterprise content easily and at scale.\n\nSakura Martin, global head of brand and design at Dentsu, said the tool fills a \u201ccritical gap\u201d for the company\u2019s distributed marketing teams, allowing them to activate content and assets 70% faster while freeing up 20% more time for creative teams to focus on strategic work.\n\nIf marketers adopt AI technology, explained Balazs, they will see cost savings, and they will sacle further than they ever thought possible.\n\nMore Announcements at Adobe Summit\n\nAgent Orchestrator is the big headline of the day. But Adobe had a few other announcements to unveil at this morning\u2019s keynote, including:\n\nAdobe Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator\n\nBuilt on the Adobe Experience Platform, this tool can help teams identify and act on high-impact opportunities, pinpointing strategies that will improve the omnichannel experience \u2014 something many brands still struggle with.\n\nPartnered with Adobe\u2019s Experimentation Agent, the Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator can automatically detect trends, learnings and best practices from previous and active experiments.\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Sites Optimizer\n\nPart of AEM, Sites Optimizer is a new solution that automates issue diagnosis and solution recommendations with the goal of improving web traffic acquisition and engagement.\n\nPaired with Adobe\u2019s Site Optimization Agent, the tool can anticipate, detect and recommend high-impact opportunities in real time. Plus, marketers can implement recommendations right within the platform.\n\nAdobe GenStudio Foundation\n\nGenStudio Foundation offers marketers and creatives a single source for data across all of Adobe\u2019s suite of supply chain solutions. It provides visibility into campaign plans, projects, assets and insights without the need for users to navigate between platforms and pages.\n\nGenStudio for Performance Marketing Update\n\nGenStudio for Performance Marketing is a self-service tool that allows marketers and creatives to scale the production of on-brand paid social ads, display ads, marketing emails and more with generative AI.\n\nNow, says Adobe, asset creation for display ads is available for ads served through Microsoft Advertising Platform and Google Campaign Manager 360. Adobe also expanded on its collaboration with LinkedIn Ads, allowing teams to create campaign assets for B2B use cases.\n\nAdobe\u2019s extensibility framework will allow marketers to connect with various third-party solutions as well, extending functionality in related industries like healthcare and finance. Integratable third-party tools include those from Acxiom, IntelligenceBank, Lithero, PwC, Saifr and Stensul.\n\nRelated Article: AI in Marketing in 2025: Smart Automation and Brave Brand Building\n\nStill More to Come at Adobe Summit\n\nIt\u2019s only day one of Adobe Summit, and the day is not over yet.

The announcement was timed to the Adobe Summit conference in Las Vegas.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPublicis Groupe continues its streak of potentially transformative news, expanding a decade-plus relationship with Adobe to further advance its generative AI ambitions. The agency holding company last year announced plans to invest 300 million euros (about $325 million) over three years into the technology, which underpins its in-house CoreAI platform.\n\n\u201cThe combination of CoreAI and Adobe Firefly takes us even further in our mission to shape the future of personalized, data- driven content at scale. Together, we are setting a new standard for how brands engage with their audiences, driving both creativity and measurable business outcomes,\u201d Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun said in a statement.\n\nPublicis\u2019 agencies and production studios will use commercially safe models for image, vector and video creation, boosting speed and giving clients more creative control over the process. Beyond the integration of CoreAI and Adobe Firefly Services, the deal allows the generative AI tools to be leveraged alongside Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform for joint clients of both companies.\n\nPublicis has made several moves as part of its pledge around generative AI. Most notably, the company earlier this month acquired identity solutions firm Lotame to boost its data-driven marketing offering Epsilon \u2014 giving the company\u2019s generative AI even more data on which to train. Previously, its digital consulting agency Publicis Sapient expanded its partnership with Google Cloud and created a dedicated business unit to help clients plan, deploy and manage the technology.\n\nAdobe continues to partner with agencies and brands to deploy its generative AI technology. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies last week announced plans to integrate Adobe Firefly Services into its existing Adobe Creative Cloud workflows to increase efficiency and accelerate campaign execution. Previous deals have seen Adobe tie-up with WPP, IPG, Dentsu and Accenture around generative AI.\n\nPublicis\u2019 streak of wins includes recently winning the North American media and data business of The Coca-Cola Company \u2014 an early mover in the generative AI space \u2013 from competitor WPP. The group saw 6.3% organic growth in Q4 2024 and 5.8% organic growth in the full year.",

They\u2019re becoming a helpful assistant for compiling research before making a purchase, as well as helping with travel planning and financial guidance. Adobe issued its first report today profiling the trend, which shows a significant surge to U.S. websites from generative AI sources.\n\nThe Adobe Analytics insights are based on direct transactions online, showing the impact of generative AI on the digital economy. The retail insights, for instance, are based on analysis of more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, a greater volume of data than is available to any other technology company or research organization. A companion survey of more than 5,000 U.S. respondents provides an additional layer of context on how consumers are thinking about AI in their daily lives.\n\nGenerative AI embraced as a shopping assistant\n\nDuring the holiday shopping season, Adobe observed the first material surge in generative AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link). Between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, 2024, traffic from generative AI sources increased by 1,300 percent compared to the year prior (generative AI traffic was up 1,950 percent YoY on Cyber Monday). The trend has persisted beyond the holiday season. In February 2025, traffic from generative AI sources increased by 1,200 percent compared to July 2024. This shows the shift in consumer behaviors over a seven-month period. And while generative AI traffic remains modest compared to other channels, such as paid search or email, its growth has been notable \u2014 doubling every two months since September 2024.\n\nIn Adobe\u2019s survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, 39 percent have used generative AI for online shopping, with 53 percent planning to do so this year. The shopping tasks consumers are using generative AI for include conducting research (per 55 percent of respondents), receiving product recommendations (47 percent), seeking deals (43 percent), getting present ideas (35 percent), finding unique products (35 percent) and creating shopping lists (33 percent).\n\nNew Adobe Analytics data also profiles what happens once generative AI users land on a retail website. Compared to consumers coming from non-AI traffic sources (including paid search, affiliates & partners, email, organic search, and social media), consumers coming from generative AI sources show 8 percent higher engagement as they linger on the site for a longer period of time. These visitors also browse 12 percent more pages per visit, with a 23 percent lower bounce rate. This speaks to the value of conversational interfaces in online shopping, which seem to help consumers be more informed and confident in their purchases.\n\nOnline shoppers say they see benefits in using an AI-powered chat interface, as it shortens the time required for them to receive information that is personalized to their needs. In Adobe\u2019s survey, we found that of those who have used AI for shopping, 92 percent said it enhanced their experience, with 87 percent saying that they are more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases. This is reshaping how businesses think about customer engagement, especially with the arrival of AI agents that will be able to handle more complex tasks and make highly tailored recommendations.\n\nAdditional Adobe Analytics Insights:\n\nPropensity to purchase: When it comes to conversion \u2014 visits that become purchases \u2014 traffic from generative AI sources is 9 percent less likely to convert compared to other sources of traffic. However, this has improved significantly from July 2024, when the same number was 43 percent. The conversion gap reinforces that AI is being utilized during the research and consideration stage, in advance of when shoppers are ready to hit the buy button. But the narrowing gap shows that consumers are also increasingly comfortable completing a transaction directly after an AI-powered chat experience.\n\nPreferred screen: Traffic from generative AI sources is predominantly coming through desktop devices, at 86 percent share compared to mobile (data from Nov. 2024 through Feb. 2025), with consumers seemingly finding it easier to have a back-and-forth conversation on a laptop or desktop computer. This is in stark contrast to overall e-commerce activity, where desktop share-of-visits came in at just 34 percent during the same time period.\n\nCategory nuances: Across e-commerce categories tracked by Adobe, conversion rates from generative AI traffic are highest in electronics and jewelry \u2014 and lowest in the apparel, home goods and grocery category. This indicates that for products such as televisions, consumers are leaning on AI to narrow options based on individual preferences (screen size, resolution, price), which creates a higher likelihood of direct purchase.\n\nGenerative AI adoption across other industries\n\nTravel: The use of AI for planning trips has seen a notable uptick: In February 2025, traffic to U.S. travel, leisure and hospitality sites (including hotels) from generative AI sources increased by 1,700 percent compared to July 2024. In Adobe\u2019s survey, 29 percent of the consumers surveyed have used generative AI for travel-related tasks, with 84 percent of those individuals saying it improved their experience. The top use cases among AI users include general research (per 54 percent of respondents), travel inspiration (43 percent), local food recommendations (43 percent), transportation planning (41 percent), itinerary creation (37 percent), budget management (31 percent) and packing assistance (20 percent). Once users land on a travel site, Adobe Analytics data shows a 45 percent lower bounce rate among consumers coming from a generative AI source \u2014 showing a consumer who is more informed and engaged.",

However, this doesn\u2019t mean ChatGPT research typically ends with a purchase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, while traffic from the latest evolution of chatbots \u201cshow 8 percent higher engagement,\u201d such visitors are also \u201c9 percent less likely to convert compared to other sources of traffic\u201d as of Feb. 2025, Adobe said, citing its analysis of \u201c1 trillion\u201d U.S. retail site visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Generative AI today seems more like a tool for window shoppers than a boon for retailers, but this dynamic could flip. According to Adobe, that 9% figure \u201chas improved significantly from July 2024, when the same number was 43 percent.\u201d The software giant elaborated: \u201cThe conversion gap reinforces that AI is being utilized during the research and consideration stage, in advance of when shoppers are ready to hit the buy button.\u201d But, it added, the closing gap \u201cshows that consumers are also increasingly comfortable completing a transaction directly after an AI-powered chat experience.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen shoppers turn to AI tools, Adobe found they mostly do so for general research (55%), followed by product recommendations (47%), deal hunting (43%), gift ideas (35%), finding \u201cunique products\u201d (35%), and drafting lists (33%).\n\nAnother interesting wrinkle in the report is that website traffic linked to AI tools typically comes from desktops and laptops (86%), rather than smartphones. Adobe explains that this preference sharply contrasts the broader, longstanding trend in e-commerce, \u201cwhere desktop share-of-visits came in at just 34 percent during the same time period.\u201d",

            "content": "New data from Adobe shows that while generative AI has begun influencing the online shopping experience for many consumers, it is primarily being used for the discovery and research phase, rather than for final conversion.\n\nAccording to the data, traffic from generative AI sources increased by 1,200 percent in February, as stacked up against July of last year. Such an increase could be, in part, due to an increased number of brands and retailers integrating generative AI into their technology roadmaps, and, in part, due to increasing consumer comfortability with the technology.\n\nAdobe found that about four in 10 consumers said they have used generative AI for shopping, and that 53 percent of consumers plan to do so in 2025.\n\nSome use cases have garnered more steam than others. Fifty-five percent of respondents said they used a generative AI tool for researching products, and just under half of respondents have used it for receiving product recommendations.\n\nThe technology has also become a way to find deals for 43 percent of respondents and a way to seek out gift ideas for 35 percent of consumers.\n\nStill, the conversion rate\u2014calculated based on the number of site visits that result in a user purchasing something\u2014is still 9 percent lower among consumers using generative AI, as compared with other sources of traffic. That rate has come down 34 percentage points from July 2024, when generative AI traffic converted at a rate 43 percent lower than other sources of traffic. Adobe posits that decline means consumers have started to become more comfortable using chatbots as part of their transaction\u2014and that consumers still prefer to use chatbots for research and consideration.\n\nWhile conversions may be lower when generative AI technology is involved, consumer engagement rate is higher; Adobe\u2019s data found that those entering a company\u2019s site because of generative AI, their engagement is 8 percent higher than when they enter a site from non-AI traffic sources, like email, generic search, paid search or social media. Those that enter a site because of generative AI also view 12 percent more pages per site visit and have a 23 percent lower bounce rate than those coming to a site from a non-AI source.\n\nDespite its preliminary success among consumrers, generative AI hasn\u2019t been a hit in every subset of the retail industry. Adobe\u2019s research shows that conversion rates are highest on jewelry and electronics and lowest on apparel, home goods and grocery items.\n\nVivek Pandya, lead analyst for Adobe Digital Insights, said he anticipates that many companies will continue to refine their generative AI strategies to make the tools more enticing to online shoppers.\n\n\u201cOnline shoppers are seeing benefits in using an AI-powered chat interface, as it shortens the time it takes for them to receive information that is personalized to their needs. In Adobe\u2019s survey, we found that of those who have used AI for shopping, 92 percent said it enhanced their experience, with 87 percent saying they are more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases,\u201d Pandya said in a statement. \u201cThis is reshaping how businesses think about customer engagement, especially with the arrival of AI agents that will be able to handle more complex tasks and make highly tailored recommendations.\u201d",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other best software stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nThe software industry has firmly established itself as one of the most resilient and fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. As digital transformation continues to expand across various industries, businesses are increasingly relying on software solutions to enhance efficiency, support seamless growth, and foster innovation. The rising focus on automating workflows, improving customer experiences, and leveraging data-driven insights has sustained the high demand for software products.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Software Growth\n\nEric Compton, an equities strategist for Morningstar Research Services, underscored artificial intelligence and digital transformation as major drivers for growth in his Industry Outlook published on March 11. He projected consistent revenue and margin growth for the software sector, with total industry revenue anticipated to rise at an annual rate of 11% through 2029. Key factors supporting this growth include high customer retention due to switching costs, significant initial investments that translate into steady revenue streams, and sustained demand for digital transformation. Compton also identified AI adoption, increasing data requirements, and the shift to cloud-based solutions as central drivers for growth, while cautioning against potential challenges like higher interest rates, economic uncertainties, and regulatory issues.\n\nThe Morningstar strategist further emphasized that despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term demand for software remains strong, particularly in database software and customer experience applications, which are expected to grow at the fastest rate. Software companies gain an advantage from substantial upfront investments in R&D and customer acquisition, which lead to long-lasting, high-value client relationships. Compton also underlined the fact that most firms in the sector possess strong competitive advantages, or \u201cmoats,\u201d primarily due to switching costs and network effects. Once a company adopts a software solution, shifting to a competitor is complex, ensuring a stable revenue stream. Although IT spending has normalized following the pandemic, ongoing automation, AI-driven advancements, and customer-oriented software solutions are expected to fuel sustained growth in the sector.\n\nOpportunities in the Software Market\n\nRecent performance in the global software industry has been marked by volatility. Jason Hunter, JP Morgan\u2019s Head of Technical Strategy, shared insights in a January interview with CNBC, highlighting trends in the software and semiconductor sectors. He noted that while semiconductor stocks led market growth in 2024, the software sector gained momentum later in the year but underperformed in December. This pullback brought the valuation ratios of both large- and small-cap software stocks back to their breakout levels relative to semiconductors, offering a more favourable risk-reward scenario for software investments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies (ELC) has partnered with Adobe to refine the launch of its digital marketing campaigns through generative artificial intelligence (AI), per details shared with sister publication Marketing Dive.\n\nThe beauty marketer will integrate Adobe Firefly Services into its existing Adobe Creative Cloud workflows to increase efficiency and accelerate campaign execution.\n\nThe partnership speaks to ELC\u2019s new Beauty Reimagined initiative that seeks to make the company more consumer-centric through digital transformation.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs the parent of brands including Clinique, La Mer, MAC Cosmetics and its eponymous label, ELC produces reams of marketing targeted at consumers across about 150 global territories. That amount of work is set to increase. Nearly two-thirds of marketers believe the demand for content will quintuple between 2024 and 2026, per a survey conducted by Adobe.\n\nTo meet climbing production needs, ELC has turned to generative AI through partnerships with major tech companies including Google and Microsoft. ELC is leveraging AI with Microsoft to uncover insights and maximize the utility of its data while the collaboration with Google is around building scalable AI solutions and driving personalization at scale.\n\nThat latest partnership sees ELC integrate Adobe Firefly Services, a collection of creative and generative APIs, into its existing Adobe workflows for tools like Photoshop and InDesign. The goal is to help creative teams recapture time spent on repetitive tasks, such as versioning creative across different channels and formats, that can be better used on ideating and devising fresh campaign concepts.\n\n\u201cMaintaining mindshare on digital channels such as social media is important in the competitive beauty industry, but oftentimes the content requirements for each platform stresses our ability to deliver new campaigns,\u201d said Justin Edwards, vice president and global digital creative and brand image at MAC Cosmetics, the first ELC brand to experiment with Adobe Firefly, in a statement.\n\nIn addition to integrating Adobe Firefly, ELC is now leveraging Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service to better utilize its digital asset management (DAM) system, which houses assets like logos and images that are the foundation for digital content. The improved DAM also promises to shorten the time it takes to build and deliver digital campaign assets.\n\nThe partnership with Adobe speaks to ELC\u2019s new strategic vision, Beauty Reimagined, that seeks to burnish the company\u2019s consumer-centric bona fides. The plan includes accelerating speed-to-market through digital innovation and boosting consumer-facing investments to step up customer acquisition.\n\n\u201cAt The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, we need to keep pace with a changing environment where an increasingly large share of transactions is happening through digital channels such as mobile devices,\u201d said Yuri Ezhkov, vice president for the creative center of excellence at ELC, in a statement\n\nBeauty Reimagined comes as ELC works to reorganize and reorient itself for a changing beauty landscape. To that end, the company in February appointed Jane Hertzmark Hudis as executive vice president and chief brand officer and announced plans to fill a chief digital marketing officer position. ELC saw net sales decrease 6% to $4 billion in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025.",

I\u2019ve attended SXSW since 2012, and this was a year with all the bells ringing. The 2025 edition of the Conference and Festivals ran March 7 through 15.\n\nA Special Welcome\n\nDay one began with a welcome from SXSW President and Chief Programming Officer Hugh Forrest. In this role, he oversees content for the Conference, as well as the SXSW Music Festival, the SXSW Film Festival, the SXSW Comedy Festival and SXSW EDU.\n\nForrest first thanked the volunteers, the staffers, the community, and the attendees for their support, their passion and their creativity which keeps the festival moving and growing.\n\nForrest also reminded the overflow crowd that long-time supporter Mark Cuban would enter into the SXSW Hall of Fame this year, and recommended attendees check out sessions on the next big thing in science: quantum computing.\n\nArtists from TWOLINE STUDIOS created art concurrent with speeches\n\nThe Elephant\n\nForrest called his next subject \u201cThe elephant in the room.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cFor those of you who are not aware, after SXSW 2025 concludes, this building goes away. Yes, that is true. Beginning in April they will tear down this building.\u201d\n\nThe building he referred to is the Austin Convention Center, the command center and the event center for SXSW. He explained that it would be replaced with a \u201cbigger and better\u201d convention center, but that SXSW would be without it for three years or maybe longer.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a huge challenge for us,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut it also presents tremendous opportunities for SXSW to reinvent what we do.\u201d\n\nHugh Forrest leads the SXSW Conference and Festivals\n\nNot Adobe MAX\n\nI was instantly reminded of what happened to Adobe MAX, the annual convention for users of Photoshop and other Adobe software. For years, Adobe MAX had called the Los Angeles Convention Center home. When a massive remodeling of LA Convention Center began, MAX went into \u201cexile\u201d for two years. First it went to San Diego, then to Las Vegas.\n\nI realized that globe trotting would not work for SXSW because of how tightly its identity was tied to Austin and the Austin community.\n\nIdeas, Please\n\nForrest also said that moving was not an option. \u201cThis event has never been about a building,\u201d he explained, \u201cit has been about people, ideas, connections, and opportunities. So, while it will be difficult, I\u2019m confident we can pull this off. We are still doing lots of brainstorming. Email me if you have ideas.\u201d\n\nForrest concluded with a passionate request: \u201cPlease, please, please, reach out to me with ideas, brainstorms, constructive criticisms, less constructive criticism, and all kinds of ideas.\u201d\n\nForrest mentioned that he could be contacted by email or on LinkedIn.\n\nThe Future\n\nAfter this first day\u2019s surprising elephant, the thirty-second year of the film and TV festival moved on with ninety-six feature films, including multiple world, international, and North American premieres.\n\nNext year\u2019s SXSW will take place March 12 through 18.

The same is also seen in photography, a medium that has always been on par with other forms of high art. However, in more recent weeks, it seems that photography\u2019s battle is not yet over.\n\nWhile we all understand the significance of artificial intelligence in perfecting technology, it has, however, made the act of creation a challenge. For instance, the AI algorithm is useful in subject detection in cameras, with Sony a1 II recently launching a whole camera with an AI chip, which helps to improve the image quality while making it faster in low-lit conditions. Similarly, AI has been utilized in editing software, which has been helpful in smoothing out the grain in images or helping to apply changes to a bulk of photographs in one go.\n\nAdobe\u2019s denoise comparison. Credit: Screenshot\n\nWhile these are needed for some genres of photographers, what has also happened next is that generative AI is being used to create images of thin air for varied purposes. For instance, we have spoken about electoral campaigns and images of certain calamities that are being used to affect voters\u2019 opinions. At the same time, a whole new plethora of non-consensual explicit images are being created using the same generative AI. This includes deepfakes of celebrities or against some minorities.\n\nIf you compare the good vs negative outcome, the negative seems to outweigh the good. For starters, generative AI has posed ethical concerns, and companies such as Adobe have introduced tools that can rob the livelihood of photographers. This is going to hit those who are in stock or commercial photography spaces since AI can now create campaign images just by using a vector file of a product. However, while it may not directly affect other forms of photography, such as portraiture, weddings, events, or photojournalism, it is likely to increase competition. Not only will certain photographers migrate to other genres of photography or switch to video, but they will constantly have to compete with the AI slop. Individuals are highly influenced by social media, so if you see images of a certain trend, there is a chance your client would ask for more but at a lesser price.\n\nAn example of AI editing tool. Credit: Screenshot\n\nThat\u2019s not all. The subtle acceptance of AI in public spaces like museums and by publications such as on websites will only make it impossible to distinguish between AI and real images. This will make photography far less impressive than it was after the dawn of digital cameras. As we stated earlier, more and more galleries will think before inviting photographers to showcase their works since photography does not draw the same amount of income as painting or other forms of art do. This leaves the medium in a precarious situation.\n\nHowever, the only outcome of this is that photography has to adapt and rely on tools from platforms such as Content Authenticity Initiative. This adoption could mean being aware of what AI is capable of and then leaving it up to the individual whether they cave in and use the tool or stick to creating images authentically. Only time can tell how this will pan out, but our hopes are that the future is brighter than it seems today.",

This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump temporarily halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, the EU\u2019s defense and space commissioner, said the European Commission is considering an expansion of its satellite capacity to improve geospatial intelligence for security purposes.\n\nBarbed wire fence around the telecommunication tower equipped with radar antennas and the satellite connection centre at an unknown location at an undated time.

But that is not for us to decide.\u201d\n\nThe European Council logo displayed at the EU headquarters in Brussels on March 6, 2025.

Kubilius stated that Norway would be included in the initiative, adding that he \u201chopes\u201d the U.K. will participate as well.\n\nThe inclusion of T\u00fcrkiye remains uncertain, but Kubilius noted that Poland\u2019s Prime Minister Donald Tusk recently met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signaling ongoing discussions.\n\nUnder the new defense plan, EU nations could also purchase weapons from Ukraine, which Kubilius said would be half the cost of Western alternatives while simultaneously supporting Ukraine\u2019s economy.",

When users click on what appears to be a legitimate Microsoft URL, the OAuth implementation vulnerability redirects them to attacker-controlled sites.\n\nThis redirection can be triggered by modifying parameters such as \u2018response_type\u2019 or \u2018scope\u2019 in valid authorization flows.\n\nThese attacks are particularly dangerous because they can bypass standard email security protocols such as domain reputation assessments, DMARC enforcement, and anti-spoofing strategies.\n\nSince the phishing messages traverse through Microsoft\u2019s legitimate servers, they\u2019re significantly less likely to trigger security alerts.\n\nTo avoid detection, the malicious apps request minimal permissions with limited scopes like \u201cprofile,\u201d \u201cemail,\u201d and \u201copenid.\u201d\n\nHowever, Proofpoint\u2019s threat detection engine still classified them as malicious, protecting customers using their Account Takeover Protection service.\n\nRecommendation\n\nOrganizations with Microsoft 365 environments should implement phishing-resistant authentication methods like FIDO2 security keys and establish strict conditional access policies.\n\nSecurity experts recommend disabling legacy authentication protocols and implementing number matching for multi-factor authentication to prevent attackers from bypassing MFA.\n\nThese attacks primarily target high-value employees, including executives, account managers, and finance personnel, who typically have access to sensitive data.\n\nIf successful, attackers gain persistent and independent access to emails, files, contacts, and Microsoft Teams chats. \u201cThis is part of a growing trend where attackers exploit built-in trust mechanisms within cloud services,\u201d noted security researchers.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging Microsoft\u2019s legitimate email system, these phishing messages can bypass security controls while appearing entirely genuine to recipients.\u201d\n\nOrganizations should review Azure AD sign-in logs, implement risky sign-in alerts, and monitor for suspicious OAuth application consent requests.\n\nAdditionally, security teams should enforce phishing-resistant MFA and conduct regular security awareness training focused specifically on OAuth consent phishing tactics.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nThe researchers have published several indicators of compromise (IOCs), including:\n\nApp IDs:\n\n14b2864e-3cff-4d33-b5cd-7f14ca272ea4 ('Adobe Drive')\n\n85da47ec-2977-40ab-af03-f3d45aaab169 ('Adobe Drive X')\n\n355d1228-1537-4e90-80a6-dae111bb4d70 ('Adobe Acrobat')\n\n6628b5b8-55af-42b4-9797-5cd5c148313c ('DocuSign')\n\nReply and Redirection URLs include domains hosted on workers.dev, tigris.dev, and pages.dev platforms.",

            "content": "For businesses operating across the supply chain, including third-party logistics (3PLs), warehousing partners, and other important players, the ability to demonstrate a commitment to a safe, secure, and efficient operation is increasingly important. We are on the cusp of supply chain operators leveraging modern surveillance solutions to engage in better, more reliable business practices. As organizations have embraced edge computing, video analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications, many have found that today\u2019s surveillance solutions don\u2019t just improve security\u2014they can be used to support automated processes, collect business intelligence, and drive new operational efficiencies as well. In fact, many non-security-related functional groups within the organization are already discovering computer vision applications. For these organizations, video devices are no longer just an expenditure, but an investment in the health and success of the overall business.\n\nModern surveillance solutions bolster security capabilities\n\nIt's important to remember that modern cameras can hardly even be called cameras\u2014they are, essentially, a full computer situated at the network edge. Today\u2019s powerful devices are effectively self-contained Linux servers, capable of running a wide range of analytics. Whether your organization relies on a cloud, on-premises, or hybrid deployment, this adds significant value. With the help of deep learning-enabled computer vision capabilities, these devices are becoming increasingly powerful, able to perform highly complex tasks. And since safety and security operations have long been the primary application for video surveillance solutions, it makes sense to start there.\n\nAs with any business function, it\u2019s important for organizations to be able to secure assets along their entire supply chain from theft, vandalism, and other criminal activity. Whether that means protecting warehouses from trespassers, shipping containers from burglars, or freights from would-be thieves or saboteurs, today\u2019s businesses have a wide range of surveillance devices at their disposal. What\u2019s more, the evolution of video technology and advancement of AI-based analytics mean those solutions are accurate and reliable than ever, which means businesses no longer need to rely solely on human beings to notice suspicious activity.\n\nThe advent of new, deep learning-enabled chipsets has allowed organizations to run advanced video analytics on the devices themselves, providing customers with additional flexibility and allowing them to deploy a cloud, on-premises, or hybrid model depending on their specific circumstances and needs. This has made analytics increasingly accessible to organizations of all sizes, putting new security solutions in the hands of businesses up and down the supply chain. For example, warehouse operators can leverage video analytics capabilities to create geofencing around their locations, automatically alerting security personnel if potential trespassers are detected. Today\u2019s solutions can even tell the difference between a human figure and a bear or a deer, limiting false alarms and ensuring that security teams can trust the technology they rely upon.\n\nModern analytics can also be trained to automatically recognize the logo on the side of a delivery vehicle and check it against delivery schedules. License plate recognition can ensure that only approved vehicles are granted entry through automatic gates, and other analytics can detect when a vehicle attempts to follow an approved vehicle through the gate, contact security or law enforcement if needed. Access control stations within the facilities themselves can ensure that only authorized personnel can enter secure or sensitive areas, using biometrics, QR codes, or even facial recognition to grant approval. Video devices can alert security if unauthorized entry is detected, or if suspicious persons are seen loitering near or blocking entry or exit areas. By automatically identifying and alerting on abnormal behavior, modern security systems are bolstering security capabilities across the board.\n\nLeveraging video data to enhance business operations\n\nWhile security is of high importance throughout the supply chain, modern video solutions have capabilities that go far beyond protecting physical locations. Today\u2019s analytics can provide business intelligence insights, improve operational efficiency, streamline logistics, and engage in countless other activities designed to improve the business\u2019s bottom line. While video surveillance has traditionally been considered a necessary expenditure, the ability to leverage them for business-related purposes has turned that on its head. Modern video devices no longer represent a cost center\u2014they represent an increasingly valuable investment in business operations.\n\nSome of the business-related capabilities are directly related to the devices\u2019 safety and security applications. If a device can be trained to automatically recognize approved vehicles and grant them entry to the premises, that can dramatically reduce the need for human involvement in the approval process, streamlining the entry and exit process and resulting in significant time savings. Regulatory and compliance also factor in here. Video analytics can be used to ensure exits are not accidentally blocked and employees are wearing hard hats or other personal protective equipment (PPE) in appropriate areas. Devices equipped with thermal imaging may even be able to detect chemical leaks or other potentially dangerous (and costly) incidents quickly. As a result, organizations can avoid costly fines, injured employees, and damage to merchandise and facilities.\n\nAI-based computer vision platforms are also being used to digitize yard and warehouse management operations by automatically indexing and analyzing trucks and trailers entering and exiting facilities. Most yards manually record license plate, DOT, and trailer numbers, and human operators confirm that trucks have appointments, check that they are hauling the correct trailers, and maintain an inventory of available vehicles. Unfortunately, this manual process is both inefficient and prone to error. Additionally, it can lead to choke points, increased labor costs, and poor resources utilization. By automating the process, computer vision platforms can significantly streamline entry and exit. Further analysis in the cloud or within on-premises servers can provide additional data-driven insights, identifying new patterns and correlations and leading to even greater efficiencies.\n\nMachine learning can also reduce common errors in data recording and integrate with operational databases and other management systems to provide full vehicle profiles beyond what cameras can see, resulting in better, more accurate information. This data can even be integrated with (for example) logistics applications to identify open loading or unloading bays and direct trucks to the appropriate stall in real time. That keeps traffic moving and avoids unnecessary confusion and delays that can negatively impact the business\u2019s bottom line. This same technology can monitor shipping containers, even going so far as to track individual containers as they arrive and depart. This data can even be correlated with video data to help administrators identify areas where efficiency could potentially be improved. Time is money for businesses, and every small increase to efficiency can create significant financial benefits.\n\nIntegrating video data throughout the organization\n\nIn many ways, businesses in the supply chain sector have an advantage over those in other industries: because security has long been a high priority for these organizations, most are already equipped with the modern surveillance devices they need to substantially improve their business operations. As computer vision capabilities become increasingly advanced and businesses leverage cloud computing, local servers, or a combination of the two, businesses up and down the supply chain will be able to take advantage of exciting new analytics designed to not only enhance the safety and security of their locations, but improve their bottom line as well. By incorporating the data gathered by video analytics with information from other areas of the business, these organizations are generating actionable insights that drive efficiency and streamline operations across the board.",

But analysts were quick to talk about the breakout number on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nShantanu Narayen, Adobe's CEO, said on the call that the company expects to double its AI ARR by the end of the financial year.\n\n\"Whether it is innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it,\" Narayen said on the call.\n\nThe company said it expects revenue to increase to between $5.77 billion and $5.82 billion in the second quarter.\n\nAdobe's stock dipped 4.5% in after-hours trading, extending a rough year that has seen shares slide 23%, even as the S&P 500 climbed 8%.\n\nAs AI spending surges, investors are watching closely to see if tech companies can turn big bets into real returns.\n\nNarayen said on the earnings call that future info on AI's ARR would be released \"periodically\" \u2014 not quarterly.\n\nIn a research note ahead of earnings, Gregg Moskowitz, a managing director at Mizuho, wrote, \"Adobe is unquestionably a frustrating stock in 2024.\"\n\nHe wrote that analysts remain optimistic that Adobe would successfully monetize its generative AI offerings and see strong growth in ARR and revenue guidance for the financial year.\n\nEquity analysts from Jefferies said in a report published on Sunday that chief information officers they surveyed expect their companies' spend on Adobe's creative software to accelerate in 2025.\n\nThe surveys included 15 chief information officers and 40 end users. The report said that Adobe's AI offerings are \"competitive\" and that \"fears of AI reducing the need for Adobe may be overblown.\"\n\nOf end users surveyed, 65% told Jefferies their use of Adobe's creative software would increase within the next three years, while 50% evaluated Adobe's AI offerings \"as better than competitors.\"\n\nAdobe did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside business hours.",

(Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nAdobe\u2019s second-quarter revenue forecast has met Wall Street expectations, but concerns over the company\u2019s ability to monetise its AI offerings have weighed on investor sentiment. The stock dropped more than 4% in extended trading as investors questioned whether Adobe\u2019s AI-driven products could generate substantial revenue growth amid rising competition from AI-focused startups.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (Q2 FY25), Adobe expects revenue between $5.77bn and $5.82bn, aligning with analyst forecasts compiled by LSEG. The US-based design software company also reaffirmed its full-year revenue target of $23.3bn to $23.55bn, reflecting confidence in its long-term strategy despite challenges in AI adoption. However, the outlook has not been enough to ease investor concerns regarding the scalability of AI monetisation.\n\n\u201cAdobe\u2019s success over the next decade will be driven by customer-focused innovation and new offerings for creators, marketing professionals, business professionals and consumers,\u201d said Adobe chair and CEO Shantanu Narayen. \u201cAdobe is well-positioned to capitalise on the acceleration of the creative economy driven by AI, and we are reaffirming our FY2025 financial targets.\u201d\n\nAdobe\u2019s quarterly performance and AI growth strategy\n\nAdobe\u2019s first-quarter results (Q1 FY25) showed strong revenue growth, with the company reporting total revenue of $5.71bn, a 10% year-over-year (YoY) increase, slightly ahead of the $5.66bn consensus estimate. Digital Media revenue, which includes its core Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, reached $4.23bn, surpassing projections of $4.19bn. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share stood at $5.08, exceeding expectations of $4.97.\n\nDigital Experience revenue totalled $1.41bn, driven by growth in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and its associated applications. Within this segment, subscription revenue reached $1.3bn, reflecting an 11% year-over-year increase. The company has introduced Real-Time CDP Collaboration, enabling advertisers and publishers to jointly analyse and activate audience data for personalised marketing campaigns. Clients including NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Major League Baseball have begun piloting the solution.\n\nDespite the strong financial performance, the primary concern remains Adobe\u2019s ability to scale AI monetisation. The company has made significant investments in AI-powered solutions, including Firefly generative AI models, which have been integrated into Photoshop, Illustrator, and Express. Firefly enables users to generate images, vectors, and now videos through AI-powered prompts. Adobe recently launched new Firefly subscription tiers, Firefly Standard, Firefly Pro, and Firefly Premium, as part of its strategy to drive AI-driven revenue.\n\nThe AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader is another key initiative, providing features such as document summarisation, intelligent search, and language translation. Adobe has also introduced GenStudio for Performance Marketing, which helps brands automate content creation and campaign management. The company claimed that more than 1,400 custom AI models have been developed since the launch of Firefly, with Deloitte Digital, IBM, and Mattel among those using the technology. GenStudio for Performance Marketing has also been adopted by firms including AT&T, Lenovo, Red Hat, Delta Airlines, Ford, and Microsoft as part of their content automation strategies.\n\nHowever, Adobe\u2019s AI monetisation figures remain modest. The company reported that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from AI-powered tools and add-on offerings was $125m at the end of the first quarter. Chief financial officer Dan Durn, during the earnings call, stated that Adobe expects to double this AI-driven ARR by the end of fiscal 2025.",

The $125 million AI book of business reflects only new offerings like Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant, and GenStudio, with expectations to double by year-end. Digital media ARR grew 12.6% YoY, with strong demand across business professionals, consumers, and creative pros. Acrobat\u2019s monthly active usage rose 23%, AI Assistant usage doubled QoQ, and Express saw increased SMB and student adoption (Shantanu Narayen \u2013 CEO, David Wadhwani \u2013 President, Digital Media).\n\nGrowth Segments & Sales Cycle, Macroeconomic Uncertainty & Adobe\u2019s Resilience (Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley, Kash Rangan \u2013 Goldman Sachs): Business professionals & consumers segment (15% YoY growth) is outpacing creative & marketing professionals due to a shorter sales cycle. Creative & marketing professionals\u2019 growth is expected to accelerate with new AI-driven subscriptions like Firefly and GenStudio. Adobe\u2019s diversified business model mitigates macroeconomic risks, including trade wars and tariffs. The company remains optimistic and well-positioned for sustained growth (Shantanu Narayen \u2013 CEO).\n\nRevenue Categorization Change & AI Book of Business Growth (Mark Moerdler \u2013 Bernstein Research, Alex Zukin \u2013 Wolfe Research): Adobe is shifting away from Document Cloud and Creative Cloud segmentation to reflect its evolving cross-cloud sales strategy, aligning with One Adobe\u2019s approach. This provides clearer insight into business momentum and market opportunities. AI Assistant and Firefly Services, with a longer market tenure, make up a significant portion of the $125M AI book of business, while GenStudio, launched later, is growing rapidly. AI revenue is expected to double in nine months (Daniel Durn \u2013 CFO, Shantanu Narayen \u2013 CEO, David Wadhwani \u2013 President, Digital Media).",

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a record first quarter. We achieved $5.71 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 11% year-over-year growth.\n\nGAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $4.14, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.08, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Our performance reflects the ongoing critical role that Adobe products play in powering the global digital economy. In addition, given Q1 performance, we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal '25 targets. Next week is Adobe Summit, our flagship Digital Experience Conference, where we will unveil the latest innovations across our portfolio.\n\nIn addition, we will host our annual investor meeting on March 18th, and we wanted to preview what we will share about our growth strategy. Adobe's success over the past decade has been driven by the exponential growth of the creative economy and the customer-focused innovations we've delivered across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our groundbreaking solutions are empowering an ever-expanding universe of users to imagine, create, and deliver standout content that drives exceptional experiences. Adobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever as digital continues to rapidly transform work life, education, and entertainment.\n\nAI represents a generational opportunity to reimagine our technology platforms to serve an increasingly large and diverse customer universe. With creativity at the core, we have been evolving our offerings and routes to market to anticipate the distinct needs of creative professionals and next-generation creators, marketing professionals, agencies and enterprises, and the broader set of consumers and business professionals. We believe this will drive continued growth and profitability. Creative professionals and creators need power and precision to bring their ideas to life across any media type.\n\nThe next generation of creators wants the flexibility of web and mobile tools in addition to the power of the desktop. They will benefit from the variety of AI models to ideate and explore creative possibilities. Adobe will serve this growing community with the most comprehensive set of web, mobile, and desktop applications delivered through various subscription tiers. In addition to Creative Cloud, we will offer new Firefly web app subscriptions that integrate and are an on-ramp for our web and mobile products.\n\nWhile Adobe's commercially safe Firefly models will be integral to this offering, we will support additional third-party models to be part of this creative process. The Firefly app will be the umbrella destination for new creative categories like ideation. We recently introduced and incorporated our new Firefly video model into this offering, adding to the already supported image, vector, and design models. In addition to monetizing stand-alone subscriptions for Firefly, we will introduce multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering.\n\nMarketing professionals need to create an unprecedented volume of compelling content and optimize it to deliver personalized digital experiences across channels, including mobile applications, email, social media, and advertising platforms. They're looking for agility and self-service, as well as integrated workflows with their creative teams and agencies. To achieve this, enterprises require custom, commercially safe models and agents tailored to address the inefficiencies of the content supply chain. With Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, Adobe is transforming how brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns, unlocking new levels of creativity, personalization, and efficiency.\n\nThe combination of the Adobe Experience platform and apps and Adobe GenStudio is the most comprehensive marketing platform to deliver on this vision. In addition to our direct sales force, we will leverage an ecosystem of partners and agencies to sell, implement, operate, and deliver business outcomes to companies of all sizes. We have accelerated One Adobe deals by increasingly integrating our creative and marketing products into a single enterprise solution. We will continue to invest in sales capacity to deliver Adobewide offerings across business, education, and government.\n\nBusiness professionals and consumers want ease of use across web and mobile through a freemium model. They're looking for quick and easy AI-first category-defining creative applications to help them stand out. While the need for creative expression continues to grow exponentially, the real value is in integrating creativity and productivity in an all-in-one solution. The combination of Express and Acrobat is Adobe's opportunity to make the journey from document creation to consumption smoother than ever.\n\nAI Assistant in Acrobat Reader and Express will accelerate the delivery of new conversational and agentic interfaces to add value to this combined offering. Revenue growth will be driven by distribution across web and mobile app stores, partnerships with major software providers, and focus on SMB and enterprise sales. Our generative AI innovation is infused across the breadth of our products, and its impact is influencing billions of ARR across acquisition, retention, and value expansion as customers benefit from these new capabilities. This strength is also reflected in our AI-first stand-alone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly App and Services, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, which have already contributed greater than $125 million book of business exiting Q1 fiscal '25.\n\nAnd we expect this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal '25. In summary, by leveraging the breadth of our products and technology platforms in the era of AI and delivering new tailored offerings and solutions by customer groups, we will drive the engine of growth for the next decade. We will win by focusing on business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals with a unified product strategy and go-to-market. We will start to provide financial visibility in these 2 new groups starting this quarter and expand on this at our Investor Day at Summit next week.\n\nI'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $4.23 billion, which grew 12% year over year. We exited the quarter with $17.63 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year over year.\n\nWe continue to see healthy performance in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Creative growth was driven by broad-based adoption across our routes to market and product portfolio with particular strength in new offerings like Firefly Services, an increasing number of One Adobe deals and a growing base of web and mobile users. Document Cloud continued to see strong organic demand, continued optimizations in free to paid conversion journeys and AI Assistant being released in additional languages. We drove strong performance across digital media in emerging markets.\n\nThe results represent a good start to the fiscal year. Creativity is going mainstream, and I want to provide more color on the audiences we serve. We live in a visual-first world where creative expression has become pervasive in every facet of life. Business professionals and consumers alike aim to produce visually rich, engaging content, whether it's a presentation, birthday invitation or social post.\n\nAt the same time, creative professionals, creators, and marketers are competing on the quality of their online presence and the personalized experiences they deliver to customers. They turn to Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud to achieve their content goals. Going forward, as a result of AI advancements, we see incredible opportunity to serve customers with audience-specific offerings. Business professionals and consumers are increasingly benefiting from deep integration between Acrobat, Express, and Firefly while creative professionals, creators, and marketers are investing in powerful workflows across Creative Cloud, our new web and mobile creative applications, Firefly and GenStudio.\n\nPDF continues to be the global standard for digital documents for business professionals, and Adobe Acrobat is revolutionizing the way people engage with them across mobile, web, and desktop. Features like AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader have been a game-hanger for everyone from sales teams to students looking for faster insights and smarter document editing. And the ability to share links and click comments has increased document productivity and helped drive additional adoption. These new capabilities and our cross-service investments have paid off with Acrobat and Reader monthly active usage growing 23% year over year.\n\nOur success with Acrobat has also shown us that whether for a sales presentation, a school project or a social media post, business professionals and consumers are looking for an easy-to-use solution that helps them create visually compelling content that stands out from the crowd of generic templates. In fact, a significant number of all documents created in Acrobat are visual documents, things like marketing content, sales pitches, presentations, infographics, and cover pages. We are making good progress in addressing this need by embedding Express capabilities as a native experience in Acrobat with the goal of boosting productivity and making the journey from document consumption to content creation smoother than ever. The integration of Adobe Express features in Acrobat allows users to create richer PDFs with AI-generated cover pages, embedded infographics, and customized images and empowers users to create fully formed animated videos and other rich digital output.\n\nWe see numerous early indicators of user demand as express usage through Acrobat has grown 10x year over year. Other highlights for business professionals and consumers include Acrobat AI Assistant support for languages now includes English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese. Acrobat AI Assistant support for legal workflows with contract-specific features. New AI capabilities in Express like clip maker for auto generation of video highlights and text rewrite to help produce more effective copy.\n\nExpanded Acrobat integrations with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Gmail, and Google Drive and strong adoption of link sharing for richer collaborative experiences have led to approximately 50% year-over-year growth in Acrobat web monthly active usage. Expanded Express integrations now include Miro, Box, Slack, Webflow, and HubSpot. The Express ecosystem also expanded to 225 plug-ins, more than doubling in the last year. Strong business and student adoption, Express onboarded nearly 6,000 new businesses in Q1, representing approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter growth.\n\nStudents with access to express premium grew 85% year over year. Key global customer wins include AT&T, Delta Airlines, Disney, Ernst and Young, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Paramount, and Qatar Airlines. Creative professionals and the next generation of creators who make their living by designing and producing content are focused on standing out and bringing their unique creative visions to life with pixel-perfect precision. As we mark the 35th anniversary of Photoshop, Adobe Creative applications remain the solutions of choice for the world's creative professionals across imaging, design, photography, video, illustration, and 3D.\n\nWe also see increasing demand from the next generation of creators who are looking for freemium web and mobile applications as they begin their creative journeys. To better serve these users, we launched a new Photoshop mobile app and an expanded web experience, delivering Photoshop's iconic image editing and design capabilities on the iPhone. The mobile app and all new web experience are also included in current Photoshop plans, offering established Photoshop customers a flexible ecosystem to create and edit across surfaces. The launch garnered over 30 million social engagements in just two weeks.\n\nThe release of the Adobe FireFly video model in February, a commercially safe generative AI video model, has been very positively received by brands and creative professionals who have already started using it to create production-ready content. Users can generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles to control shots, create distinct scenes with 3D sketches, craft atmospheric elements, and develop custom motion design elements. We're thrilled to see creative professionals and enterprises and agencies, including Dentsu, PepsiCo, and Stagwell finding success with the video model. Additionally, we recently launched an all-new Firefly application, the most comprehensive destination to generate images, vectors, and now videos with unmatched creative control and direct integration with our industry-leading creative apps to seamlessly move from ideation to production.\n\nIn addition to generating images, videos, and designs from text, the app lets you generate videos from keyframes, use 3D designs to precisely direct generations, and translate audio and video into multiple languages. We also launched two new plans as part of this release, Firefly Standard and Firefly Pro and began the rollout of our third plan, Firefly Premium yesterday. User engagement has been strong with over 90% of paid users generating videos. The launch of Photoshop on web and mobile and the release of the new Firefly application expands our growing family of web and mobile products, which now includes Photoshop for creative imaging, Lightroom for photography, Express for Design, and Firefly for ideation and early production.\n\nThese apps serve as value-added capabilities to our existing paid subscribers and as a frictionless freemium onboarding experience to attract and monetize next-generation creators. We're delighted with the early interest in these new offerings. Other creative professional and creator highlights include, continued strong adoption of GenAI in our products with Photoshop GenAI monthly active users at approximately 35% and Lightroom GenAI monthly active users at 30%. Users have generated over 20 billion assets with Firefly.\n\nThe introduction of new features in Premier Pro beta and After Effects beta are helping editors and motion designers stay ahead of deadlines with AI features like Media Intelligence, which helps users find footage faster using natural language and caption translation for 17 languages, which effortlessly expand video to global audiences. We're honored to see visionary filmmakers around the world telling the season's most acclaimed stories using Adobe Creative applications, including Academy Award winners, Anora and Dune: Part Two. The launch of Adaptive profiles and distraction removal in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera raw, which reduced tedious and repetitive tasks. Max Japan brought our community together and served as an opportunity for us to launch a number of new innovations, including performance improvements in Adobe Illustrator, which accelerate features like pan and zoom and loading large files up to 10x faster.\n\nWe had another great quarter in the enterprise with more customers turning to Firefly Services and custom models to scale on-brand content production for marketing use cases, including leading brands such as Deloitte Digital, IBM, IPG Health, Mattel, and Tapestry. Tapestry, for example, has implemented a new and highly productive digital twin workflow using custom models in Firefly. You'll hear more on how the combination of creativity and marketing is powering personalization at scale and enterprises. Adobe is incredibly well set up to take advantage of AI across creativity.\n\nWe're rapidly delivering tailored innovations to serve the full continuum of content creation for business professionals and consumers, creative professionals and creators, and marketing professionals. Our expanding breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both flagship and new offerings. We will be unveiling more exciting product capabilities at Adobe Summit and MAXLondon in April. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil S. Chakravarthy -- President, Digital Experience\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Experience Cloud had a strong Q1, achieving revenue of $1.41 billion for the quarter. Subscription revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth.\n\nOur leading solutions spanning content, data, and customer journeys enable enterprises around the world to deliver personalized experiences at scale, helping customers drive both top-line growth and productivity gains. In Q1, we delivered typical seasonal bookings and advanced our pipeline as enterprise customers initiated the execution of their critical 2025 priorities. Adobe Experience Platform and Apps play a pivotal role in enabling unified customer experiences. With the addition of AEP AI Assistant, we extended the value and impact of Experience platform by empowering more functions across the business with conversational interfaces for data ingestion, insight generation, audience segmentation, and experience delivery.\n\nWe're now building on these advances and expanding AEP to enable intelligent orchestration of customer experiences with AI agents natively built in. We're empowering customers to make better use of their first-party data and to drive more relevant ad experiences based on direct customer relationships. Our portfolio spans the entire content supply chain from creation and production, workflow and planning, asset management, delivery, and activation through to reporting and insights. Now we're bringing together creativity and marketing with AI to help our customers realize the full potential of personalization at scale.\n\nUp to now, marketing professionals have been constrained by the number of content variations they can create and the number of journeys they can deploy. With Adobe GenStudio, brands around the globe have been working with Adobe to bring creative and marketing teams closer together, simplify their creation to activation process, and unlock new levels of creativity, insights, and efficiency in marketing campaigns. Other highlights include, strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications with Q1 subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year on year; of real-time CDP collaboration, delivering a secure environment for advertisers and publishers to jointly discover, activate, and measure high-value audiences for more relevant campaigns. Built on AEP, real-time CDP collaboration is purpose-built for brands to connect and collaborate on first-party data.\n\nUsers can now measure ad effectiveness directly with publishers, including NBC Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery. Advertisers and agencies, including Alterra Mountain Company, WaveMaker, Major League Baseball, and the Coca-Cola Company piloted the solution to deliver personalized and performance ads. Launch of the AEM Cloud Service accelerator with Publicis Sapient, which can reduce the labor cost of migration up to 35%.\n\nIndustry analyst recognition in major analyst reports, including the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines. Strong demand for Firefly Services and custom models as part of the GenStudio solution with over 1,400 custom models since launch. GenStudio for performance marketing wins at leading brands, including AT&T, Lennar, Lenovo, Lumen, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Red Hat, Thai Airways, and Phoenix. Strong partnership momentum with GenStudio for Performance Marketing supporting ad creation and activation for Google, Meta, Microsoft Ads, Snap and several partners, including Accenture, EY, IPG, Merkel, and PwC offering vertical extension apps.\n\nPartnership with Dentsu to bring GenAI for playground to production for our joint customers with Adobe GenStudio Dentsu Plus. Key global customer wins, including Delta Airlines, Ford, IBM, Microsoft, PNC Financial Services, and Tyson Foods. These customer wins address the ongoing evolution of the requirements of global brands for an integrated workflow spanning creativity and marketing. This success is driven by product integration and innovation across Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud increasingly delivered through Adobe GenStudio.\n\nOur One Adobe enterprise go-to-market engine enables customers to deliver personalized and on-brand content at scale. The combination of our integrated enterprise solutions across creativity and marketing is a unique strength for Adobe. Next week, we are excited to host Adobe Summit, our flagship Digital Experience Conference in Las Vegas, where we'll be joined by thousands of customers, partners, and developers from around the world. We will share our vision for how brands can apply the power of generative AI and agentic technology to achieve personalization at scale, and look forward to highlighting a number of product innovations.\n\nI'll now pass it to Dan.\n\nDaniel J. Durn -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Anil. Adobe's business has grown over the last decade by delivering world-class products grouped within three clouds: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. In parallel, we've continued to expand across cloud offerings to better serve different customer groups. Examples include Acrobat, which is reflected in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud; GenStudio, which includes Creative Cloud, Express, Firefly Services, and Experience Cloud.\n\nEnterprises who want to engage with One Adobe in combined creative seats with marketing automation. And increasingly, Acrobat, and Express. We believe Adobe's success will be driven by innovation in service of both business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals. Reporting insights and the financial performance across these customer groups will provide a clear view of Adobe's execution against our strategy.\n\nWe will, therefore, provide overall Adobe revenue, digital media and digital experience segment revenue; digital experience subscription revenue and digital media ending ARR in aggregate rather than by cloud, as well as subscription revenue for business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals. Subscription revenue provided will primarily include revenue from SaaS, managed services, and term offerings. Business professionals and consumers group will consist of all subscription revenue from Document Cloud, Acrobat subscription revenue in Creative Cloud and Adobe Express subscription revenue in Creative Cloud, all of which are a part of digital media. Creative and marketing professionals group will consist of all subscription revenue from digital experience, as well as all of the remaining subscription revenue from Creative Cloud in digital media.\n\nIn today's call, I'll cover three main areas: our Q1 FY '25 results focusing on key growth drivers, financial targets, and our supplemental disclosures. Now turning to the quarter. In the first quarter of FY '25, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.71 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $4.14 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.08.\n\nQ1 business and financial highlights included, digital media revenue of $4.23 billion, digital media ending ARR of $17.63 billion, growing 12.6% year over year. Digital experience revenue of $1.41 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.48 billion. And exiting the quarter, remaining performance obligations were $19.69 billion, growing 12% year over year, and CRPO growing 11%. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $4.23 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 12% in constant currency.\n\nWe exited the quarter with $17.63 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year over year in constant currency. First quarter digital media growth drivers included: strong growth for Acrobat across all routes to market and geographies; Acrobat web and mobile growth driven by freemium funnel and app store optimizations; growth in Adobe Express, fueled by top-of-funnel improvements, PLG journeys across Acrobat and Express and B2B customer onboarding. Strength in user adoption and engagement of Acrobat AI Assistant driven by expansion of features, including support for additional languages and contract intelligence capabilities. Growth of creative flagship offerings driven by all apps, stock, imaging and photography.\n\nContinued momentum in creative web and mobile offerings with 35% year over year ending paid subscription growth, and strong momentum in the enterprise, driven by Firefly Services and the continued benefit from the upsell motion of generative AI-enabled offerings. Turning to our digital experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.41 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital experience subscription revenue was $1.30 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency.\n\nFirst quarter digital experience growth drivers included: momentum for product offerings across content, data and journeys; AEP and app subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year on year. GenStudio Solutions surpassing $1 billion in ending ARR book of business, early momentum in GenStudio for Performance Marketing and adoption and pipeline and improvements in overall enterprise retention. Turning now to our customer group performance. Creative and marketing professionals group subscription revenue was $3.92 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported.\n\nBusiness professionals and consumers group subscription revenue was $1.53 billion, which represents 15% year-over-year growth as reported. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 17% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. RPO exiting the quarter was $19.69 billion, growing 12% year over year or 13% in constant currency, and CRPO growing 11% year over year or 12% in constant currency. Our cash flows from operations in the quarter were a Q1 record $2.48 billion, and ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $7.44 billion.\n\nIn Q1, we entered into share repurchase agreements totaling $3.25 billion, and we currently have $14.4 billion remaining of our $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. Let me now turn to our Q2 FY '25 financial targets. For Q2 FY '25, we're targeting: total Adobe revenue of $5.77 billion to $5.82 billion; digital media segment revenue of $4.27 billion to $4.30 billion; digital experience segment revenue of $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion; digital experience subscription revenue of $1.315 billion to $1.325 billion; GAAP earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.85; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.95 to $5. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%.\n\nThe year is off to a good start and assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I'm pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for fiscal year 2025. This quarter's strong performance reflects Adobe's long-standing focus on innovation and meeting the growing needs of our broad customer base. As businesses increasingly prioritize digital transformation, we're uniquely positioned to deliver value through our highly differentiated solutions and proven go-to-market execution to unleash the power of creativity. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to drive growth for our customers as we continue to shape the future in the era of AI.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you next week at our investor meeting at Summit 2025. Thank you, and we'll now take questions. Operator?\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] The first question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. Shantanu, if you took the AI book of business, it would be low single-digit percent of your total revenue for the year. I guess many are asking, when does this become more material? How long does it take? What is required? Maybe just help us walk through the AI journey and how that translates to revenue.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nHappy to, Brent. If you take a step back and think about it, we've always talked about the AI journey as three parts. The first is ensuring that we innovate. The second is all about tracking usage and ensuring value and monetization.\n\nAnd I would say we're really pleased across all three of those journeys as we've had conversations with you folks as well in the past. A significant amount of the AI monetization is also happening in terms of attracting people to our subscription, making sure they are retained and having them drive higher-value price SKUs. So, when somebody buys Creative Cloud or when somebody buys Document Cloud, in effect, they are actually monetizing AI. But in addition to that, Brent, what we wanted to do was give you a flavor for the new stand-alone products that we have when we've talked about introducing Acrobat AI Assistant and rolling that out in different languages, Firefly, and making sure that we have a new subscription model associated with that on the web, Firefly Services for the enterprise and GenStudio.\n\nSo, the $125 million book of business that we talked about exiting Q1 only relates to that new book of business. And that's, again, stuff that we said we would double. But I think in terms of the impact also on the overall business, that has had a material part. But if you play this out a little bit more and you talk about what investors can expect, I think with the new Firefly app that's come out, this is a web product with a new subscription, ability to have the video model, ability to have ideation as part of it.\n\nThink of it as then integrating Photoshop web, Express web, and all of the other products, all of that is also upside. And you'll see a lot more innovation in that area and you'll see a lot more monetization in that area. And again, the last thing I'll probably say, Brent, is that the whole idea was to start to tee it up, and then again at the FA meeting, to continue to expand on how that is. But net-net, I would say, whether it's innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it.\n\nBrent Thill -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, Shantanu.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\n\nBrent Bracelin -- Analyst\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I wanted to double-click into the demand linearity you saw in the quarter. I appreciate the commentary reaffirming 11% digital media ARR growth guide for the full year.\n\nBut could you provide more color on trends you saw in the quarter across Creative and Document Cloud here? Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nYeah, happy to do that. So, again, just digital media ARR was a 12.6% growth, which is in line with our expectation and also the mix was in line with our expectations. If you take a step back and you look at the demand and sort of the way the business played out this quarter, it's consistent with what we've seen historically, and we've seen sort of a broad-based demand for the products with a few highlights that I think are worth calling out. First of all, as it comes to business professionals and consumers, this is obviously a huge market with billions of users that we're going after.\n\nAnd our strategy here is to really make sure that productivity that we deliver a solution for productivity from consumption all the way to creation and that's really what we're doing with Acrobat and Express. We saw a lot of momentum in these businesses. We talked about how Acrobat is up 23% year over year in terms of monthly active users. We're seeing stronger conversion on those users, and that's been helping drive the business.\n\nAI Assistant, obviously, we introduced that last year, continues to do very well and it's certainly helping with that strategy of faster consumption and conversational experiences. We saw 2x quarter-over-quarter usage growth in AI Assistant. And of course, in that context, Express has been a great product. The product right now is just -- it's an amazing product to use.\n\nAnd so, that also, we've been investing in very significantly. From a marketing standpoint but also from a partnership standpoint, we've doubled the partner ecosystem in the last year. It now includes new names like Miro and Box and Webflow and HubSpot. We have 85% more access -- 85% year-over-year growth in students with access to it.\n\nWe've been ramping up our student and campus ambassador programs. We added 6,000 new small, medium businesses to the Express product as well. And even within Acrobat, where we've been doing more -- we're seeing much more demand. We saw a 10x year-over-year engagement of Express capabilities from Acrobat users.\n\nSo, feeling really good about that audience group. On the Creative pro and creator side, Shantanu mentioned this already, but the introduction of the Firefly video model being used by PNC and Pepsi and Dentsu and PepsiCo and Stagwell, Firefly new offerings from Standard to Pro. And just yesterday, we introduced Premium, which is a much larger set of generative credits and all of those represent new monetization models. We introduced Photoshop mobile and web.\n\nWe saw hundreds of articles, 30 million social engagements. We were just listed as the focused app on the App Store over the weekend. We saw some great new advances for AI coming into Lightroom web and mobile. Premier also saw some great advances in terms of AI.\n\nSo, lots of momentum in that business. And what's really exciting is that as we've done all of this innovation, as Shantanu was talking about, we also have three big milestones coming up with Summit next week then NAB shortly after that, then MAXLondon shortly after that. And this is starting to show up. Obviously, we've talked about generation as we crossed 20 billion generations.\n\nWe're doing more than 1 billion generations now a month and 90% of people using Firefly the app also saw -- are generating video, as well as part of that. But we also saw a strong growth in the enterprise. I don't know, Anil, if you want to add something.\n\nAnil S. Chakravarthy -- President, Digital Experience\n\nYeah, exactly. To just echo what you were saying, I think in the enterprise, we see a lot of demand for creativity and marketing and AI coming together. Every CMO that we talk to, every agency that we work with, they're all very interested in how generative AI can be used to transform how the content supply chain works. And with the GenStudio offering, which combines the creativity and the marketing and the AI, we've seen tremendous traction and we saw a number of both customer wins, as well as a number of agency partners, and we look forward to unveiling a lot more of this at Summit.\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nSo, off to a great start, I think, with innovation, new offerings and you can expect to see new offerings and peers in the months ahead.\n\nBrent Bracelin -- Analyst\n\nHelpful. Look forward to talking to you next week. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question And thank you for the additional disclosure. I think it's a really interesting view kind of breaking down the creative and marketing professionals versus the business professionals and consumer group. And kind of following on that last question, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels kind of bullish to me that the business professionals and consumer group has a stronger growth rate, creative at 15% creative, and marketing professionals a little bit behind because it feels like business professionals and consumer group, those products would be faster sales cycle, particularly on the consumer side of the equation, faster adoption.\n\nThe creative and marketing professionals, this broader solution that you're trying to sell would have a longer sales cycle. So, the question is, am I thinking about that right? And are you seeing any indications that, that creative and marketing professional group, whether it's in your pipeline or sort of the activity you're seeing, could that catch up with what we're seeing from the business professionals and consumer group?\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, Keith, I mean, part of our goal was really to start to provide insight into by the customer groups, how we're starting to see it. And to some degree, when people are wondering how we are actually driving creative, and the reality is that when you think about the GenStudio set of products, which we now said is a $1 billion book of business, AEP and Apps is also a $1 billion book of business and the creative professional, that's actually addressing the entire content supply chain. And so, in terms of that growth rate, as we add new subscriptions like the Firefly app subscription, add more video, add more functionality in what we are doing with GenStudio, that growth rate as well, it's a very large untapped opportunity and people have been asking us questions about the strength of the creative market, as well as the strength of that market within the enterprise. And we think that's a large TAM, we'll share more.\n\nSo, I think you're thinking of it right, which is to say the $5 billion book of business that we built for digital marketing, that's really helping the content and the creative economy. And so, that was the idea behind giving you a window into that. And the metrics associated with that are subscription and different kinds of offerings. On the other side of the equation as well, to your point, what we wanted to do is reflect the fact that the investments that we made in both Acrobat and Express continuing to ensure distribution when we think about the monthly average users.\n\nIf you take it in aggregate, I mean, Adobe has hundreds of millions of people who are using monthly -- are using our products. And that will be really the early metrics and the indicators of how Express and Acrobat continue to grow. So, I'm glad that you found the additional disclosure beneficial. And that was the idea.\n\nAnd to Brent's earlier question as well, I just wanted to clarify. I mean, we are not taking all of the revenue that we see in digital media and digital experience and calling that AI revenue. But relative to what I've seen from any other company in our particular space, we've actually been pleased by how much of it, whether it's additional tiers of AI in the digital experience, so what we are seeing across Acrobat, as well as the creative professional space, there's been good adoption of AI in that. And so, that was the other intent, to start to show that so that we can talk about it more at the FA meeting.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nOutstanding. Can I sneak one last one in for Mr. Durn? It's great to see you guys take advantage of the pullback in the stock price by accelerating the share repurchase which picked up this quarter. Could this pace of share repurchases, can you guys sustain this throughout the year, or is that more of a one-time pickup?\n\nDaniel J. Durn -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. So, if I take a step back, Keith, and you think about the last four quarters, we've repurchased almost $11 billion. And we've always talked about if there's opportunities to be opportunistic along the way, we would take advantage of it. And I think that's what you saw play out in Q1.\n\nWe've got a strong point of view about the financial profile throughout the course of the year. Happy to reaffirm guidance, but we're going to drive that with strong operating margins, strong cash flow delivery, and be strong capital allocators throughout the year. So, we feel good about where we sit. And if there's opportunities to be opportunistic, we will.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nKeith, it's definitely a vote of confidence that we feel in what we are seeing as the opportunities ahead of us.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nYeah. It's great to see you guys putting your money where your mouth is by accelerating that share repurchase. It definitely helps.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Much appreciate the disclosure and the color and everything that goes with it. Shantanu, question for you.\n\nWhen you pivoted the company to a new business model through cloud, initially, there was a lot of skepticism. Then you proved to us that the TAM was actually larger in the new creative meets the cloud cycle. And the company was able to accelerate through the transition and put up even better margins and by expanding the TAM necessarily. So, as you look at AI right now, right now, one bearish argument that one could make, which I don't subscribe to, is that you're playing defense and that AI is a cost of staying in business and keeping yourself relevant to your creative base.\n\nBut how do you look, since you've been through this one big shift before, you've got a lot of experience, where is your conviction on how truly incremental AI can be for your growth? Could you be at a similar juncture where you're poised to get into the next cycle is actually bigger TAM, not to put words in your mouth, but even maybe dare I say the potential to accelerate off of the good growth that we've seen so far? Thank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, Kash, what I appreciate about the question is, this is what we wanted to really tee up in front of the FA meeting. But without a doubt, as David described, the opportunity for the business professional and consumers, I think you'll start to see and we'll share more at the FA meeting that there are billions of people that we can bring into the fold for creativity and productivity and talk more about how we're, with the distribution that we have and with the monthly average users that we have, monetize that much like we've monetized Acrobat. And we definitely believe that it's a massive, massive opportunity. I think it's the same thing across creators.\n\nThere are more creators that are entering. And again, I'll preview a little bit of what David will share, which is when you think about the web and mobile offerings that we're providing to attract more people to our platform as creative professionals and next-generation creators, the number of people who want to enter that profession is significantly larger than it's ever been. And so, with products like Photoshop on web and mobile, as well as Firefly app, that's clearly the intent to show how that as a subscription service and attracting the next generation creators will be a tailwind. And then when you put this together in the enterprise, I mean, hopefully, what you also see as part of the additional disclosures is that the enterprise has continued to be a material part of our business and material part of our growth because they are, in order to do personalization at scale, as Anil is talking about, there's going to be more content that's produced.\n\nThere's going to be more content that's actually inserted into ad systems and social media. And so, again, I think setting the stage for how that's a larger opportunity. But if you look at it from not just the length of we were marketing but look at the lens of, hey, that's a content business for us in the enterprise. We will again outline how that is only going to be a growing opportunity.\n\nSo, no question in my mind, all three of these are actually going to accelerate in terms of the TAM and then we have to innovate and execute against that. So, I am more excited about the larger opportunity without a doubt as a result of AI. And we've talked about this, Kash. If you don't take advantage of AI, it's a disruption.\n\nIn our particular case, the intent is clearly to show how it's a tailwind.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. And one follow-up and very quick, promise if I can. With the turbulence in the markets with trade wars, etc., tariffs, etc., how do you feel your customer base is going to behave? Is everything going to be on track from what you can tell by talking to your customers? Or are they kind of perplexed by what's going on and pausing? Thank you so much and that's it for me.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I mean, I think we just sort of said, assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I mean, we have a diverse business. We're off to a good start in the conversations that we are having. And all of us have conversations with all of our other peers. And I think we have a seasoned management team that will navigate it.\n\nBut customers, I think we're all jointly trying to understand what happens in the economy. But the tariffs, etc., don't really impact Adobe the way they impact other businesses. And so, we are optimistic.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\n\nMark Moerdler -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Dan, can you give us more color on why you're changing the categorization of revenue, removing the historical Document Cloud and Creative Cloud? Is this driven by the One Adobe sales motion? Is Express now sold predominantly with Document Cloud? How should we think about the drivers? Thank you.\n\nDaniel J. Durn -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, so thanks for the question, Mark. As we laid it out, we talked about increasingly driving cross-cloud offerings. We're already doing it today. We're going to be doing more of it going forward.\n\nAnd as you look at individuals increasingly buying offerings, as you look at enterprises increasingly buying solutions and bringing different parts of our portfolio together to meet their highest value needs around these two groupings of the customers, it really is meant to just draw a highlight to our strategy and how we're executing against that strategy. On a go-forward basis, our success is going to be driven by the way we innovate into the intersection of productivity and creativity, into the intersection of creativity and marketing. And those intersections are highlighted by these two groupings of customers. And so, the intent around this is to really bring to life how we're driving our strategy, how we're executing against it provides the best insight in how the company is performing on a go-forward basis.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd Mark, at least two specific things that we've heard as feedback from all of you folks are, you understand that there's an Acrobat within the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. This pulls out the business in order to show the momentum and the opportunity in that business. And to your question about One Adobe, yes, I mean, the GenStudio solution is, without a doubt, taking seats of products like Photoshop or the Creative Cloud, is adding Express in it for every marketer in there. We have Firefly Services and custom models.\n\nAnd so, the more we sell that as one enterprise offering and we want to accelerate the sale of that as a strategic partnership, that's now also all reflected in one of those revenue slices. So, we believe that the additional disclosure will also give you more visibility into routes to market.\n\nMark Moerdler -- Analyst\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. And one quick other one. Should we expect the disclosure on the AI ARR something that we'll be getting quarterly or periodically updated? Thank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nPeriodically.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks guys for taking the question. And I will join the chorus of those commenting positively on some of the new numbers, particularly the AI book of business. And that's where I wanted to ask the question. Basically, look, you're going to give us a number, we're going to ask for more.\n\nSo, in that spirit, if you look at the $125 million and you think about the segmentation between Assistant, Firefly, GenStudio, is there any triangulation around maybe how much -- what the percentages of for the breakout of those and maybe stack rank the growth rates that are going to get you to double that by the end of the year? And then kind of similarly, if you think about if that $125 million is impacting or where the tailwinds are more toward the creative and marketing professional or the business professionals?\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nYeah. Great question, Alex. So, first of all, if you look at the mix of these things, AI Assistant has been around for about three quarters or four quarters now. Firefly Service has been around for about four quarters as well.\n\nGenStudio was introduced late in Q4 of last year. So, that gives you a little bit of a sense that the composition is going to sort of like be based on the tenure of these products in the market. But if we take a step back and you look at the growth trajectory, again, we're talking $195 million -- sorry, $125 million doubling in the next nine months. It gives you a sense of the scale of these businesses and really the momentum that's in the business.\n\nAnd when you look at it, the core innovation that Shantanu talked about led to a lot of utilization. And now we're starting to get to a point where we can monetize it. For Firefly, we have imaging, vector, design, video, voice, video, and voice coming out just a couple of weeks ago, off to a good start. I know there have been some questions about how important is commercially safety of the models.\n\nThey're very important. A lot of enterprises are turning to them for the quality, the breadth but also the commercial safety, the creative control that we give them around being able to really match structure, style, set keyframes for precise video generation, 3D to image, image to video. The inclusion also, on a road map, and we'll share more about this next week of third-party models really establishes us as the one-stop shop for anything you need to do with creativity. And then when you ladder that into a Firefly stand-alone offer with multiple tiers with Standard, Premium, and Pro, when you look at that integrated into Creative Cloud, you could imagine further tiering there.\n\nWhen you look at the work that we're doing in conjunction with Anil's team around GenStudio and making sure all of these models and this entire platform, including third-party models are exposed within our GenStudio offer, what it's really doing is it's evolving away from the conversation being about the model to the conversation being about the workflows and the integration and the application tier and the agent-based things that we'll be talking to you more about. And that really plays to our differentiation, our strength, and our audiences that we serve. And that's why you see the bullishness of that $125 million doubling in the next nine months.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I'm glad that you find the sort of information useful. I'll give you a little bit more color as well on that. Remember, with Acrobat, we have AI Assistant that's separate, so this is only the separate Acrobat AI Assistant.\n\nSo, the majority of that revenue is actually Creative because as we can continue to put the AI Assistant as part of an Acrobat SKU. We would not count that if that came as part of an Acrobat Premium SKU. So, color-wise so far, creative actually represents the majority of that. But as you know, the Acrobat business is doing great.\n\nAlex Zukin -- Analyst\n\nThat's very, very helpful. I guess maybe just to follow along there. You've seen -- or we've seen a lot of consolidation start to happen within the AI realm where the model companies or the agent even emerging the agentic companies. Maybe just remind us on how you're thinking about your approach toward organic versus inorganic innovation here, given just the plethora of functionality that you're releasing across the board.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs it relates to the core creative models, we will have our commercially safe, as David said, Alex, and so within Firefly as an application and within each of our product integrations and Photoshop, etc., expect Firefly. We've also signaled and we've shown how we would support third-party models associated with that. And so, whether it's a custom model that we create for one of our enterprise customers, I think if you look at it, there have been a couple of articles this week about how whether it's Estee Lauder, who is going to be building their models built on ours and leveraging it or a company like Publicis that's going to be taking these models. So, our core imaging video franchise, we'll have our models as it relates to text, we have support for other third-party models.\n\nAnd so, I think it's a very practical and it's the right one, and we'll support all of the creative third-party models that people want to support, whether it's a custom model we create for them or whether it's any other third-party model within Firefly as an app and within Photoshop, you're going to see support for that as well. And so, think of it as we are the way in which those models actually deliver value to a user. And so, it's actually just like we did with Photoshop plug-ins in the past, you're going to see those models supported within our flagship applications. Hopefully, that gives you a sense.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question will come from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan.\n\nMark Murphy -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. I was wondering if you can just comment on what you're sensing fundamentally in terms of advertising activity and consumer spending trends in the wake of some very choppy results from multiple airlines the last several days and multiple retailers. What is giving you the resilience to reaffirm the FY '25 guidance when some of those are really huge sectors of the economy and they seem to be encountering some turbulence? I'm just wondering if there -- you basically see them continuing to create and market and advertise despite this environment.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think at the end of the day, Mark, we just believe that digital is going to continue to be a fundamental part of the economy and the importance is going to continue. I mean, there isn't a single company that I've talked to that doesn't say digital. To your point, as other companies view macroeconomic conditions that may be particular to them, onuses on every company that's serving them with technology to demonstrate how the technology helps, whether it's the top line or the efficiency. But whether it's top-line growth or efficiency or both, they're not going to go out of style as it relates to any enterprise saying, how can I use technology to accomplish my objectives?\n\nMark Murphy -- Analyst\n\nOK. I appreciate that, Shantanu. As a very quick follow-up on Alex's question, with the ARR, the $125 million ARR doubling in the next nine months, do you think it's going to be the same composition, or is something going to be coming in from the video models that might change the mix there in the next nine months?\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe video model is part of the creative Firefly app that will be part of this. I think a lot of these great questions, Mark, I mean, at the FA meeting, we'll try and give more color, as well as to what we are seeing. But we wanted to at least start to outline what products were in there, the growth rates that we expect, and how we're executing on, as I said, the innovation, usage, understanding, and offering these as monetization. So, we'll also, I know, keep a track of the ongoing questions and address them at the FA meeting as well, Mark.\n\nMark Murphy -- Analyst\n\nOK, great.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my question here and squeezing me in. I'll keep it to one. David, maybe for you. It's great to see the Firefly app tiers that customers can add to their existing subscriptions.\n\nAnd maybe to Shantanu's point, this is a better topic for FA Day, but I'm wondering if we could just talk about, how do you envision sort of the potential attach rate there? I mean, Firefly is clearly an unprecedented offering so maybe that's really tough to answer. But are there any products that maybe Adobe has seen in the past like Adobe Stock or any others that you look at as sort of a framework for what that adoption curve could look like?\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nYeah. I think, so if we take a look -- if you take a step back, the reason we're so excited about the Firefly app is really twofold. One is exactly where you're going, Saket, and what you're asking about, which is the -- with every conversation we've had with creative professionals, we know that wherever they are, they're under an enormous amount of pressure to produce more. And this cohort of creative professionals, we see very strong attach and adoption of the generative AI features we put in the product partially because they're well integrated and very discoverable and because they just work and people get a lot of value out of that.\n\nSo, what you will see is you'll start to see us integrating these new capabilities, these premium capabilities that are in the Firefly Standard, Pro, and Premium plans more deeply into the creative workflow so more people have the opportunity to discover them. And of course, as part of that, I think you can expect to see what we've done all along is look at where the usage is, look at where the excitement is, and make sure we get the pricing and the tiering right in a way that maximizes the opportunity for our customers and maximizes the opportunity and the value that Adobe and our shareholders get as part of that, too. So, that will be a big area and a big opportunity, and we see a lot of potential there as we look ahead. The other part that I want to make sure doesn't get lost in this is how relevant this Firefly experience is for noncreative professionals as well, this next generation of creators that we keep talking about.\n\nAnd if we look at the early adoption rates of the Firefly paid plan, it really tells us both of these stories. We have a high degree of conviction that it's adding value and being used by creative professionals, but it's also proving to be a good onboarding opportunity for next-generation pros and creators in general. And that's where Shantanu mentioned earlier, there is an increasing opportunity to merge our web and mobile offerings around not just the generative capabilities but what you do with the content you generate with Photoshop web and mobile, Express web and mobile. And you can imagine other capabilities coming around video as well.\n\nSo, we're excited about Firefly Services and the monetization capabilities there in both directions, new users and also value and ARPU for our existing base.\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd Saket, since that was the last question, thank you. And maybe just in a quick summary, I mean, the four things that I would leave you all with is Q1 was a strong start. We were pleased with our performance. When you think about the addressable markets that we have, as we think about how we serve the business professional and the consumer and the creative professional and the marketing professional, we believe that, that's an immense opportunity that's only going to grow as a result of AI.\n\nWe're pleased with how AI is now infused across all of our products and how we are further tailoring the breadth of our products to serve these customer groups in a way in which we delight them. And we're starting to outline how the monetization will be different for each one of these and applicable for the customer group that we are serving. We really continue to believe that this will drive growth and profitability for us as a company in '25 and beyond. And so, we look forward to joining you all at the FA meeting, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\nDuration: 0 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nSteve Day -- Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Digital Experience\n\nShantanu Narayen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDavid Wadhwani -- President, Digital Media\n\nAnil S.

            "content": "Adobe (ADBE) late Wednesday beat analyst estimates for its fiscal first quarter but offered mixed guidance for the current period. Adobe stock fell in extended trading.\n\nThe digital media and marketing software maker earned an adjusted $5.08 a share on sales of $5.71 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 28. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the San Jose, Calif.-based company to earn an adjusted $4.97 a share on sales of $5.66 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Adobe earnings rose 13% while sales increased 10%.\n\nAdobe's fiscal Q1 results marked the company's sixth consecutive quarter of slowing or flat earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Sales growth has been in a range of 10% to 11% for five straight quarters.\n\nFor the current quarter, its fiscal Q2, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $4.98 a share on sales of $5.8 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its outlook. Analysts were modeling earnings of $5 a share on sales of $5.8 billion. The midrange of Adobe's targets would translate to year-over-year growth of 11% in earnings and 9% in sales.\n\nAdobe also reaffirmed its prior guidance for the full fiscal year. It forecast earnings per share of $20.35, up 10.5%, on sales of $23.43 billion, up 8.9%, based on the midpoint of its outlook. However, Wall Street was modeling earnings of $20.39 a share on sales of $23.49 billion.\n\nIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Adobe stock sank more than 4% to 419.15. During the regular session Wednesday, Adobe stock rose 1.1% to close at 438.60.\n\nEstee Lauder Using Adobe Firefly\n\nShareholders have been waiting for Adobe's investments in generative artificial intelligence to reignite growth in the company's Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud businesses.\n\n\"Adobe is well-positioned to capitalize on the acceleration of the creative economy driven by AI,\" Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen said in a news release.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Adobe announced that cosmetics giant Estee Lauder Companies (EL) has adopted Adobe Firefly generative AI technology for its digital marketing efforts. Estee Lauder is using Firefly to accelerate content production.\n\nAdobe Firefly Services can handle repetitive tasks in workflows such as resizing and reformatting marketing assets for different media, Adobe said in a news release. Adobe has integrated Firefly with its Creative Cloud software.\n\nAdobe stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 59 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

Analysts, on average, estimated $5.8 billion. Profit, excluding some items, will be $4.95 a share to $5 a share, compared with the average projection of $5.\n\nAdobe, the top maker of software for creative professionals, has been incorporating its AI model, Firefly, into apps like Photoshop and Premiere. Investors have debated whether generative AI will make the products more lucrative and indispensable, or fuel the rise of AI-native competitors. During the quarter, Adobe announced it would charge about 50 cents per AI-generated video and separately announced price increases for some of its applications.\n\nShares declined about 3% in extended trading after closing at $438.60 in New York. Adobe\u2019s stock has slipped 24% over the past 12 months. Investor sentiment has primarily been driven by views of Adobe\u2019s AI, \u201cwhich has become increasingly interconnected with concerns around competition,\u201d wrote Matthew Swanson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAdobe is scheduled to host an event for investors next week in which the company is expected to provide additional long-range financial information and more details of its AI strategy.\n\nFiscal first-quarter revenue increased 10% to $5.71 billion, topping the $5.66 billion anticipated by Wall Street. Remaining performance obligations, a metric of future sales, were $19.7 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $19.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe digital media unit, which includes Adobe\u2019s flagship creative and document-processing software, posted a 11% increase in sales to $4.23 billion. Revenue from the unit that includes marketing and analytics software rose 10% to $1.41 billion.\n\n\u201cAdobe\u2019s success over the next decade will be driven by customer-focused innovation and new offerings for creators, marketing professionals, business professionals and consumers,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen said in the statement. \u201cAdobe is well-positioned to capitalize on the acceleration of the creative economy driven by AI and we are reaffirming our FY2025 financial targets.\u201d",

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The U.S. presidential election in Q4 2024 boosted U.S. equity markets, resulting in a strong year and overall positive year for global equities. The S&P 500 Index returned 2.41% during the quarter, and the index returned 25.02% for 2024. In the quarter, the fund returned 6.14% compared to the S&P Global 1200 Information Technology Index-net\u2019s 3.72% return. Security selection drove the fund\u2019s performance relative to the benchmark. In addition, you can check the fund\u2019s top 5 holdings for its best picks for 2024.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2024 investor letter, Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy emphasized stocks such as Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a technology company that operates through Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. The one-month return of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was -3.55%, and its shares lost 22.37% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On March 10, 2025, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock closed at $435.08 per share with a market capitalization of $189.215 billion.\n\nColumbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Against a backdrop of an increased competitive environment, shares of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) sputtered after the company reported strong quarterly results but provided a growth outlook that underwhelmed investor expectations. The software giant did outline an increased total addressable market opportunity, now expected at over $200 billion, from the prior $150 billion. However, the market is demanding more evidence that Adobe retains its competitive position against AI upstarts such as OpenAI or technology giants such as Google, which released their own versions of generative AI models (Sora and Veo/ Imogen, respectively) that pose a threat to Adobe\u2019s Firefly generative AI model.\"\n\nIs Adobe Inc. (ADBE) the Most Undervalued High Quality Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is in 13th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 117 hedge fund portfolios held Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 123 in the third quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

But before that, the software company will report quarterly earnings, and it\u2019s looking to bounce back from a massive stock price sell-off. Even though the company has exceeded earnings-per-share (EPS) and revenue estimates, the market pulled out of investing in Adobe to a pretty alarming degree.\n\nAt any rate, Adobe will report quarterly earnings on tomorrow, after the stock market closes. The software company is expected to announce earnings per share (EPS) of $4.97 on $5.66 billion in revenue. Both estimates are higher than last quarter, when Adobe exceeded both. ADBE stock sits around $435 per share, about $10 lower than at the beginning of the 2025 trading year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you just look at the price chart from 2025 to today, the stock is one of the only tech giants that hasn't been a victim of the broad market sell-off. It's hard to decipher whether this is good for Adobe stockholders, or whether traders and investors are waiting for the summit and earnings results.\n\nIt's always curious to see a company like Adobe beat earnings estimates handily and then have the stock price fall. It's a reminder that while earnings results can align with stock price movement, sometimes it's exactly the opposite.\n\nIn the last earnings call, Adobe executives offered words of positivity, with CEO Shantanu Narayen saying that \u201cAdobe delivered record FY24 revenue, demonstrating strong demand and the mission-critical role Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud play in fueling the AI economy ... Our highly differentiated technology platforms, rapid pace of innovation, diversified go-to-market and the integration of our clouds position us for a great year ahead.\u201d\n\nDan Durn, chief financial officer, added this: \u201cAdobe drove FY24 records of $21.51 billion in revenue, $8.06 billion in cash flows from operations and $19.96 billion in RPO ... Adobe\u2019s strategy, AI innovation and massive cross-cloud opportunity position us well for 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nWhile uncertainty is everywhere in the market, with huge swings each day the past few weeks, we always need to come back to the options market for context around this earnings announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on current implied volatility in the weekly options cycle for Adobe, we're looking at an 8% stock price range of +/- $36.27 against the notional value of a $435 stock price. This is on the higher end of most tech stocks because most have a range of 5%-10% ahead of earnings calls.\n\nLooking to the May 2025 options cycle, we can see an expected stock price move of +/- $56.99. That tells us the market is putting a ton of weight on this earnings announcement because this week makes up well over 50% of the expected range for the next 66 days. There is even heightened implied volatility for next week's Adobe Summit, which is interesting as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullish on ADBE stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on ADBE stock for earnings, you want to see continued strength under the hood. There\u2019s a feeling that an EPS and revenue beat is required in the current market, where we're seeing tech stocks fall 5%-10% each day. You'll want to hear a much better outlook for 2025 than during the last earnings call, which could be why the stock fell so dramatically. Either way, ADBE bulls will need to see drastic improvements in current success and forecasts if we're to see the stock price higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nBearish on ADBE stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bearish on ADBE stock for earnings, the sell-everything market environment certainly doesn't hurt your case. I would consider Adobe a \"fringe\" tech stock, in the sense that many more people who don't focus on the market too much would prefer to invest in one of the Magnificent Seven stocks at a discount than dabble with ADBE stock. With that said, the stock just sold off $100 after beating earnings estimates. If it fails to beat estimates this time, it could mean trouble for the stock price.\n\nTune in to Options Trading Concepts Live tomorrow at 11 a.m. CDT for an in-depth look at options strategies for Adobe earnings after the close.\n\n\n\nMike Butler, tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

            "content": "Adobe is updating its Adobe Stock service with an AI-powered feature called \"Customize.\" It allows anyone to \"refine and tailor\" stock images without ever needing to leave the Adobe Stock platform. In other words, you can make quick, easy adjustments to images, including AI-generated image variations, rather than spend hours editing in a separate app like Photoshop.\n\nAlso: The best photo editing software\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Adobe Stock is a paid service that gives you access to millions of assets to use in projects -- including photos, videos, illustrations, vector graphics, 3D assets, templates, and more. It's aimed at designers, marketers, business owners, etc.\n\nThe service lets you search, preview, and license any asset in its library directly from its website or within Adobe Creative Cloud apps, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. This integration is handy for those who like to add and manipulate assets right from the Adobe tools they're already using. But what about people who don't use Adobe's other apps? That's where Customize steps in to help.\n\nAI-powered edits in Adobe Stock\n\nThe new Customize feature is all about giving you more creative control over Adobe Stock assets. It includes AI image creation and edits, all powered by Adobe Firefly. With this tool, you can now make edits and quick adjustments to images directly in Adobe Stock. You can expand images, apply styles, and make other adjustments, but these require generative credits.\n\nAlso: Forget Sora: Adobe launches 'commercially safe' AI video generator. How to try it\n\nKeep in mind Adobe already offered its Firefly AI technology in Adobe Stock for business users. In 2024, it introduced Generative Edits and Generate Variations, allowing business users to use its AI tools to generate image variations and make edits, such as removing or replacing backgrounds, adjusting aspect ratios, and applying new styles or compositions.\n\nNow, Adobe said all users are able to \"refine multiple images at once,\" including changing \"aspect ratios to match the format of your project and harmonizing the style of multiple images.\" It also realizes that, as you're searching for images or making iterative changes to an asset, you might prefer a previous result. So, Customize lets you view the \"history of your search results and AI refinements.\"\n\nThat last part is key -- because Adobe Stock is using AI to help you with your images and implement changes to them. Adobe says creative professionals have been asking for AI features to handle their time-consuming tasks. It also mentioned Customize is just a preview of \"what's to come\" on Adobe Stock, and that it is \"continuing to add more generative AI features.\"\n\nHow to use Customize\n\nThe process is easy once you log in to your Adobe Stock account. Just be aware that Adobe's AI features require generative credits.\n\nSearch for assets: Use the search bar to find images, photos, or illustrations. Select an image: Choose an image you want to edit. Click on \"Customize\": Click on the \"Customize\" button to make adjustments. Refine your image: Use options like \"Expand Image\" or \"Apply Style\" to modify your image. Review your changes: View and track your edits, including all your AI-powered refinements. Download: Once you're done making edits, you will be able to download and use your finalized asset.\n\nWhen can you try Customize?\n\nThe Customize feature is now available for Adobe Stock users.\n\nAlso: Get Adobe's Photoshop for iPhone and web for under $8 per month\n\nIf you're subscribed to an individual or business plan, or using credits, you can begin using Adobe Stock's Customize feature today. Plans start at $30 per month for 10 assets or 1 video. Generative credits, which are required for Customize, are included with paid subscriptions. You can find more about how many credits are included with each plan here.",

            "content": "Adobe Acrobat is arguably the most popular cross-platform PDF editor, offering the free Adobe Reader and paid Acrobat Standard and Pro plans for document manipulation. With Big Tech normalizing chatting with your emails, documents, and tasks, Adobe naturally hopped on the trend and baked an AI assistant into Acrobat. The paid add-on Acrobat AI Assistant enables you to analyze PDF files, summarize contracts, ask questions, and more. Given that ChatGPT can perform similar tasks, we tested Adobe\u2019s new AI integration to see if it\u2019s worth the recurring fees.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nAdobe\u2019s AI is integrated into the Acrobat app (read our review) and available on mobile, desktop, and the web. While I couldn\u2019t personally get the AI window to load in the native macOS client, the features work reliably on the web app. Whether you\u2019re using the paid or the free version of Acrobat, accessing the AI perks requires a separate subscription that costs $8.25/\u00a34.98 a month or $70.68/\u00a358.90 when committing to an annual plan (with the option to pay in $5.89 monthly installments). Get Acrobal AI Assistant here.\n\nAdobe Acrobat Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, on the other hand, works on all major operating systems for free. While there is a daily cap on file uploads (PDF or otherwise), you can get around the limitation by copying and pasting large walls of text directly into the chatbot. To lift these restrictions altogether, you could subscribe to the $20/month Plus plan (approx \u00a315).\n\nPutting Acrobat\u2019s AI to the test\n\nAccording to an Adobe support document, the AI assistant in Acrobat is powered by the GPT-4o model. So, in theory, its performance should be comparable to that of ChatGPT. Both chatbots warn about potential errors and urge you to double-check sensitive details.\n\nFoundry\n\nOne of Adobe Acrobat AI\u2019s key features is contract analysis, which automatically extracts the significant bits\u2014such as the salary, obligations, relevant dates, etc. I tested the tool with several contracts, and it displayed the needed information correctly. It even highlights the missing details you\u2019d typically find in a contract, such as the early termination fee, liability, and audit rights. So, not only does it neatly summarize the document\u2019s content, but it also sheds light on absent bits you may want to inquire about before signing the contract.\n\nWhat I especially love about Adobe Acrobat AI is the citations next to each bullet point in the summary. These link to the original source in the document, letting you easily jump to a specific detail\u2019s location and check its context.\n\nAnother handy perk is the automatic follow-up questions that dynamically adapt to each contract. Instead of manually typing your inquiries, you can simply click on one of the relevant questions suggested by the chatbot. This enables you to ask about the detailed obligations, for example, without needing to formulate the inquiry on your own. You also get to ask it custom questions if the automatically generated ones don\u2019t address your concerns.\n\nIn addition to learning more about the analyzed contract, Acrobat\u2019s AI can generate emails based on the document\u2019s information. This makes responding to the other party simpler and more efficient.\n\nFoundry\n\nHow ChatGPT compares\n\nWhether you upload a PDF file to ChatGPT or directly paste the contract\u2019s text, the chatbot can generate key points in a comparable manner to Acrobat AT. Notably, the response doesn\u2019t include the specialized features that Acrobat offers, such as citations and follow-up questions, so you\u2019d have to manually search for relevant details in the original document and compose questions from scratch to receive similar answers.\n\nWhat stands out to me is how fast ChatGPT is at providing answers. In contrast, Acrobat\u2019s AI \u201cthinks\u201d for a couple of seconds before responding, but it excels in document analysis quality.\n\nFoundry\n\nIs Adobe\u2019s AI assistant subscription worth it?\n\nIf you professionally have to deal with multiple contracts a week, then Adobe Acrobat\u2019s AI may be worth the recurring fee. The chatbot is specifically designed to analyze documents and offers valuable insights when it detects a contract. You don\u2019t have to program or teach it what to do.\n\nOtherwise, if you\u2019re only handling a few contracts every once in a while, then ChatGPT\u2014whether you pay for it or not\u2014is probably sufficient. In this case, you\u2019d need to do the heavy lifting by manually guiding it, and you\u2019d still miss out on citations. You may find custom GPTs in the app that are better optimized for contract analysis.\n\nUltimately, Adobe offers a more convenient experience but at a cost, while ChatGPT provides broader utility without necessarily costing you a dime. If you\u2019re still unsure which chatbot to use for document analysis, you can try Adobe Acrobat\u2019s AI for free and decide once the trial expires.",

            "content": "OCTOPUS RAW Studio is a new Adobe Premiere Pro plugin specifically designed for Apple ProRes RAW and CinemaDNG footage. This plugin enhances Premiere\u2019s RAW capabilities by seamlessly integrating a next-gen unified RAW pipeline.\n\nIt is claimed to offer cutting-edge color science and an extensive set of powerful RAW controls, providing filmmakers with unparalleled control over their image.\n\nIt is also claimed to offer best-in-class highlight recovery and customisable roll-off for maximum dynamic range retention and film-like tonal reproduction. You can also dial in precise RAW settings such as white balance and ISO with ease. There is also the ability to use analogue and digital textures to synthesise film-grain or match sensor noise profiles.\n\nRAW Parameters\n\nConfigurable color science parameters are exposed through the OCTOPUS RAW Studio panel user interface. Each stage of the RAW processing pipeline is represented by a sub-section of the interface: Detail, Exposure, Tone, Color, Transfer and Tools. The Using parameter for each region allows switching between default As Shot camera metadata or Custom clip specific settings.\n\nDetail\n\nHighlight Recovery is our best-in-class proprietary algorithm to maximise usable dynamic range where highlight data is partially clipped (i.e. 1 or 2 channels of the image is clipped).\n\n\n\nTexture is an optional processing step which simulates signal-to-noise ratios. Analogue texture simulates a celluloid signal-to-noise ratio using a non-linear luminance and chromaticity table. Digital texture simulates CMOS signal-to-noise using linear modulation.\n\nExposure\n\nExposure Index modifies the ISO regardless of the ISO the clip was shot at. This feature is only available where clips contain ISO metadata.\n\n\n\nEv +/- allows for precise relative exposure adjustments.\n\nTone\n\nTone controls expose standard sliders for shaping the image across the exposure range: Contrast, Highlights Shadows and Blacks.\n\nColor\n\nWhite Balance controls allow for precise matching of output white reflectance to the color temperature of scene light sources. This can be set either using standard presets for standard light sources or fully customisable with Temperature and Tint values.\n\n\n\nSaturation is a standard saturation algorithm to remove or add color to the image.\n\n\n\nHighlight roll-off is our bespoke implementation of filmic roll-off as highlights approach clipping. Our implementation applies a non-linear desaturation curve emulating the desaturation behaviour of celluloid film as it becomes fully transparent. Only applicable for Rec. 709 output.\n\n\n\nShadow roll-off similar to highlight roll-off, applies a non-linear desaturation curve to shadows as they approach black. Shadow roll-off can help mask the digital nature of CMOS noise in shadows.\n\nTransfer\n\nThe Transfer sub-section controls the final stage of RAW processing before the image is transferred to the host NLE application.\n\n\n\nGamma & Color Spaces allow you to choose the output gamma and color space of the image before it is passed to the host NLE application. See supported gamma spaces and color spaces.\n\n\n\nLUT allows you to apply a look-up table transformation to the image before it is passed to the host NLE application. The LUT option offers built-in LUTs for manufacturer log gamma spaces and custom LUT loading for .cube format LUTs.\n\nNote:\n\nLUTs can only be applied to log gamma spaces and are applied after the gamma and color space transform.\n\nGamut compression is an optional step to manage colors outside the range of the output color space. Only applicable for Rec. 709 color space output.\n\n\n\nSDR Tone Mapping is recommended because the standard Rec. 709 gamma curve limits images to a narrow dynamic range of 6/7 stops. Applying tone mapping preserves greater dynamic range by compressing all exposure values non-linearly into the standard Rec. 709 range. Only applicable for Rec. 709 gamma space output.\n\n\n\nWhite Level & Black Level allow you to remap the darkest and brightest possible pixel values within the 0.0 to 1.0 range.\n\nTools\n\nOverride & Global Override \u2018As Shot\u2019 allow you to export sidecar metadata either for a clip or globally for every clip under a folder. Overrides provide a mechanism to alter the default RAW parameters loaded when clips are set to use \u2018As Shot\u2019 metadata. For a clip-specific override, use the Override \u2018As Shot\u2019 export to create a sidecar with the same name and path as the clip \u2013 with the extension: .as-shot\n\n\n\nClip-specific override example:\n\nClip /Media/A001/MOV_PRORES_RAW_CLIP_01.mov\n\nSidecar /Media/A001/MOV_PRORES_RAW_CLIP_01.as-shot\n\n\n\nFor a global override, use the Global override \u2018As Shot\u2019 export to create a sidecar in the same folder as the clip \u2013 with the filename: global.as-shot\n\n\n\nGlobal override example:\n\nClip /Media/A001/MOV_PRORES_RAW_CLIP_01.mov\n\nClip /Media/A001/MOV_PRORES_RAW_CLIP_02.mov\n\nSidecar /Media/A001/global.as-shot\n\n\n\nGlobal override sidecars will affect all clips in the same folder or subdirectories. In situations where multiple sidecars are in play (i.e. both a global and clip-specific sidecar present) \u2013 the metadata will be automatically merged with clip-specific overrides taking precedence.\n\nNote\n\nWhen creating or modifying sidecar files, affected clips may need to be re-imported in Adobe Premiere Pro for changes to take effect.\n\nHint\n\nSidecar files are stored in human readable JSON format which can be manually edited in text editing applications.\n\nSupported color spaces\n\nRec. 709\n\nRec. 2020\n\nARRI Alexa Wide Gamut\n\nRED Wide Gamut\n\nBlackmagic Wide Gamut\n\nSony S-Gamut3.Cine\n\nCanon Cinema Gamut\n\nDJI D-Gamut\n\nPanasonic V-Gamut\n\nACES AP1\n\nSupported transfer & gamma spaces\n\nRec. 709\n\nRec. 2020 HLG\n\nsRGB\n\nARRI LogC3\n\nRED Log3G10\n\nBlackmagic Film Gen. 5\n\nSony S-Log3\n\nCanon C-Log2\n\nDJI D-Log\n\nPanasonic V-Log\n\nNikon N-Log\n\nACEScct\n\nBuilt-in LUTs\n\nARRI LogC3 to Rec. 709\n\nRED Log3G10 to Rec. 709\n\nBlackmagic Film Gen. 5 to Rec. 709\n\nSony S-Log3 (S-Gamut3.Cine) to Rec. 709\n\nCanon Log 2 to Rec. 709\n\nDJI D-Log to Rec. 709\n\nPanasonic V-Log to Rec. 709\n\nNikon N-Log to Rec. 709\n\nACEScct (AP1) to Rec. 709\n\nOCTOPUS RAW Studio is a certified Apple ProRes RAW product with support for over 60 cameras.\n\nPricing\n\nYou can try RAW Studio today with a fully functional trial version (export limited to 250 frames).\n\nYou can also purchase a license to unlock the full capabilities of a unified RAW workflow.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, provided important guidance to investors last Friday, emphasizing the difficult market conditions ahead. He highlighted the instability caused by President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. Cramer warned that this uncertainty could lead to further losses for investors. Looking ahead to the coming week, Cramer pointed out a significant event on Wednesday when the consumer price index (CPI) data will be released. He added:\n\n\u201cI'll tell you this, If we get a soft CPI and a soft PPI on Thursday, the drumbeat of a rate cut will grow so loud, so loud, it might even overshadow the pained forecast for the White House. With cool inflation meetings, the Fed has no reason not to cut.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Commented On These 6 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer and Analysts Like These 10 Stocks\n\nCramer turned his attention to Friday when the Michigan consumer sentiment number will be reported, acknowledging that this indicator was not something he paid much attention to during President Biden\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI didn't focus on this number much at all under President Biden because Biden was very predictable so it was easy to make plans. Sure, Wall Street's hated many of Biden's policies, especially on interest, but he rarely took us by surprise. Trump surprises us every day.\u201d\n\nCramer pointed out the importance of consumer sentiment, stating, \u201cWe\u2019re a consumer-driven economy, people.\u201d He explained that if optimism prevails, some stocks that might seem risky could actually be good buys.\n\nOn the other hand, if pessimism takes hold, many fund managers may sell off stocks tied to the economy, only to see those same stocks rebound once the selling pressure subsides. Cramer also highlighted an important point: while markets can absorb negativity, they cannot handle uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: Look, it's one of the toughest markets I've seen in years... So if you wanna buy a stock, make sure not to buy it all once. Buy slowly because the stock you purchase might be down five points by the time you get your report.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 7. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.",

Today, Mark Phibbs believes agencies need to step up as strategic partners, bringing fresh thinking to the table while in-house teams take ownership of execution.\n\nPhibbs is clear that agencies need to evolve from being execution partners into becoming \u201cideas factories.\u201d While traditional agency models involved handling everything for a brand \u2013 briefing, strategy, execution and creative \u2013 he sees a shift happening. \u201cIn the past, agencies did everything for us,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d give them a brief for a campaign and they\u2019d handle it all. But marketing has changed. We now have multi-channel complexity and the days of taking months to create a campaign are over. You need to be able to turn around a video in a day.\u201d\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nTo stay competitive, at Cisco, where he was vice-president of global campaign, content and industries marketing until November 2024, he moved much of the company\u2019s content creation in-house. \u201cMarketers need to move quickly and the best way to do that is with an in-house creative team that\u2019s skilled with Adobe tools and can respond in real-time,\u201d he explains. \u201cMarketing today is social-first. Job one is to win on social.\u201d\n\nSo, where do agencies fit into this new model? \u201cI look for agencies to be ideas factories. They should be a second set of brains. Smart people who can review what we\u2019re doing and bring fresh perspectives.\u201d He highlights social transformation agency 1000Heads as a strong example of a strategic partner. \u201cIt is brilliant at thinking strategically. That\u2019s what I value in an agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy agencies can\u2019t just execute any more\n\nThe shift towards in-house marketing capabilities doesn\u2019t mean agencies are becoming obsolete \u2013 it means they need to offer something different. Phibbs believes that in a world where speed is crucial, marketing teams must own creative execution. \u201cThe days of waiting weeks or months for a piece of creative to be developed externally are over,\u201d he says. \u201cAt Cisco, we built internal teams that can create video content, social assets and campaign materials on demand. That\u2019s the future of marketing.\u201d\n\nBut agencies still have a critical role to play, especially in challenging in-house teams to think differently. \u201cI expect agencies to bring bold, innovative thinking. I want them to tell me what we haven\u2019t thought about. I don\u2019t need an agency to execute standard campaigns. I need them to bring ideas we wouldn\u2019t have come up with on our own.\u201d\n\nPhibbs also believes that agencies must be adaptable. \u201cAgencies that cling to old ways of working \u2013 slow, bureaucratic processes \u2013 will struggle to survive. Agility is everything now. The ability to pivot quickly, adjust messaging in real-time and react to cultural moments is what separates the best agencies from the rest.\u201d\n\nInsights and analytics\n\nPhibbs is passionate about marketing teams taking ownership of data and insights. \u201cMost marketing organizations don\u2019t invest enough in insights. They might have 1% or 2% of their team dedicated to it. But marketing needs to understand the data better than any other function. We are the ones who engage with customers the most through digital channels, websites and social media. We should know what content resonates best and why.\u201d\n\nThat means agencies must align with a brand\u2019s data-driven approach. \u201cI don\u2019t want an agency telling me what it \u2018feels\u2019 will work \u2013 I want it to show me data-backed insights. An agency that can interpret data and turn it into creative ideas is invaluable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChallenges facing CMOs\n\nWith the average tenure of a CMO now being little more than 18 months, Phibbs acknowledges that marketing leaders are under intense pressure from the C-suite and have limited time to make an impact. \u201cSmart CMOs realize they have limited time, so they better be willing to take risks. If you\u2019re not brave in your marketing, you\u2019ve got no chance of success. The most dangerous thing a CMO can do today is play it safe.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, marketing budgets continue to shrink, forcing leaders to do more with less. \u201cMarketing budgets are always under pressure, but that has accelerated in recent years,\u201d says Phibbs. At the same time, technology and artificial intelligence are rapidly transforming the industry. \u201cUnderstanding AI, identifying real use cases and demonstrating cost savings or customer experience benefits is critical.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge, though, is proving marketing\u2019s value to the business. \u201cMarketing needs to be able to show its impact. At Cisco, we made great progress in linking engaged demand to revenue. We could prove that customers who engage deeply with our marketing spend more money with us.\u201d\n\nAs president of the jury for The Drum Marketing Awards APAC, Phibbs says he is keen to see entries that really push the boundaries of what marketing can be. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking for genuine creative chops \u2013 campaigns that take an innovative approach and break through the clutter. There\u2019s so much noise in our lives today. Marketers need to think about how they can stand out and differentiate their brands.\u201d\n\nAnd beyond creativity, Phibbs wants to see measurable business impact. \u201cWhat\u2019s the return on investment of the campaign? Did it achieve its strategic intent? And how did it leverage different elements of the marketing mix?\u201d\n\nWith a career including marketing leadership roles at four of the world\u2019s most influential and innovative tech brands \u2013 IBM, Microsoft, Adobe and Cisco \u2013 Phibbs sees judging The Drum Awards for Marketing as an opportunity to contribute to the next generation of marketers. \u201cI\u2019m towards the later end of my marketing career and I love giving back. I do guest lecturing at universities and I think it\u2019s our role as senior marketers to share our knowledge and help younger marketers move forward.\u201d\n\nFor Phibbs, judging is also a huge learning opportunity. \u201cI always walk away with new ideas. There\u2019s always something to learn. No one has all the answers and the best marketers are those who stay open to new ways of thinking.\u201d\n\nThe future of agency partnerships\n\nPhibbs is clear about where he sees the future of agency-brand relationships going. \u201cB2B marketing is having a moment right now. And I think it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\u201d For agencies, that means evolving to become strategic partners rather than simply creative service providers. \u201cThe best agencies are the ones that challenge CMOs, bring fresh thinking and help CMOs navigate complexity. Marketing is faster, more data-driven and more creative than ever before. Agencies that embrace that shift will thrive.\u201d\n\nWith leaders like Phibbs pushing the industry forward, the expectations of agencies are higher than ever. The challenge for agencies today is to step up, be bold and embrace the role of the ideas factory.",

Adobe continues to innovate and extend its reach within industries, effectively positioning itself for years of rogue growth and ever-increasing success thereafter.\n\nAdobe Systems Digital Media Revenue\n\n(Reference: statista.com)\n\nThe department under which Adobe\u2019s digital media segment falls has been growing like a tree since 2016. In 2024, it produced almost USD 15.55 billion in revenue, an amount derived purely from Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud statistics show the continuous increment in Adobe\u2019s market reach, which it is making for itself while growing in the sectors of content production and document management.\n\nForecasting ahead, revenue is expected to jump dramatically, reaching over USD 20 billion as early as 2025.\n\nThis expected growth indicates a surge in demand for Adobe\u2019s cloud applications and consistent innovations in all things creative and document-related.\n\nAdobe Financial Projections for FY 2025\n\nFor FY 2025, Adobe anticipates overall revenue from USD 23.3 billion to USD 23.55 billion. Their Digital Media division (Creative Cloud and Document Cloud) is projected to contribute about USD 17.25 billion to USD 17.40 billion to the revenue.\n\nThus, the ARR in this segment highlights sustained demand for Adobe\u2019s subscription service with anticipated growth of approximately 11% year-on-year.\n\nThe Digital Experience, which includes Adobe Experience Cloud naturally and its related services, is expected to amount to around USD 5.80-USD 5.90 billion, with subscription revenues accounting for USD 5.375-USD 5.425 billion.\n\nThe company expects EPS for the year to be approximately USD 15.80-USD 16.10 (GAAP) and USD 20.20-USD 20.50 (non-GAAP).\n\nThe company targets almost a non-GAAP operating margin of 46%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5%, and an approximate diluted share count of about 433 million for the fiscal year.\n\nAdobe Financial Projections for Q1 of FY 2025\n\nFor Q1 of FY 2025, Adobe forecasts total revenue at between USD 5.63 billion and USD 5.68 billion.\n\nDigital Media is expected to be between USD 4.17 and USD 4.20 billion, with the Digital Experience realm recording USD 1.38-USD 1.40 billion.\n\nThe Digital Experience anticipates a subscription revenue contribution of USD 1.27-USD 1.29 billion. Adobe expects EPS of around USD 3.85-USD 3.90 (GAAP) and USD 4.95-USD 5.00 (non-GAAP) for Q1.\n\nThese projections are highly reflective of continued strong performance and growth of the company across all digital platforms.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud Collaborations and Project Management\n\nAdobe employees, whether they be the most creative or otherwise, even as they are also being asked to do more work under the same conditions now, nothing changes in that regard.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud statistics show that 28% of non-creatives and 22% of creatives agree that their companies are giving them more work assignments. 60% of both groups report that they expect to complete their tasks quicker than before.\n\nCollaboration and project management are the main constraints on speed, and they continue to hinder smooth workflow processing.\n\n70% of creatives mention project management as a significant pain point, with 27% stating they do not have sufficiently clear project requirements and 26% are struggling with the reviews.\n\nGenerative AI comes as a possible silver bullet; its supposed efficiency-enhancing capabilities have made waves lately among many professionals. As said by the Senior Designer, Havas Play, Lewis Oliver, the tools in Creative Cloud enable instant sharing and collaborative editing of files by mass users.\n\nThey are all going to make the tasks of collection feedback and document sharing less painfully slow and ensure better team collaboration.\n\nFor example: 26% of creatives want to automate tracking reviews, and although 60% agree that project management features could enhance efficiency, only 14% prefer to reduce review time.\n\nAnother 50% of non-creatives face challenges of collaboration, they ask themselves what to do when 30% face extremely long waiting time for reviews; 22% struggle with version control; and 19% with file sharing during reviews.\n\nImproved project management tools and AI-driven tools would hold the key to streamlining workflows, enhancing efficiencies, and removing manual process burdens in both creative and non-creative environments.\n\nAdobe Market Share\n\n(Reference: vstar.com)\n\nAccording to Adobe Creative Cloud statistics, the usage of Adobe Photoshop makes it currently the highest among the shares for creative software users at 34% of the total market. The dominance reflects the software\u2019s being widely used by all and sundry professionals and amateurs for different activities for photo-editing, graphic design, and digital artistry. Extensive features, industry-standard tools, and continuous innovation through AI have made it a popular provider of the service.\n\nFollowing Adobe is the Creative Suite with a market share of 24%. Many users still use this line comprising older versions of software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign even after Adobe went for cloud-based form services. This illustrates a considerable segment that prefers the conventional license mode of purchasing software rather than subscriptions.\n\nThis new subscription-based model, Adobe Creative Cloud, to replace Creative Suite, signs at 13% in such terms. Though not as good as the Creative Suite, it keeps growing as more and more users are accustomed to cloud-based workflows. Such people wish for an access-all-adobe-apps-with-cloud-storage-and-ai-sold-easy features app that packs into the heads of contemporary designers and businesses.\n\nAdobe Illustrator is the most popular software used by graphic designers, branding professionals, and artists for high-quality scalable artwork. It has a market share of 8%. Although its niche usage is not as lavishly broad as that of Photoshop, this keeps it steady in its measure.\n\nMicrosoft Visio is a 4% market share of the specialized tool for diagramming and vector graphics. This application is used widely in business for generating flowcharts, organograms, and network diagrams. While it does not directly compete with Adobe\u2019s creative suite, it has a small but stable territory in the industry.\n\nAmong them, the other creative software tools add up to 17%.\n\nThis includes all the design, editing, and illustration tools from all the other contenders such as CorelDRAW, Affinity Designer, Sketch, and many up-and-coming creative platforms, basically compiling all of the otherwise interested users in cost-effective or specialist designs outside the Adobe ecosystem.\n\nAdobe Stock Price\n\n(Source: vstar.com)\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud statistics show that over the quarter, Adobe stock has been rather disappointing, recording a very large drop-off of 22.1% from the opening price of USD 561.11 to the closing price of USD 444.76.\n\nThis drop is a complete disconnected view from the broader market indices, the leading index, the S&P 500, climbing at only a modest 2.7%, and the NASDAQ 100 rising at just 1.3%.\n\nThe differentiation prompts that Adobe\u2019s stock has suffered from something when not the most, company-specific problems or worries that hit investor confidence, while the rest of the market nonetheless fared quite well.\n\nFor the complete quarter, Adobe had some very high-volatility trading sessions, with stock moving high as USD 585.35 and low at USD 433.97.\n\nSuch huge movement evidences the awful uncertainty and performance instability of the specific stock, most likely induced by external issues related to industry trends, the company\u2019s earnings result, or general investor sentiment. With the fall, Adobe is still keeping a remarkable market capitalization of USD 199.25 billion, showing its place in the industry\u2019s shoes.\n\nAs steeply as the price drops, however, it seems to hint that investors harbor doubts about future growth potential, competitive standing, or financial performance.\n\nThis fall would seem to indicate that the market perception of Adobe has undergone some turnabout on what could be revenue forecasts, competition, or net effects that impact the technology sector as a whole.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud\u2019s Strong Growth and Adoption\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud has existed for over a decade, and the software is becoming increasingly popular worldwide.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud statistics from the recent past thus prove that it is growing and yet being universally adopted. According to Adobe\u2019s financial results for the year 2024, the Creative Cloud segment recorded an increase of 10.9% in recurring revenue over the last year.\n\nPrevious annual growth rates were thus: 12.7% in 2023, 13.4% in 2022, and 17.3% in 2021.\n\nAs the 12 million-odd paid subscribers were counted in 2017, by the end of 2020, Adobe estimated about 85% growth for the Creative Cloud business since then.\n\nFollowing these trends, the estimated number of total Creative Cloud subscribers by December 2024 is around 37 million. This number denotes more than double the number of subscribers from five years ago and represents an increase of around 3.63 new subscribers added in the last one year.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud statistics reveal that by adding new subscribers to almost 1 million every quarter, Adobe has revolutionized the subscription intake to around 10,000 active paid members being subscribed in daily operations and will be seeing its upcoming CC 2025 product line.\n\nPrior to its move to a subscription-only model, around 12.8 million users had installed Adobe Creative Suite (CS) software in approximately 10 years. There have been over two times this many since Creative Cloud began 12 years ago.\n\nAn important aspect of this setup is that every Creative Cloud user now has the latest software updates and so can work together on the same version.\n\nAdobe stopped selling CS6 eight years ago because Creative Cloud offered better value for the price. Creative Cloud provides access to almost all Adobe products for a simple monthly fee without large upfront costs.\n\nThus, for the present, this subscription model has made Creative Cloud one of the most talked-about and successful offerings of Adobe.\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to Adobe Creative Cloud statistics, Adobe upholds its stronghold in the creative software industry through Adobe Creative Cloud, which currently boasts a subscriber base of nearly 30 million, a healthy financial bottom line, and space for increasing innovation. With AI tools like Adobe Firefly and resources like Adobe Stock, the company is living its motto\u2014\u2019User Experience and Need\u2019. Such initiatives give more credence to Adobe\u2019s already well-known will to do better.\n\nShared On:\n\n\n\nSources Adobe Prodesigntools Vstar Adobe Statista Statista\n\nFAQ . How many users does Adobe Creative Cloud plan to have in 2024? According to 2024 data, Adobe Creative Cloud has nearly 30 million subscribers, with expectations of reaching 37 million subscribers by the end of the year. With a consistent addition of almost 1 million new subscribers per quarter, such data continue to show a very robust adoption globally. What is the revenue of Adobe from Creative Cloud and its digital media segment? Inside Digital Media, which includes Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, contributed US$15.55 billion to Adobe\u2019s revenue in 2024. It is inferred that its revenue projections should exceed US$20 billion in 2025 due to high demand for Adobe cloud-based creative and document solutions. How does Adobe incorporate generative AI (GenAI) into its Creative Cloud offerings? Adobe has integrated GenAI within its cloud-based offerings: Firefly, an inventive model that automatically creates creative assets with text prompts; and Adobe Sensei, supporting developing personalised content for consumers and marketing workflows in Adobe Experience Cloud. What are the primary problems that creative professionals face with Adobe Creative Cloud? The most significant problems there are for creatives using Creative Cloud are: Collaboration and project management problems (as indicated by 70% of creatives). Ambiguity over project requirements (27%) and hindrances in the review process (26%) create issues. The rest of the bunch: non-creatives also complain about file sharing, version control, and lengthy review times. What does the market share look like for Adobe in the creative software market? The market for creative software is splintered into a thousand pieces, and Adobe has been quite good at holding onto these pieces: Photoshop \u2013 34% market share (the leading image editing software). Creative Suite \u2013 24% market share (old software still used by most). Creative Cloud \u2013 13% market share (-challenging and growing cloud-based subscription model). Illustrator \u2013 8% market share (the preferred tool for vector graphics). How has Adobe\u2019s stock performed in 2024? Adobe\u2019s stock fell by 22.1% in the quarter, going from US$561.11 to US$444.76, even when the market was stable. The fall is attributed to investors\u2019 fears of competition and revenue expectations. Nevertheless, Adobe still commands a market capitalisation of US$199.25 billion and remains the crowning glory of the creative software industry.\n\nJoseph D'Souza Joseph D'Souza founded ElectroIQ in 2010 as a personal project to share his insights and experiences with tech gadgets.

            "content": "The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express happens to be one of the best elite cards that business owners know and love. The Amex Business Platinum card, with its $695 annual fee (rates & fees), has an impressive line-up of benefits and perks that easily justify the hefty annual fee.\n\nOne such benefit is the Adobe credit, which offers up to $150 in statement credits every year on eligible purchases. However, there are a ton of terms and conditions you\u2019ll need to abide by in order for your purchase to qualify for this benefit, as not many Adobe purchases will trigger this statement credit.\n\nSo in this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to use this credit for maximum value. Let\u2019s get right into it!\n\nHow To Enroll and Use the Amex $150 Adobe Credit\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum card\u2018s Adobe credit of $150 per year is valid only for a few purchases and subscriptions. We\u2019ve seen countless stories of people trying to use their Amex Business Platinum card to pay for random Adobe purchases only to find out that they were not reimbursed. You\u2019ll want to read the rest of this article very closely to make sure your purchase qualifies.\n\nTo start off, you will need to enroll in the Business Platinum Adobe Benefit before making any purchases or setting up any subscriptions. To do so, simply log into your Amex online account. Then, click Rewards & Benefits on the top menu, followed by Benefits. After that, hover to the Business Platinum Adobe Benefit box and click Get Started.\n\nYou\u2019ll then see a box that looks like this:\n\nImage Credit: American Express\n\nCheck off the box that says I Understand and agree to the terms and conditions and click Enroll.\n\nOnly certain annual prepaid subscriptions will be eligible for the $150 credit, so keep that in mind, as well. Remember, only subscriptions made directly with Adobe are eligible for the $150 credit.\n\nLastly, annual prepaid subscriptions renew automatically every year until canceled, so keep that in mind.\n\nAfter the Adobe credit is activated, simply use your Amex Business Platinum card to pay for any eligible Adobe subscription via this link, and you\u2019ll see a statement credit of up to $150 per calendar year posted to your account within 2 to 4 weeks after the purchase is made.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the $150 credit, call the number on the back of your card to check on the status of the credit.\n\nTypes of Eligible Subscriptions with Adobe\n\nImage Credit: Emily Bernal via Unsplash\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the types of eligible subscriptions.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud All Apps for Teams\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a suite of software applications that include:\n\nAcrobat Pro\n\nAcrobat Reader\n\nAdobe Express\n\nAero\n\nAfter Effects\n\nAnimate\n\nAudition\n\nBridge\n\nCapture\n\nCharacter Animator\n\nDimension\n\nDreamweaver\n\nFill & Sign\n\nFresco\n\nIllustrator\n\nInCopy\n\nInDesign\n\nLightroom\n\nLightroom Classic\n\nMedia Encoder\n\nPhotoshop\n\nPhotoshop Camera\n\nPhotoshop Express\n\nPremiere Pro\n\nPremiere Rush\n\nScan\n\nXD\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is sold in these plans:\n\nIndividuals\n\nStudents and teachers\n\nTeams\n\n\n\nOnly Teams plans are covered under Amex Business Platinum card\u2019s $150 Adobe credit, and prepaid, annual plans start at $1,019.88 per year per license.\n\nSome features exclusive to Teams subscriptions include:\n\nAdmin Console for managing licenses\n\nAdvanced 24/7 tech support\n\n2 1:1 expert sessions per user per year\n\nUnlimited job posts using Adobe Talent\n\nSlack and Microsoft Teams app integration\n\n1TB of cloud storage, Adobe Portfolio, Adobe Fonts, and access to the latest features and updates as soon as they\u2019re released\n\nSo, using the $150 Adobe credit would save you around 15% off of your total subscription fees. For this reason, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend going out of your way to purchase an Adobe subscription just to use the Adobe credit \u2014 but it would definitely make sense to pay using your Amex Business Platinum card if you actually use Adobe software to help run your business.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud Single Apps (Teams Subscriptions Only)\n\nIf you don\u2019t need the complete suite of products included in Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps, you can set up an annual prepaid subscription for single apps.\n\nHowever, all of these subscriptions must still be for Teams.\n\nIn other words, instead of buying the Creative Cloud package, you can purchase Adobe Creative Cloud applications \u00e0 la carte.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of how much each Creative Cloud for Teams application costs:\n\nAdobe Stock \u2014 $359.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $359.88 per year per license Adobe XD \u2014 $275.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $275.88 per year per license After Effects \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Animate \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Audition \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Dreamweaver \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Illustrator \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license InCopy \u2014 $59.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $59.88 per year per license InDesign \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Lightroom (1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n(1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license Photoshop \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Premiere Pro \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Substance 3D Collection \u2014 $1,199.88 per year per license\n\nAdobe Stock enables you to access millions of high-quality, royalty-free assets for your next creative project.\n\nAdobe XD is a UI/UX software for designing, prototyping, and sharing user experiences.\n\nAfter Effects creates motion graphics and visual effects for film, TV, video, and web.\n\nAnimate designs interactive vector and bitmap animations for games, apps, and the web, as well as publish content to reach viewers on desktop, mobile, and TV.\n\nAudition allows you to create, mix, and design sound effects.\n\nDreamweaver is a tool to easily design, code, and publish websites and web applications that look amazing on any screen.\n\nIllustrator creates precise designs, illustrations, and vector graphics on desktop and iPad.\n\nInCopy helps writers and editor style text, track changes, and make simple layout modifications while designers work on the same document in InDesign, all without disrupting workflows.\n\nInDesign focuses on print and digital media, specifically with designing pages and layouts.\n\nLightroom is used to edit, organize, store, and share photos from anywhere\n\nPhotoshop is designed to help create graphics, photos, and art on desktop and iPad. This subscription comes with Adobe Fresco for drawing and painting.\n\nPremiere Pro allows you to professionally edit videos and film.\n\nSubstance 3D is a collection of 6 applications to create models, design materials, texture assets, and render scenes. These 6 applications consist of Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Adobe Substance 3D Stager, Adobe Substance 3D Designer, Adobe Substance 3D Sampler, Adobe Substance 3D Modeler, and Adobe Substance 3D Assets.\n\nAdobe Acrobat Pro DC With E-Sign (Teams Subscription Only)\n\nThe other way you can use your Adobe credit is to pay for an annual prepaid subscription to Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams.\n\nWe would argue that this is actually the more productive way to use your $150 Adobe credit. That\u2019s because it requires a much smaller annual commitment and offers some useful tools that your business can likely use.\n\nCurrently, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC now includes e-sign capabilities, so the subscription you\u2019ll want to look for is Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams, which starts at $287.88 per year per license for an annual prepaid plan.\n\nFactoring in the $150 Adobe credit means you\u2019re saving more than 50% on your subscription cost.\n\nWhile Acrobat Pro is included in the Creative Cloud subscription above, this particular subscription plan probably makes more sense to you if your business doesn\u2019t necessarily have a need for creative software for video production, photo editing, and more.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a business that regularly creates PDFs and documents that require signatures, you may benefit enormously from Acrobat Pro.\n\nSome of the most popular features of Acrobat Pro include:\n\nSign and collect unlimited signatures\n\nMicrosoft 365 integration\n\nExport, convert, and edit PDFs (directly in the PDF)\n\nCollect e-signatures from websites\n\nAdd custom branding\n\nCreate searchable, editable PDFs\n\nCompare PDFs and permanently redact information\n\n\u2026 and the list goes on!\n\nPlus, your Acrobat Pro subscription comes with desktop, web, and mobile access, as well as 100GB of cloud storage.\n\nSecuring the Amex Business Platinum Card\n\nELEVATED OFFER Terms Apply / Rates & Fees The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express U.P.

This works well in conjunction with real-time content testing and quickly optimizing a website depending on what part of it is getting the most visitors. In addition to live data coming in from the web, Analytics will now also be able to collect and display real-time data from Social, Target and Media Optimizer (Adobe Campaign has yet to be integrated into the mix.)\n\nPredictive Analytics: Adobe has also added a predictive element to Analytics which helps marketers anticipate the actions a site visitor or customer will take based on their previous behavior. Analytics builds up a data repository of a customer profile based on their interactions across all digital channels (as well as third party data from a platform such as BlueKai.) These sort of predictive analytics based on behavior were being done earlier by a platform called Resonate, but Adobe has the added advantage of being able to tie it into customer profiles based on demographics as well, giving a larger variety of segments to target.\n\nUnified Segment Builder: With the added influx of data from all the different digital channels, Analytics can now be used to build a specific audience segment with up-to-date information. This is fed into a Master Marketing Profile, an new Adobe service launched last month that presents a single view of a customer to be shared across all the other marketing channels for a unified campaign.\n\nMobile Analytics: Introduced for measure engagement and download stats for any apps marketers develop for a campaign or just as another digital channel.\n\nApple iBeacon Support: Allows marketers to deliver and measure personalized content to customers in a live event setting.\n\nIn addition to new features for Analytics, Adobe also had a few new updates for Media Optimizer, its platform for coordinating paid and programmatic ad buying across multiple channels:\n\nPredictive modeling: Algorithms to predict campaign performance and ROI across different media channels. This enables marketers to optimize their campaigns and figure out which media mix will produce the most returns.\n\nUnified Campaign Analysis: Tighter integration with Adobe Analytics means marketers can see a broad view of engagement stats, from website metrics to search engine advertising performance.\n\nReal-time Campaign Management: With the addition of the real-time data stream in Analytics, marketers can change their campaigns and media mixes on the fly, reacting to the real-time information coming in.\n\nRetail Advertising Optimization: The ability to manage display advertising and retail campaigns from a single, optimized feed.",

            "content": "Technology has been one of the worst-performing sectors in 2025, led by a sell-off in megacap behemoths like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But Adobe (ADBE 1.14%) has held up well and is up slightly year to date at the time of this writing.\n\nHere's why Adobe has a lot to prove on March 12 -- when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 results and likely updates its full-year guidance -- and whether this growth stock is worth buying now.\n\nAdobe is coming off a brutal sell-off in 2024\n\nAs mentioned, Adobe is holding up better than other megacap tech stocks so far this year.\n\nHowever, it was one of the worst-performing tech stocks in 2024 -- losing over 25% of its value despite a 20.8% gain in the sector.\n\nAdobe has developed exciting new artificial intelligence (AI) software solutions but hasn't provided a clear road map for AI monetization in the same way as other software giants like Salesforce.\n\nAdobe isn't delivering on investor expectations\n\nTo its credit, the company has innovated rapidly with new generative AI tools for images, vectors, designs, and videos; subscription add-ons with AI assistants; AI-embedded editing applications, and more. But the forecast for how these developments will impact the bottom line is cloudy at best.\n\nThe midpoints of fiscal 2025 guidance are $23.43 billion in revenue and $20.35 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which would imply just 8.9% year-over-year revenue growth and 10.5% adjusted EPS growth. Adjusted numbers leave out certain accounting measures like stock-based compensation, which can provide a more accurate reading on business operations. But figures based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are better for looking at pure profit.\n\nThe key takeaway is that Adobe's forecast growth rate for fiscal 2025 is fairly weak for a company developing cutting-edge AI solutions. And to make matters worse, its revenue and earnings had already been growing slower than historical rates.\n\nSluggish growth\n\nOver the last few years, the company has been growing annual sales in the low double digits and earnings in the low to mid double digits. Fiscal 2025's projections would mark the lowest annual revenue increase and nearly the lowest earnings growth in a decade.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Projections Revenue $5.85 billion $7.3 billion $9.03 billion $11.17 billion $12.87 billion $15.79 billion $17.61 billion $19.41 billion $21.51 billion $23.43 billion Revenue (YoY growth) 21.9% 24.8% 23.7% 23.7% 15.2% 22.7% 11.5% 11.4% 10.8% 8.9% Adjusted EPS $3.01 $4.31 $6.76 $7.87 $10.10 $12.48 $13.71 $16.07 $18.42 $20.35 Adjusted EPS (YoY growth) 44.7% 43.2% 56.8% 16.4% 28.3% 23.6% 9.9% 17.2% 14.6% 10.5%\n\nAdobe ramped up expenses, including research and development, to build its new AI tools. A slowdown in earnings, at least for a while, was understandable. But we are entering what is effectively the third year of the company's AI rollout. Instead of proving to investors that the technology is a growth catalyst, the business is showing a deceleration in sales and earnings growth.\n\nWith the numbers moving in the opposite direction, investors may be wondering if AI will be a net positive for the company. And even if it improves Adobe's product suite, what if its competitors leverage AI more effectively and then undercut Adobe on price?\n\nOn the December earnings call, management discussed its growth algorithm and why the company is more focused on attracting new users and measuring engagement with its AI tools rather than price increases. But as last year's downward pressure on the stock price showed, patience has run out for the AI experiment.\n\nA few positives worth considering\n\nDespite the lackluster results in recent years, the company does have a few key things going for it. Adobe has set the bar low for fiscal 2025 by providing what was largely received as weak guidance.\n\nThe company is still growing, just at a slower pace. It remains a high-margin business that generates a ton of free cash flow and more than offsets stock-based compensation with stock buybacks (the share count has decreased 9.7% in the last five years).\n\nThe stock's valuation is reasonable. Based on adjusted fiscal 2025 EPS of $20.35, it has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.9. On a GAAP basis, even the midpoint EPS of $15.95 would give it a forward P/E of 28, which isn't terribly overpriced.\n\nAdobe has been an underwhelming AI play so far, but because the stock sold off so much last year and earnings continue to grow, the valuation has reached the point where the stock can be considered a worthwhile long-term buy.\n\nAdobe is a balanced buy for patient investors\n\nAdobe is worth a closer look for investors who like its fundamentally sound business and who believe AI will be a net positive for the company. Since the valuation is low, it doesn't have to deliver lights-out earnings growth. But it must prove that AI can be a competitive advantage rather than a deterrent.\n\nIf Adobe flips a switch and delivers a clear and concise path to faster AI-fueled growth, the stock could become too cheap to ignore.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC) and Adobe Inc. (ADBE), as well as two micro-cap stocks Friedman Industries, Inc. (FRD) and NetSol Technologies, Inc. (NTWK). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\n\nWalmart\u2019s emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\n\nHowever, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\nShares of HSBC have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+68.4% vs. +25.6%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter results reflected lower expenses. A strong capital position, relatively high rates, global network and business simplification efforts will keep aiding its financials.\n\nAs part of its Asia pivot strategy, it is moving away from less profitable markets and announced the sale of businesses in Germany and South Africa. It has exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia.\n\nWhile efforts to strengthen its market share in the Asia region will support financials, they will likely lead to an increase in expenses. For 2025, the company expects operating expenses to increase 3%. The company\u2019s subdued revenue performance in light of weaker loan demand amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop is a woe.\n\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\n\nAdobe\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-19.4% vs. +1.4%). The company is facing intensifying competition from the likes of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is concerning. Lack of monetization is a headwind for Adobe amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nNevertheless, Adobe\u2019s prospects are expected to benefit from strong demand for its creative products. Its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products have been driving top-line growth. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly Services, DX premium tiers and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products.\n\nThese are expected to drive Adobe\u2019s market share and monetization in the near future. Adobe\u2019s deepening generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) focus and innovative GenAI-powered portfolio are key catalysts.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Adobe here >>>)\n\nShares of Friedman Industries have underperformed the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry over the past year (-12.4% vs. +24.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $110.07 million is facing fiscal third-quarter sales declined 18.9% year over year. The tubular segment remains weak and high inventory levels pose risks amid steel price volatility. Rising costs and debt burdens could pressure profitability despite hedging strategies and operational efficiencies.\n\nNevertheless, Friedman Industries' sales backlog grew 11% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025, signaling stronger demand and potential revenue recovery. Post-election stability has driven increased order activity, with fiscal fourth-quarter sales and margin expansion expected as hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices rebound.\n\nDebt fell 9% to $32.5 million, with $99.2 million in available credit supporting operations. Industry tailwinds include a projected increase in HRC prices and rising infrastructure and manufacturing investments.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Friedman Industries here >>>)\n\nNetSol Technologies\u2019 shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-14.2% vs. +1.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $28.48 million have seen license fee revenues plummeted 97.6% year over year, and rising operating expenses ($7.41 million, +20.5%) pressured profitability. Net loss reached $1.15 million due to FX volatility, and revenue from key client Daimler fell 23%.\n\nTrade risks, competitive pressures, and uncertain ROI on growth investments remain concerns. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, NetSol is transitioning to a subscription-based model, enhancing revenue stability. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription and support revenues grew 27% year over year to $8.6 million (55.6% of total revenues).\n\nStrong customer relationships with BMW and Kubota drive long-term revenue visibility, while North American expansion diversifies income streams. AI-driven product enhancements improve efficiency, and a solid cash position ($21.3 million) supports growth.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NetSol Technologies here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corp.

            "content": "Photoshop is in trouble. Attacked on all sides by the best photo editing apps with powerful image editing features \u2013 Canva and Instagram chief among them \u2013 the pressure has been on to deliver a Photoshop mobile app deserving of the name.\n\nLest we forget, Photoshop celebrated its 35th birthday earlier this year, making it one of a very small number of brands to have simultaneously become an enduring household name even as the tectonic plates of content production have shifted dramatically beneath it.\n\nAnd so, finally, the new Photoshop for iPhone is here. A free app \u2013 albeit one improved by the presence of a paid-for Creative Cloud account), Adobe makes some big claims. It delivers Photoshop\u2019s core imaging and design tools as well as some surprisingly powerful pro features, layer masking and blending among them, as well as the generative AI features that are making a splash on the desktop version.\n\nSo, as someone who opens Photoshop on a near-daily basis for commercial photography, here\u2019s how the new Photoshop for iPhone tickles my fancy after hours of tinkering and prodding...\n\nPhotoshop for iPhone: The likes\n\n1. It's easy to learn\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nI\u2019ll never admit it, but I don\u2019t know everything about Photoshop. And in an app that can\u2019t offer the usual tooltips when you hover over an unfamiliar icon, Photoshop for iPhone has am slight learning curve, even if you understand the core terminology and principles.\n\nThank goodness, then, for the dozen or so video tutorials you can access when you first open the app. These take the form of talking-head videos describing various actions, such as working with layers, masks and selections, as well as videos provided by creators as they describe their process to building various collages and concepts.\n\nOf these, the latter are particularly useful as they come with the source files, allowing you to see how a final image comes to be \u2013 useful if you don\u2019t a file of your own to hand.\n\n2. All the core features are there\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nBlimey. A quick feel around Photoshop for iPhone\u2019s clean-looking interface reveals a really full set of tools. There are no fire-and-forget filters here \u2013 if you want to apply a split-tone look to an image, you\u2019re going to have to get up to your elbows in hue and saturation sliders.\n\nThat\u2019s a book of two chapters, of course \u2013 on the one hand it takes longer, and more practice, to get the effect you want. On the other, all those years I\u2019ve spent laboriously learning how to do things in Photoshop translate like-to-like.\n\n3. It can handle some surprisingly big files and tasks\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nAlthough Adobe is careful not to claim that Photoshop for iPhone has brought over every tool in the Photoshop chest, the app makes it clear \u2013 this is for ambitious types.\n\nSo, obviously, I fired a 1GB file over AirDrop to try and bring the whole thing to its knees. Just to make sure it didn\u2019t work, and thus give me something to complain about, the file was a high-res, TIFF-format image in the ProPhoto colorspace. To my immense surprise, the file promptly loaded and looked\u2026 fine.\n\nAs we\u2019ll come to in a bit, not everything makes the journey betwixt Photoshop desktop and Photoshop for iPhone, but if you\u2019ve got big images, captured on modern cameras, you\u2019ll be able to bring work-in-progress onto your iPhone to work on them.\n\nAnd, not only is it compatible with layers \u2013 finally \u2013 it\u2019s also compatible with layer groups, which means you can work up some surprisingly complex image constructions using the same device you use to watch TikToks on the toilet.\n\n4. It's got Adobe Camera Raw\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nThis is another big one \u2013 import a raw file into the iPhone for Photoshop app and you\u2019ll be greeted with a different-looking-but-still-all-there version of Adobe Camera Raw, allowing you to prepare a file for further editing via a surprisingly full set of options.\n\nHighlights, shadows, whites and blacks all get their own sliders, as does color balance, complete with its own white balance picker. Texture, clarity, dehaze and vignette control are all there, as is a one-tap lens corrections button.\n\nOnce you\u2019re finished, you can finish importing your image either as a standard layer or, get this, as a smart object, letting you step back into ACR if you want to fine tune things further.\n\n5. Generative fill has made it, which is\u2026 good?\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nGetting images share-ready just got faster, thanks to Adobe\u2019s much-vaunted Generative AI features that also make an appearance in the new Photoshop app.\n\nLean on Photoshop for iPhone\u2019s automated features and you\u2019re in for an impressive experience \u2013 the app was uncannily good at automatically detecting and selecting foregrounds, backgrounds, people and skies. And with the annoying legwork of making selections turned into a one-tap process, removing and replacing objects from your work is equally quick.\n\nI found generative AI \u2013 replacing skies and such, removing the odd person \u2013 to work as well on iPhone as it does on the desktop \u2013 which is to say, impressive, with occasionally hilarious outtakes.\n\nPhotoshop for iPhone: the dislikes\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nIt strikes me as strange that an app which prides itself on being the fullest-fledged version of Photoshop that Adobe could manage is missing a few tools which, least for this snapper, are part of my daily arsenal.\n\nFor example, I think it\u2019s impressive that Photoshop for iPhone can open a multi-layered, 1GB TIFF file with a load of adjustment layers, but less impressive that when some of those adjustment layers are levels adjustments, there\u2019s no way of editing them. It seems strange \u2013 curves has made it, so why not levels?\n\nAnd although Photoshop for iPhone does a generally decent job of automatically selecting objects, things are a bit trickier if you want to make your selections freehand, as there\u2019s no paths tool. Not only no paths tool, but if an image has paths already in it, there\u2019s no way of accessing them within the app.\n\nYou could make the very sensible argument that creating a spot-on bezier curve is hard enough with a mouse or trackpad, of course, and that trying to perfect a bendy path with a fingertip would be a surefire track to PTSD, but it would be nice as an inclusion.\n\nWhile I'm here, Photoshop\u2019s handy collection of filters are also missing, so if you were looking for a chance to learn, for example, frequency separation, you\u2019ll need to stick with your desktop.\n\n2. It's free, but only just\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / Future)\n\nReal talk: getting an app with the power that Photoshop for iPhone has and then grousing that it costs money is like getting breakfast cooked for you by a Michelin starred chef and then complaining about the language \u2013 this is an incredibly powerful app that produces near-desktop results from a device that fits in your pocket.\n\nIf you\u2019re a high-end content creator, or want to tip-tap away at an image before transferring it seamlessly to your desktop, Photoshop for iPhone just set a new standard.\n\nStill, if you want the full version \u2013 which includes omissions from the free version including generative fill (the free version gives you 10 free generative credits, the paid-for one 100), object select, the magic wand tool and a few others, you\u2019ll need to stump up $69.99 / \u00a369.99 a year.\n\nDon\u2019t sniff \u2013 that\u2019s cheaper than Canva, and while Canva is undoubtedly the better tool for whizzing up social media templates, for photographers there\u2019s no contest. And bear in mind \u2013 if you already have a Creative Cloud subscription, this is included for free.\n\n3. It's not on Android yet\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t actually care about this one as I'm on iPhone, but if you\u2019re in the 70% of the smartphone market that uses Android, you might.\n\nWhile it\u2019s (probably) more efficient to develop an app for Apple\u2019s closed system of app stores and hardware, there will be plenty of content creators out there screaming for a decent image editor, and Adobe hasn\u2019t done them a favor here.\n\nStill, Adobe has promised that an Android version is coming \"later this year\", so Android fans shouldn't have to wait too much longer for it.",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\n\n\n\nWalmart\u2019s emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\n\n\n\nHowever, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of HSBC have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+68.4% vs. +25.6%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter results reflected lower expenses. A strong capital position, relatively high rates, global network and business simplification efforts will keep aiding its financials.\n\n\n\nAs part of its Asia pivot strategy, it is moving away from less profitable markets and announced the sale of businesses in Germany and South Africa. It has exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia.\n\n\n\nWhile efforts to strengthen its market share in the Asia region will support financials, they will likely lead to an increase in expenses. For 2025, the company expects operating expenses to increase 3%. The company\u2019s subdued revenue performance in light of weaker loan demand amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop is a woe.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\n\n\n\nAdobe\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-19.4% vs. +1.4%). The company is facing intensifying competition from the likes of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is concerning. Lack of monetization is a headwind for Adobe amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Adobe\u2019s prospects are expected to benefit from strong demand for its creative products. Its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products have been driving top-line growth. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly Services, DX premium tiers and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products.\n\n\n\nThese are expected to drive Adobe\u2019s market share and monetization in the near future. Adobe\u2019s deepening generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) focus and innovative GenAI-powered portfolio are key catalysts.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Adobe here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Friedman Industries have underperformed the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry over the past year (-12.4% vs. +24.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $110.07 million is facing fiscal third-quarter sales declined 18.9% year over year. The tubular segment remains weak and high inventory levels pose risks amid steel price volatility. Rising costs and debt burdens could pressure profitability despite hedging strategies and operational efficiencies.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Friedman Industries' sales backlog grew 11% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025, signaling stronger demand and potential revenue recovery. Post-election stability has driven increased order activity, with fiscal fourth-quarter sales and margin expansion expected as hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices rebound.\n\n\n\nDebt fell 9% to $32.5 million, with $99.2 million in available credit supporting operations. Industry tailwinds include a projected increase in HRC prices and rising infrastructure and manufacturing investments.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Friedman Industries here >>>)\n\n\n\nNetSol Technologies\u2019 shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-14.2% vs. +1.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $28.48 million have seen license fee revenues plummeted 97.6% year over year, and rising operating expenses ($7.41 million, +20.5%) pressured profitability. Net loss reached $1.15 million due to FX volatility, and revenue from key client Daimler fell 23%.\n\n\n\nTrade risks, competitive pressures, and uncertain ROI on growth investments remain concerns. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, NetSol is transitioning to a subscription-based model, enhancing revenue stability. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription and support revenues grew 27% year over year to $8.6 million (55.6% of total revenues).\n\n\n\nStrong customer relationships with BMW and Kubota drive long-term revenue visibility, while North American expansion diversifies income streams.

            "content": "TransPerfect's recent integration of its GlobalLink solution with Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) highlights a significant development for Adobe, which aims to enhance its marketing tools by incorporating AI-powered translation technologies. This, among other recent announcements such as the launch of Adobe Firefly and improved data collaboration features in Adobe's Real-Time CDP, reflects the company's active pursuit of innovation to improve customer experiences. Adobe's share price rose 2.88% over the last month, a period marked by volatility in tech stocks as the Nasdaq faced a 1.1% decline amidst broader tech sell-offs related to tariff concerns. Despite this challenging market backdrop, Adobe's strategic focus on innovation may have helped sustain its shareholder returns. These developments, coupled with an overall market trend where even tech-heavy indices were impacted by tariffs and inflation jitters, illustrate the company's resilience in navigating a complex economic landscape.\n\nNavigate through the intricacies of Adobe with our comprehensive report here.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nAdobe's shares have delivered a total return of 43.15% over the past five years. This performance occurs against a backdrop of strategic initiatives and key developments that have helped shape the company's trajectory. One significant event was Adobe's consistent earnings growth, with earnings rising by 6% annually over this period. This steady growth was supported by strong performances in several quarters, such as the revenue increase reported in December 2024, where income grew to US$5.61 billion. Another key factor was Adobe's proactive share repurchasing program, which bolstered shareholder returns. Notable buybacks included repurchases worth US$1.61 billion by December 2024.\n\nIn the realm of innovation, Adobe has been active with product launches such as Adobe Firefly, which contributed to enhancing its Creative Cloud offerings. The company also forged important partnerships, like the collaboration with Amazon Web Services in January 2025, expanding Adobe's Experience Platform capabilities. However, despite these efforts, Adobe's recent one-year return underperformed both the US market, which returned 14%, and the software industry, which saw an 8% return. The company's focus on value creation through these strategic initiatives reflects its commitment to navigating and capitalizing on market changes.",

The associated price target was lowered to $600.00.\n\nMichael Turrin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors including Adobe\u2019s promising start to the year in both its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments. The company has shown strong performance, particularly with products like GenStudio, CDP, and Journey Analytics, which have demonstrated elevated activity levels. Additionally, Adobe\u2019s strategic positioning for the upcoming Summit conference is expected to be a significant catalyst, as it will likely highlight advancements in Firefly and other AI-driven features.\n\nFurthermore, the valuation of Adobe shares appears attractive, trading below their historical averages, which suggests potential for growth. Turrin\u2019s price target for Adobe is set at $600, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on multiple AI-enabled product cycles. This outlook is supported by Adobe\u2019s robust market position and anticipated product developments, which are expected to drive further investor interest and revenue growth.\n\nTurrin covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Microsoft, Atlassian, and Adobe. According to TipRanks, Turrin has an average return of -1.6% and a 46.49% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released on March 5, Piper Sandler also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $600.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

But analysts were quick to talk about the breakout number on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nShantanu Narayen, Adobe's CEO, said on the call that the company expects to double its AI ARR by the end of the financial year.\n\n\"Whether it is innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it,\" Narayen said on the call.\n\nThe company said it expects revenue to increase to between $5.77 billion and $5.82 billion in the second quarter.\n\nAdobe's stock dipped 4.5% in after-hours trading, extending a rough year that has seen shares slide 23%, even as the S&P 500 climbed 8%.\n\nAs AI spending surges, investors are watching closely to see if tech companies can turn big bets into real returns.\n\nNarayen said on the earnings call that future info on AI's ARR would be released \"periodically\" \u2014 not quarterly.\n\nIn a research note ahead of earnings, Gregg Moskowitz, a managing director at Mizuho, wrote, \"Adobe is unquestionably a frustrating stock in 2024.\"\n\nHe wrote that analysts remain optimistic that Adobe would successfully monetize its generative AI offerings and see strong growth in ARR and revenue guidance for the financial year.\n\nEquity analysts from Jefferies said in a report published on Sunday that chief information officers they surveyed expect their companies' spend on Adobe's creative software to accelerate in 2025.\n\nThe surveys included 15 chief information officers and 40 end users. The report said that Adobe's AI offerings are \"competitive\" and that \"fears of AI reducing the need for Adobe may be overblown.\"\n\nOf end users surveyed, 65% told Jefferies their use of Adobe's creative software would increase within the next three years, while 50% evaluated Adobe's AI offerings \"as better than competitors.\"\n\nAdobe did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

My team and I put the top tools to the test, and these are my recommendations for beginner and professional photographers.\n\nI still recommend CyberLink PhotoDirector for most people looking for the best alternative to Lightroom. It's seriously easy to use - especially if you know your way around Lightroom - and offers good value for money in comparison. It's also one of the best photo editors and best Adobe Photoshop alternatives we've tested.\n\nCheck out the full reviews below - with each app extensively tested and reviewed, comparing them against Lightroom's own features, interface, and performance to see which ones match and exceed Adobe's own photo organizer tool.\n\nYou can also see our full thoughts of Adobe's software in our Lightroom review.\n\nThe best Adobe Lightroom alternatives of 2025\n\nBest Lightroom alternative overall\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best.

Adobe Lightroom is a powerful image organizer and editor, but it\u2019s not amongst the cheapest.\n\nIf you bundle Lightroom with Photoshop, you'll be spending at least $20 per month, whereas CyberLink will only cost you $40 for the year, and our experts find that they offer similar features. Alternatively, you can grab a perpetual license for only $100, which is something Adobe hasn\u2019t offered its professional customers in a long long while.\n\nIn addition to having a well-designed interface to organize your shots, and perform basic to advanced image editing, PhotoDirector also lets you composite an image, working with multiple layers, letting you add text boxes, and perform various actions like removing the background or tweaking facial features. On top of that, it offers a slew of generative AI tools, just like Adobe Firefly.\n\nRead our full CyberLink PhotoDirector 365 review\n\nBest Lightroom alternative for beginners\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nSkylum Luminar has been popular as a RAW photo editor for years, but in 2018, it added digital asset management capabilities, making it one of the best Lightroom alternatives out there.\n\nSince then, other image enhancement filters powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have been added, which our team think has made Skylum Luminar a genuine rival to Lightroom. For example, Accent AI will analyze a photo to automatically calculate the best edits to make.\n\nIf you're an amateur editor looking for a suitable alternative for Lightroom, these tools will prove useful. There is also quite a large focus on presets and one-click edits, which will help you become familiar with the program. More experienced users aren\u2019t left out, however, as advanced editing tools are available for those who like finer-grained control.\n\nThe pricing for Skylum Luminar is modest at around $200 for a one-time license or you can choose a monthly subscription of around $9 for the Explore plan, or around $12 for the Pro plan. However, there's no free trial but there is a 30-day money-back guarantee. Skylum Luminar is available as both a standalone app and a plugin for other apps like Lightroom, Photoshop, and Photos for macOS.\n\nRead our full Luminar Neo review\n\nBest Lightroom alternative and Photoshop alternative\n\n(Image credit: ON1)\n\n3. ON1 Photo RAW A RAW photo editor and organizer Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Combination of Lightroom and Photoshop features + One-time fee + 14-day free trial + 90-day money-back guarantee Reasons to avoid - Catalog backup not as easy as Lightroom\n\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with using Adobe tools to manage and edit your photos, our team found ON1 Photo RAW a breeze.\n\nAs an alternative to Lightroom and Photoshop, it\u2019s a powerful combination of both apps. ON1 boasts many of Lightroom\u2019s digital asset management features to keep media libraries in order, plus the sometimes essential image-editing capabilities of Photoshop. It also features layers and focus stacking, so it\u2019s easy to get to grips with if you\u2019re familiar with Adobe products.\n\nThe RAW photo editor and organizer originally started out developing image-editing plugins, many of which are now integrated with Photo RAW. That gives it a strong edge over some of the other best Lightroom alternatives. When using the tool, there\u2019s no need to import images, as the program will automatically recognize images on your computer\u2019s hard drive. Where it falls short is its catalog backup, which lacks Lightroom\u2019s easy touch.\n\nON1 Photo RAW has a decent one-time cost at around $114 / \u00a3104 / AU$170, fully licensed and ideal for the subscription-wary (though one is available). It also comes with a 14-day free trial and a 90-day money-back guarantee.\n\nBest Adobe Lightroom alternative for professionals\n\nCapture One Pro is a photo organizing and editing program designed for professional and studio photographers. With that comes a range of advanced tools.\n\nWe found that the Capture One Pro is a good alternative to Lightroom in its feature set, while including some of the functionality found in Photoshop, like being able to use layers. If you\u2019re always expanding your image library and don\u2019t want to lose track, organizing images can be grouped by sessions, not just catalogs, and you can even add annotations directly onto photos.\n\nBecause Phase One\u2019s history has been with high-end cameras, the software has benefitted from having a similar emphasis on high-end rendering quality. The platform used to be quite expensive because of that focus, but the price has come down to be similar to that of Lightroom.\n\nYou can either pay for a subscription or purchase the software outright. Subscribers get free updates, and outright purchasers can get updates at special prices. You can also get licenses that support just one brand of camera - Sony, Fujifilm, or Nikon - for a reduced fee.\n\nBest Lightroom alternative for RAW conversion\n\nImage 1 of 8\n\nDxO PhotoLab is from DxO, a French company that produces photo editing and organizing software and runs a benchmark service to assess lenses and mobile and digital cameras.\n\nThe image editor, which is available for Mac and PC, converts RAW images and automatically corrects optical flaws, extends dynamic range, and removes digital noise. These features are in the Nik Collection suite of tools, which used to be a Google product.\n\nPhotoLab has always had image-editing capabilities, but it also has photo libraries added for managing images, which we found makes it a contender for the best Lightroom alternative title. Similar to other apps, DxO PhotoLab will efficiently organize images found on your hard drive, rather than requiring you to import them into the program.\n\nThe software can be purchased for a one-time fee, and there is a 30-day free trial.\n\nRead our full DxO Photolab review\n\nBest free Lightroom alternative\n\n(Image credit: RawTherapee)\n\n6. RawTherapee A free alternative with RAW power Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Free + Easy to learn + Familiar interface Reasons to avoid - Limited feature set - No image collections to organize photos\n\nIn our experience, RawTherapee is one of the best free Lightroom alternatives you can find - so long as you're mostly focused on RAW image editing.\n\nIt's an open-source RAW image-processing app, so you\u2019re able to use it across Windows, macOS, and Linux. It\u2019s powerful and accessible enough to attract both beginners and professionals.\n\nIn terms of interface and toolset, it\u2019s something of a hybrid alternative to Lightroom and Photoshop, though it doesn\u2019t have the same level of image management and organization capabilities of either. RawTherapee is best thought of as a sort of lightweight mirror of both tools (and a few other apps), so it doesn\u2019t have the same steep learning curve of either.\n\nWhat sets it apart as one of the best Lightroom alternatives is the non-destructive editing when working with RAW files, it will always keep your files intact. It also has many of the editing tools that you\u2019ll find in Lightroom, like adjusting exposure, sharpening and curves, and color correction.\n\nBest Adobe Lightroom alternatives: FAQs\n\nWhat is Adobe Lightroom? Adobe Lightroom is a photo organization and management tool. Designed for photographers, it features lightweight image editing tools, cataloging, RAW file editing, and more. When we tested out Lightroom, we found it clean, fast and powerful, praising the clarity and freedom of the workspace and some of the best photo cloud storage integration.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom? Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom might seem similar, but there some big differences between the two. Photoshop is the industry-standard photo editing, featuring some of the best graphic design software. It\u2019s used by designers, artists, photographers who need the best digital art and drawing software. Adobe Lightroom is a photo management app strictly for photographers. It\u2019s designed for more efficient workflows when organizing images, while offering minor image editing tools for touching up photos. Which you choose depends on whether you mostly edit or organize photos, or a combination of both. Lightroom and Photoshop are available as standalone apps or as bundled in the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan.\n\nWhat makes a good alternative to Adobe Lightroom? Alternatives to Lightroom should offer excellent photo organization tools - it\u2019s the main reason why photographers use it. They should feature the best cloud storage support possible to maximize productivity - but also just make it easier to find the photos you need. This is one feature we especially liked when we reviewed Lightroom. If they can add more advanced image editing tools, then that\u2019s even better - Lightroom\u2019s own editing capabilities are very powerful but limited in scope. See our guide to the best ways to backup photos.\n\nHow to choose the best Adobe Lightroom alternatives for you\n\nWhen you\u2019re choosing which Adobe Lightroom alternative is best for you, you\u2019ll want to consider:\n\n\u2013 Image manipulation tools\n\n\u2013 Ease of organization\n\n\u2013 Pricing model\n\n\u2013 Cataloging options, especially with an ever-growing library\n\nBut start by considering your skill-level. Lightroom is incredibly easy to master, and if you\u2019re looking for a similarly simple software substitution, you\u2019ll be more at home with a tool like Luminar compared to the more advanced Capture One Pro. As part of this, consider which devices you're running the software on, and whether you'll need the best monitors for photo editing for color accuracy and coverage.\n\nNext, look at how you intend to use the tool. Is it for simple photo organization and management, do you need Photoshop-levels of image editing, or comprehensive photo cataloging options? Not all alternatives to Lightroom are created equal. Depending on your choice, you may want to invest in best laptops for photo editing and best photo editing PCs for a more seamless workflow.\n\nFinally, choose your preferred pricing model - Adobe famously bundles its software in Creative Cloud subscription packages. If you don\u2019t mind subscribing, Capture One Pro is an ideal Lightroom alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019ll find great free options out there, like the open-source RawTherapee, and those that offer one-off purchases, like Skylum Luminar and DxO PhotoLab.\n\nHow we test the best alternatives to Adobe Lightroom\n\nWe've extensively tested a range of substitute Adobe apps across the creative and office suites. This includes the best Premiere Pro alternatives, best InDesign alternatives, and the best Adobe Acrobat alternatives for PDF editing.\n\nWhen reviewing the best Adobe Lightroom alternatives, we\u2019ve focused on what matters most to you: interface, performance, price, and features. We also wanted to see photography taking center-stage through the user experience. After all, that's Lightroom's true user-base, and in comparison, the best Lightroom alternatives must be similarly focused on the photographer and camera.\n\nOur experts have tried each of these tools. In every case, apps were assed to judge closely they mirror the Adobe experience - from user interfaces and learning curves, to advanced capabilities and pricing models.\n\nWhere a Lightroom alternative does something differently, for better or worse, we\u2019ve highlighted those changes, so you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s a good alternative for your creative workflow.",

            "content": "PDF files are ubiquitous in this cross-platform world, making it possible to view and share documents across a range of devices. While simply viewing or commenting on a PDF can be accomplished with free software, there are times when you might need to engage with a PDF document more extensively, such as making edits, reorganizing a file, or working with others to make changes. That\u2019s where a a full-featured PDF editor comes in.\n\nThe best PDF editors allows you to edit, create, alter, and convert PDF files just like you would with any other text document. Adobe Acrobat is the most well-known option for most people. Its reputation is certainly deserved given its excellent feature set and overall utility. But it\u2019s also quite expensive.\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s a whole range of respectable and even great third-party PDF editors that provide less expensive alternatives to Adobe\u2019s premier product.\n\nPROMOTION EaseUS PDF Editor \u2013 Edit, Convert, Compress & Protect PDFs Integrate PDF maker, PDF editor, PDF converter, and PDF reader in one full pack with all the basics you need.

The simple answer is because you get what you pay for. Generally, free online editors will let you add text and comments, merge and split documents, and convert files to and from PDF. With rare exception, however, they won\u2019t let you edit existing text and many have file-size and page-volume restrictions. And a lot of them will watermark your edited document. For these reasons, web PDF editors are best reserved for simple, fast editing jobs. Call in these big dogs for anything more demanding.\n\nWhat to look for in a PDF editor\n\nPDF editors come in a variety of flavors, offering varying feature sets\u2014from basic functionality to power-user tools. It\u2019s important to know what features best match your workflow before you commit to a PDF editor.\n\nCreate, convert, and export PDFs\n\nThe most fundamental function of a PDF editor is to make PDFs, either from scratch, scanned hard copies, or by converting digital documents. A good PDF editor should be able to transform a variety of file types\u2014from Microsoft Office formats to images to HTML\u2014and do so seamlessly, preserving the original formatting. It should also include OCR technology to make the PDF text searchable and editable. Likewise, a good PDF editor must be able to export PDFs into other editable formats such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, HTML, or plain text, maintaining the original files hyperlinks, images, and other elements.\n\nContent editing\n\nAnother bit of magic that PDF editors unlock is the ability to modify text; insert, resize, and move images; and reorganize pages in the PDF. A good one will perform these tasks as easily as in a text document or slide deck, allowing in-line editing, dragging-and dropping graphics, and adding or removing hyperlinks.\n\nReview and annotate\n\nA good PDF editor should also let you or anyone else using it add comments and other annotations to PDF files during review. It should have tools to mark up both text documents and graphic-heavy files like webpages. Common options include sticky notes, callout boxes, highlighting, freehand drawing tools, and stamps with messages like \u201capproved,\u201d \u201crevised,\u201d and \u201cconfidential.\u201d\n\nSecurity\n\nAll businesses deal with documents containing sensitive data. Look for a PDF editor that includes security features that allow access for authorized eyes only. Good options will usually offer several levels of security, including password protection, permissions setting, and content redaction, which \u201cblacks out\u201d selected text and images. Most PDF editors will also offer one or more ways to electronically sign documents.\n\nMobile support\n\nWhile deep PDF editing is best done on a desktop, it\u2019s nice to be able to review and annotate files when you\u2019re out and about. While PDFs can typically be reviewed in any PDF reader or editor, regardless of which one they were created in, consider looking for an editor that has a dedicated mobile app, is optimized for mobile devices, or allows cloud access to features through a mobile browser.\n\nOne of the great things about a PDF is that it can be read and edited in any PDF program regardless of which one it was created in. So beyond the features outlined here, let your personal preferences guide you in making your decision.",

            "content": "Pancreatic Cancer | Image Credit: \u00a9\n\nCrystal light - stock.adobe.com\n\nThe phase 3 COMPETE trial (NCT03049189) met its primary end point of clinically and statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) improvement with non-carrier\u2013added 177 Lutetium edotreotide (177Lu-edotreotide; ITM-11) vs everolimus (Afinitor) in patients with grade 1 or 2 somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\u2013positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).1\n\nTopline data from the trial, which were presented at the 22nd Annual European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society 2025 Conference, showed that the median PFS was 23.9 months with the targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy 177Lu-edotreotide (n = 207) compared with 14.1 months with standard-of-care (SOC) everolimus (n = 102; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.95; P = .022).\n\n\u201cCOMPETE is the first pivotal trial comparing a radiopharmaceutical drug candidate [with] a targeted molecular therapy without the routine use of accompanying somatostatin analogues in this [population of patients with] GEP-NETs,\u201d presenting investigator Jaume Capdevila, MD, PhD, who is also a senior medical oncologist at Vall d\u2019Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, stated in a news release. \u201cThese data show unequivocal support for 177Lu-edotreotide\u2019s potential benefit in extending PFS. Additionally, 177Lu-edotreotide\u2019s convenient dosing schedule and favorable safety results reinforce its potential as a compelling new treatment option.\u201d\n\nThe prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label COMPETE trial enrolled 309 patients with inoperable, progressive, grade 1 or 2 SSTR-positive NETs of pancreatic or gastroenteric origin across Europe, the United States, Australia, and South Africa.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 7.5 GBq of 177Lu-edotreotide with a nephroprotective amino acid solution every 3 months for up to 4 cycles, or everolimus at 10 mg daily for a maximum of 30 months or until disease progression. Patients were stratified by primary tumor origin (gastroenteric NETs vs pancreatic NETs), and by prior lines of medical therapy (1st line vs 2nd line).\n\nPatients were excluded if they had a known hypersensitivity to edotreotide, everolimus, DOTA, lutetium-177, any excipient of edotreotide or everolimus, or any other Rapamycin derivative; prior exposure to any peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; prior exposure to mTOR inhibitors; received prior treatment with external field radiation to GEP-NET lesions within 90 days before randomization or radioembolization therapy; received prior therapy with an investigational compound and/or medical device within 30 days prior to randomization; an indication for potentially curative surgical lesion removal; planned alternative therapy during the study participation period; serious nonmalignant disease; or clinically relevant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or hematological organ dysfunction, that had the potential to interfere with the safety of the study treatments.2\n\nNotably, 177Lu-edotreotide consists of non-carrier\u2013\u00adadded Lutetium-177\u2014which is a therapeutic \u03b2-emitting radioisotope that has a higher isotopic purity than carrier-added lutetium\u2014and the SSTR agonist edotreotide.1177Lu-edotreotide is the first non-carrier\u2013added lutetium radiopharmaceutical to be investigated in patients with GEP-NETs, according to ITM Isotope Technologies, the drug\u2019s developer.\n\nAdditional topline data showed that, as of January 21, 2025, the interim median overall survival (OS) was numerically higher, although not conclusive, for 177Lu-edotreotide compared with everolimus, at 63.4 months vs 58.7 months, respectively (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.5-1.1; P = .206). These OS data will continue to mature. Of note, patients who progressed on study treatment were allowed to initiate an alternative therapy, which may confound the OS data.\n\n\u201cThe COMPETE results represent a major step forward in the development of new treatment options for people living with progressive, inoperable GEP-NETs,\u201d Jonathan Strosberg, MD, past president of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and chair of the GI Research Program at Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida, added in the news release. \u201cBy extending PFS by almost 10 months compared [with] SOC in this trial, 177Lu-edotreotide showed the potential to significantly improve the treatment paradigm for physicians and their patients.\u201d\n\nRegarding safety, the rate of treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) related to study treatment was lower in the 177Lu-edotreotide arm vs the everolimus arm, at 82.5% vs 97.0%, respectively. Notably, 1 serious TEAE of grade 2 myelodysplastic syndrome was reported in the 177Lu-edotreotide arm and deemed related to 177Lu-edotreotide treatment. Overall, no unforeseen TEAS were observed.\n\nAdditional data from the trial, including overall response rate, subgroup analysis findings, quality of life data, and dosimetry, are under evaluation and are planned to be submitted for presentation at future medical conferences. Moreover, ITM Isotope Technologies, the developer of 177Lu-edotreotide, plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in 2025.\n\n\u201cThese successful results validate our decision to design a pivotal phase 3 trial directly comparing a targeted radiopharmaceutical against a targeted molecular therapy in Grade 1/2 GEP-NETS, underscoring our commitment to improving the lives of people living with this challenging cancer,\u201d Andrew Cavey, MD, PhD, chief executive officer of ITM Isotope Technologies, concluded in the news release. \u201cWith this successful readout, 177Lu-edotreotide becomes the first drug candidate in ITM\u2019s broad portfolio of early- to late-stage radiopharmaceuticals to deliver positive phase 3 results and progress towards NDA submission and commercial launch preparations. Together, with our global isotopes manufacturing business, robust supply chain, and experienced clinical and commercial team, we believe we are uniquely positioned as a standout leader in the fast-growing radiopharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Drinking is a ritual, a social connector and a way to unwind. But what we drink and why we drink it? That\u2019s changing fast.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned at Go Brewing is that people aren\u2019t just cutting back on alcohol \u2014 they\u2019re rethinking the role drinks play in their lives. We\u2019re entering a new era, one I like to call hybrid drinking, where consumers are redefining what it means to raise a glass.\n\nGone are the days of rigid categories like \u201calcoholic\u201d or \u201cvirgin.\u201d Instead, we\u2019re seeing a blending of options: craft beverages infused with functional ingredients, non-alcoholic (NA) beers that don\u2019t compromise on flavor and THC drinks that help us feel something without the baggage of alcohol. It\u2019s about creating space for choice \u2014 where the drink fits the person, not the other way around.\n\nWhy Hybrid Drinking? And Why Now?\n\nThe world we live in today feels perpetually \u2018on.\u2019 Social media, deadlines and endless notifications make it hard to slow down. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand \u2014 whether it\u2019s friends canceling plans to recharge or choosing a quiet night in over a big night out, people are finding new ways to carve out moments in different ways. And, it\u2019s no wonder people are looking for something that aligns with a lifestyle of balance and mindfulness. Hybrid drinking gets it. It\u2019s for the person who wants to toast the moment without overdoing it, the one curious about cannabis but unsure where to start or someone looking for a better alternative to sugary, high-energy drinks.\n\nIt\u2019s also a response to shifting social norms. Alcohol has long dominated the beverage space, but younger generations are increasingly turning to alternatives. Gen Z drinks 20 percent less alcohol than Millennials did at the same age. They\u2019re trading shots for seltzers, cocktails for kombucha and beers for beverages that promise something beyond intoxication.\n\nBut what does hybrid drinking even mean? It\u2019s the intentional blending of traditional social rituals with emerging beverage categories that offer new, mindful experiences. It\u2019s about having options that let you drink socially while staying in control \u2014 combining the familiarity of beverages like beer or sparkling water with functional benefits, like relaxation from low-dose THC or a boost from adaptogens. Hybrid drinking is the antithesis of the frat-party keg stand or boozy brunch binge. It\u2019s about making mindful choices that still let you toast to the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nThe Blurring of Categories\n\nWhat makes hybrid drinking exciting is its rejection of traditional boundaries. You don\u2019t have to choose between indulgence and health, fun and function or social connection and self-care.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\nTake the rise of functional beverages \u2014 think adaptogenic sodas, hemp-infused waters or drinks with probiotics and electrolytes. They\u2019ve carved out space where wellness meets pleasure, offering benefits without feeling like a chore.\n\nSimilarly, low-dose THC beverages are entering the mainstream. Unlike traditional cannabis products, they\u2019re designed for approachability. With precise dosing and familiar flavors, they\u2019re less about getting high and more about finding a moment of calm in the chaos.\n\nNA options, once a niche corner of the market, are also thriving. These aren\u2019t the bland, sugary imitations of the past. Today\u2019s NA beers, wines and spirits are crafted with care and complexity, delivering experiences that rival their alcoholic counterparts.\n\nThe other night, I saw a friend casually pair a THC seltzer with an NA IPA. He wasn\u2019t making a statement \u2014 just enjoying his options. That\u2019s the spirit of hybrid drinking: effortless and intentional, blending the best of both worlds. Even menus are evolving, with establishments embracing options that cater to every palate \u2014 from the sober curious to the cannabis connoisseur. Trending Stories Billy Joel Undergoes Surgery, Postpones Four Months of Concerts Trump Officials Are \u2018Pretending\u2019 a Judge Didn\u2019t Bar His Anti-Diversity Orders Tesla Owners Are Desperately Trying to Disguise Their Cars Inside Thom Yorke\u2019s Amazing New Album with Producer Mark Pritchard Related Content\n\nThe Culture Shift\n\nFrom Dry January hashtags to cannabis lounges popping up in major cities, the way we drink is evolving. Hybrid drinking is the next wave in this cultural shift. At its core, hybrid drinking is about intention. It\u2019s not just about what\u2019s in your glass \u2014 it\u2019s about why you\u2019re drinking it. We see this shift across other cultural trends. There\u2019s a move toward conscious consumption in everything from fashion to food, and beverages are no exception. People want their choices to reflect their values, whether that\u2019s prioritizing mental health, supporting sustainability or simply being more present in their daily lives.\n\nAt Go Brewing, we\u2019ve seen firsthand how people are craving options that meet them where they are \u2014 whether that\u2019s a crisp NA beer after work or a micro-dosed THC brew for a laid-back evening. Hybrid drinking isn\u2019t a fad. It\u2019s rewriting the rules of what we drink, when we drink and why. And in doing so, it\u2019s giving us permission to embrace balance. So next time you raise a glass, ask yourself: What fits your moment best? What matches your vibe right now? Odds are, it\u2019s something in between.",

            "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Adobe Systems (ADBE).\n\nAdobe currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.86, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 35 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.86 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 35 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 2.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ADBE\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ADBE\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Adobe here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Adobe, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

Some features may also only be available in certain countries.\n\nTry out Adobe Sensei\n\nThe best AI tools \u2013 ChatGPT, DeepL, Midjourney, and more\n\nWhat is Adobe Sensei?\n\nAdobe's Sensei is an AI platform developed by Adobe to improve productivity, automation, and creative workflows across its software.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Sensei integrates into Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, enhancing tools such as Photoshop, Acrobat, and Adobe\u2019s marketing products.\n\nAre you a pro?

In Photoshop, it assists with intelligent image selections, content-aware fill, and neural filters.\n\nIn Premiere Pro, it enables automated video edits and speech-to-text transcription, while in Document Cloud, it helps process scanned documents with optical character recognition and improves digital signatures in Adobe Sign.\n\nBusinesses using Experience Cloud can benefit from its ability to personalize marketing content and predict customer trends.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nWhat can you use Adobe Sensei for?\n\nAdobe Sensei enables AI-driven automation in several Adobe apps, like Photoshop and Premier Pro, as discussed in the section above.\n\nFor document management, Adobe Acrobat uses Sensei to recognise text in scanned documents, making them editable and searchable, while Adobe Sign applies AI to form field detection and signature verification.\n\nAcross these applications, Sensei aims to save time by automating repetitive tasks and improving the precision of creative and business workflows.\n\nWhat can\u2019t you use Adobe Sensei for?\n\nAdobe Sensei is not available as a standalone AI tool and can only be used within Adobe\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe tool does not generate original images like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E, nor does it function as a chatbot or virtual assistant. While it automates many creative and business processes, it does not fully replace professional editing skills, as manual adjustments are still often required.\n\nAdditionally, its data-driven marketing tools are designed specifically for Adobe software and do not always integrate smoothly with third-party platforms.\n\nHow much does Adobe Sensei cost?\n\nThere is no standalone subscription for Adobe Sensei, as its features are built into Adobe\u2019s software packages.\n\nPricing varies depending on the specific Adobe plan. Creative Cloud apps such as Photoshop and Illustrator start from \u00a39.99 or $9.99 per month per app.\n\nAdobe Document Cloud, which includes Acrobat and Sign, starts from \u00a315.17 or $19.99 per month.\n\nExperience Cloud, aimed at businesses, has custom pricing.\n\nWhere can you use Adobe Sensei?\n\nAdobe Sensei is integrated into Adobe\u2019s desktop apps for Windows and macOS, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and web-based platforms.\n\nIt operates within Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro for creative work, Acrobat and Sign for document automation, and Experience Cloud for marketing and analytics.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nIs Adobe Sensei any good?\n\nAdobe Sensei is a valuable tool for those already using Adobe\u2019s software, providing artificial intelligence-driven automation that speeds up creative and business tasks.\n\nCreative professionals can benefit from AI selection tools, object removal, and content-aware adjustments, while business users save time with automated document processing and intelligent analytics.\n\nIndustry reviewers highlight Sensei\u2019s strengths in automation and precision, particularly in photo editing and workflow management. Some users, however, find its AI features lack customisation options and still require manual oversight.\n\nUse Adobe Sensei if\n\n- Adobe Sensei is most useful for those who already work with Adobe software and want to enhance their workflow with artificial intelligence-driven automation. Creative professionals who regularly edit photos, videos, or graphics will benefit from its ability to refine selections, remove objects, and adjust content intelligently.\n\n- Businesses handling large volumes of documents can use Sensei\u2019s text recognition and digital signature automation to speed up processing. Marketing professionals looking to personalise customer engagement and automate content creation will also find Sensei valuable within Adobe Experience Cloud.\n\nDon\u2019t use Adobe Sensei if\n\n- Adobe Sensei is not suitable for those looking for an artificial intelligence tool that works independently of Adobe software. It is deeply embedded within the Adobe ecosystem, meaning users who do not already rely on Adobe products may find little benefit.\n\n- Sensei is also not ideal for those looking to generate entirely new images or artwork, as its focus is on enhancement rather than creation.\n\nAlso consider\n\nFor those seeking an alternative to Adobe Sensei, there are several options available. Canva Magic Studio offers artificial intelligence-powered design tools for quick and easy content creation, particularly for non-professionals.\n\nRunway provides advanced AI video editing and content generation tools, while Microsoft Copilot is a strong alternative for businesses that require artificial intelligence-powered automation within productivity applications such as Word and Excel.",

            "content": "Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has lost 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.03 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Adobe, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.65 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.45 billion and $25.78 billion estimates indicate +9% and +10% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAdobe reported revenues of $5.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $4.81 for the same period compares with $4.27 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.22%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAdobe is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Documentary Festival, also known as CPH:DOX.\n\nOver the course of nearly a decade, the documentary follows a religious community in the Siberian taiga. Their leader, Sergei Torop, a former traffic officer who now calls himself Vissarion, claims he is the reincarnation of Jesus. Since the 1990s, his followers have been building a settlement, the Abode of Dawn, on a remote mountain.\n\nVissarion himself stays at the edge of the narrative. Like planets around the sun, the lives of these people rotate around Vissarion, although they rarely ever meet him. The film focuses on the villages surrounding the Abode of Dawn, where most of his followers live.\n\nShtubert says: \u201cThe subject of the film is an ambivalent phenomenon and it describes it in an ambivalent way. I did not intend to push any point of view onto the audience. I neither glorify nor destroy what I show. The film shows the strengths and weaknesses of a utopia.

            "content": "Everyone knows and loves (sure) Adobe, the omnipresent provider of everything from the venerable Acrobat Reader to Photoshop and other expensive applications in its desktop publishing Creative Cloud, and more latterly its Experience Suite for marketing automation. But not everyone gets to go to Adobe Summit 2025, scheduled for March 18-20 in Las Vegas, which is why TechDay is going for you.\n\nBilled as the 'Digital Experience Conference', Summit is a gathering of creative, marketing, and technology professionals which, as one might imagine, should result in spectacular hyperbole. On the agenda are look-ins from various perspectives pm Adobe's advancements in consumer tools, desktop software, and marketing automation.\n\nBut with AI taking the world by storm, that's probably going to be the key focus \u2013 confirmed by Adobe's spokesperson in an informal chat with TechDay, They also noted that while most folks know Adobe's 'deskside' products (yep, Photoshop, etc), marketing automation powered by generative AI, delivering personalisation, and data-driven strategies, will be front and centre.\n\nFor those who haven't had the pleasure of attending the conferences of major American vendors, these things are on a spectacular scale and Adobe Summit is no exception. Up to 12 thousand attendees are expected, including a fair few from Australia and New Zealand, who'll be hoping the updates are worth the jet lag and the 3 a.m. Zoom calls back into the office. There's a reason these things take place in playgrounds like Vegas, too. Distraction is part and parcel of the experience.\n\nWhat's on the Agenda?\n\nAdobe Summit 2025 offers more than 200 sessions and hands-on labs across 13 tracks. For the consumer and desktop crowd, the spotlight's likely to fall on the recent Photoshop for mobile release, giving insufferable social media addicts yet another tool to hone their craft. Picture the creative or influencer editing a Bondi Beach sunset while standing on it.\n\nIntegrated with Creative Cloud staples like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, the mobile tool draws on Adobe's Firefly AI for tricks like instant kangaroo removal or adding a Ta Moko without the pain.\n\nOn the marketing automation side, Adobe Experience Cloud (which includes Adobe Analytics, Journey Optimizer, and Real-Time CDP) is expected to showcase AI-driven mass personalisation and workflow optimisation. The new Experience Platform AI Assistant might even help marketers Down Under figure out why \"G'day Mate\" campaigns keep landing in spam. These tools aim to unify data and content, a potential godsend for businesses juggling privacy laws stricter than a Sydney bouncer.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe Summit's a big deal globally, but for Australia and New Zealand, it's a mixed bag of opportunity and eye-rolling. Photoshop for mobile could be a game-changer for freelance creatives in Melbourne's laneways or Wellington's windy streets, letting them tweak designs between flat whites and smashed avo on toast.\n\nAdobe's AI push, via GenStudio and Firefly, promises the answer to allowing apparently increasingly superfluous humans to focus on the soul, while it handles the admin and configuration challenges for campaigns at scale.\n\nBut as intimated in the intro, creatives are given to excess. As are technology folks- there's a reason Gartner named its Hype Cycle the 'Hype Cycle'. In taking a nosy at the goings on at Adobe Summit, TechDay will look to separate the wheat from the chaff and gain ANZ-perspectives for your insight.\n\nAnalyst Insights and Stock Performance\n\nAnalysts see Adobe's AI bets as a winner. Gartner calls it \"a frontrunner in digital transformation,\" while Morgan Stanley predicts growth despite the Figma saga (essentially a 'complicated' and ultimately doomed acquisition kicked off in 2022). Adobe's stock (ADBE) sits at $570 as of March 6, 2025, up 9% year-over-year, with Q1 FY23 revenue at $4.66 billion.",

This command will make a new sequence based on the IN to OUT points that are set in the current timeline. Mark an IN to OUT point on whatever materials you want in the new subsequence, and then choose Sequence > Make Subsequence from the menu.\n\nBetter yet, learn the keyboard shortcuts \u2013 that makes the creation of sub-sequences much faster.\n\nA few notes about subsequences:\n\nA newly created Subsequence will include all of the tracks in the current timeline, but it will only include the media on whatever tracks are toggled on when the command is executed.\n\nIf you use the unmapped Make Subsequence From All Tracks command, then all the media on every track will be included regardless of track toggles.\n\nWhen executing the Make Subsequence command, they will be placed in the last selected bin in your project panel. When you make a subsequence, if you have a closed bin selected while you\u2019re in List View, Premiere will twirl the contents down so you can see the new subsequence that will be selected after creation.\n\nCreating a S ubsequence automatically adds a suffix to the new timeline, which will increment as you create new ones.\n\nThis series is courtesy of Adobe.",

            "content": "With the new administration in place, there has been an array of supply chain-related news and headlines. Here are three things to watch in freight, according to experts at U.S. Bank.\n\n1. U.S. ports cap off 2024 with record container volumes\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles recorded a 24% volume increase from a year earlier in December. On a yearly basis the port reported a nearly 20% increase over 2023, which was the second-best year in the port\u2019s history. Much of the December boost was due to retailers frontloading shipments to get ahead announced or potential tariffs. Other ports reporting double-digit YoY increases included Long Beach (21.3%), Seattle-Tacoma (15.8%) and the Georgia Ports, up 20.6% from a year ago.\n\n2. Homebuilding could get more expensive\n\nPlanned tariffs on the nation\u2019s closest trading partners could threaten to raise U.S. home construction costs. The proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, which might be enacted this month, could make building a typical home as much as $29,000 more expensive, with nearly half of that due to lumber prices. Canada, the U.S.\u2019s biggest foreign lumber supplier, has already been dealing with higher duties on its shipments that started last summer.\n\n3. Freight truckers may find silver lining, despite Q4 GDP miss\n\nThe recent fourth-quarter GDP report revealed that the U.S. economy grew at a slower rate than expected. Despite this, consumer spending remained strong, especially on durable goods, which contributed positively to the GDP, suggests continued robust demand. This scenario of low inventory levels coupled with high consumer demand is expected to drive carrier rates higher, creating a favorable economic environment for freight truckers as the market stabilizes.",

            "content": "Imagine this: a painter in a gallery meticulously selects colors to evoke emotion. Across the street, a coder in a dimly lit room writes algorithms to predict consumer behavior. At first glance, these worlds couldn\u2019t be further apart, but in today\u2019s digital advertising landscape, they\u2019re inseparable.\n\nWe\u2019re at a tipping point where technology doesn\u2019t just support creativity \u2014 it drives it. The convergence of code and creativity has reshaped how brands tell stories, engage consumers, and generate sales. Yet, most leaders in commerce are stuck in yesterday\u2019s model, clinging to old notions of what creativity means in a tech-driven world. It\u2019s time to rethink how we use technology and art together, or risk getting left behind.\n\nHere\u2019s why this matters: Digital advertising is no longer just about stunning visuals or clever taglines. It\u2019s about precision, personalization and performance. The best campaigns today are the perfect blend of human imagination and machine intelligence. If you\u2019re not leveraging this convergence, you\u2019re losing customers to competitors who are.\n\nThe Rise of AI-Creative Collaboration\n\nAI has entered the chat \u2014 literally. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are writing copy, generating images and even brainstorming creative ideas. Some see this as a threat to traditional creativity, but let\u2019s call it what it really is: a cheat code for better work.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: AI can analyze consumer behavior faster than any team of humans ever could. It identifies patterns, predicts trends and personalizes content at scale. That\u2019s not just helpful; it\u2019s transformative. Instead of wasting hours debating what your audience wants, you can spend time creating emotional, meaningful content that resonates because the data already told you what they care about.\n\nThe challenge? Many leaders are either ignoring AI entirely or using it poorly. They treat it like a gimmick instead of a partner. To avoid falling into this trap, invest in understanding how to integrate AI into your creative process. Train your team to use it as an extension of their capabilities, not a replacement. When done right, AI doesn\u2019t dilute creativity \u2014 it amplifies it. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nStorytelling Meets Science\n\nIn the past, storytelling was an art. Today, it\u2019s both an art and a science. The data you collect isn\u2019t just for reporting \u2014 it\u2019s your blueprint for storytelling. Every click, swipe and purchase is a clue into what makes your audience tick. Ignoring this data is like painting blindfolded.\n\nHere\u2019s a real-world example: Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands like Warby Parker and Glossier have mastered this balance. They use customer insights to craft stories that feel personal, almost intimate. Every touchpoint, from their Instagram ads to their email campaigns, feels like it was written just for you. That\u2019s not a coincidence \u2014 it\u2019s the result of combining data science with creativity.\n\nIf you want to replicate their success, start small. Use A/B testing to find out what stories resonate most with your audience. Don\u2019t guess \u2014 test. Let the data guide your creative decisions, and watch how your campaigns become more engaging and effective.\n\nAvoid the Trap of Mediocrity\n\nHere\u2019s a hard truth: Most digital ads are forgettable. Scroll through your social media feed, and you\u2019ll see a parade of ads that look the same, sound the same and perform the same (poorly). Why? Because too many brands are afraid to take risks. They follow trends instead of starting them.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify? Related Content\n\nThis is where creativity needs to fight back. Use the tools of technology, but don\u2019t lose sight of what makes your brand unique. AI can give you insights, but it can\u2019t define your identity. Only you can do that.\n\nTo avoid the trap of mediocrity, challenge your team to think bigger. Ask them, \u201cWhat would we create if there were no rules?\u201d Use AI to test those bold ideas on a small scale. The beauty of digital advertising is that you can experiment without breaking the bank. Stop playing it safe and start creating campaigns people will remember.\n\nThe Human Element Still Wins\n\nFor all the power of AI, there\u2019s one thing it can\u2019t replicate: genuine human connection. People buy from people, not machines. The best campaigns use technology to enhance human creativity, not replace it.\n\nThink of AI as the assistant and your team as the stars. The assistant can organize, analyze and optimize. But the stars bring the magic. It\u2019s the emotional resonance, the bold ideas and the authentic stories that make campaigns succeed.\n\nSo, as you embrace the convergence of tech and art, don\u2019t forget the human element. AI can write headlines, but only a human can make someone laugh, cry or feel inspired. Lean into that.\n\nTake Action Now\n\nThe convergence of code and creativity is already here. The question is whether you\u2019ll use it to your advantage. Here\u2019s how to start:\n\n1. Invest in AI tools that enhance your team\u2019s creativity. Look for platforms that make data actionable and accessible.\n\n2. Upskill your team to use AI effectively. Train them to see it as a collaborator, not a threat.\n\n3. Test, learn, repeat. Use your data to guide bold creative experiments. Let the results shape your strategy.

Stay human. Never lose sight of the emotional connection that makes your brand memorable.\n\nDigital advertising has never been more exciting \u2014 or more competitive. To win, you need to embrace the marriage of tech and art. It\u2019s not code versus creativity; it\u2019s code with creativity. Those who get this could define the next decade of commerce. Those who don\u2019t risk being forgotten.",

While users can choose to pay for certain \u201cpremium upgrades\u201d, the free version includes many of the app\u2019s most used features, like layering and masking that allow users to combine, composite and blend their images.

Additionally, Adobe has also made updates to its Adobe Photoshop web app, bringing features that have historically been bound to the the power of a desktop computer to web browsers worldwide, allowing users who don\u2019t have the app installed to use it by leveraging the power of the cloud.\n\nWhile the free version of the new Adobe Photoshop app is a welcomed step forward in the democratization of the creative industry, users wanting more advanced features are able to pay for the new Photoshop Mobile and Web plan priced at $7.99 USD/month or $69.99 USD/annually. Amongst the \u201cpremium\u201d features included are advanced blend modes, over 20,000 fonts, AI-generated imagery that is commercially safe, and tools like Magic Wand, Clone Stamp and Content-Aware Fill.\n\nThe all-new Adobe Photoshop mobile app is available now for iPhone via the App Store.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe artificial intelligence revolution is fueling a fierce clash for increasingly scarce resources. That appears to be the case, given that a single query on ChatGPT requires nearly 10 times as much electricity as a traditional search query on Google. You will be mistaken to think that only power grids are being strained amid the AI boom.\n\nWater, land, metals, and minerals are some of the natural resources being strained as the AI race heats up. In addition to natural resources, millions of humans are always on dial engineering, correcting and training models at the heart of AI.\n\nAI mostly lives and works in data centers, which are humming with motherboards, chips, and storage devices. The demand for electricity from these centers is currently higher than the supply in many parts of the world. Likewise, Goldman Sachs reports that data centers in the US are likely to use 8% of all electricity by 2030, which is almost three times the percentage in 2022 when the AI craze first started.\n\n\u201cThe data centers have to partner with utilities, the system operators, the communities, to really establish that these things are assets to the grid and not liabilities to the grid. Nobody\u2019s going to keep approving,\u201d said Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers in Texas.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s no longer a secret that resource-intensive AI will create winners and losers. Tech giants willing to spend billions of dollars appear to be having an edge. That might explain why the US tech giants are on course to spend $320 billion in 2025, primarily to enhance their AI infrastructure.\n\nLikewise, it is a battle for supremacy between nations as they look to outdo each other on a technology that\u2019s emerged as a matter of national security. The US has already passed legislation prohibiting the sale of advanced chips and equipment to China. Beijing has also hit back with similar restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe will safeguard American AI and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to adversaries attaining AI capabilities that threaten all of our people,\u201d said US Vice President JD Vance\n\nThe fact that AI is causing conflicts over increasingly limited resources, including chips, is no longer a secret. It is encouraging tech companies to look for more effective ways to develop artificial intelligence. They are investing billions of dollars in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, which have been stuttering along for years or even decades without significant investment or technological advancements. Even though the world is on track to surpass important emissions targets in the fight against climate change, the demands of AI are increasing the pressure to continue burning fossil fuels to power the grid.",

            "content": "Adobe Launches Free Photoshop App For IPhone The new mobile app brings powerful editing tools to users, celebrating 35 years of creativity.\n\nAdobe is celebrating 35 years of its iconic image-editing application, Photoshop, with the much-anticipated launch of a new mobile version. Released on March 3, 2025, the app is currently available for iPhone users, with an Android version scheduled to follow later this year. This marks the first time the complete Photoshop functionality has been presented on mobile devices, eleving convenience for both professional creators and everyday users alike.\n\nThe new app features all of the fundamental elements creative professionals have come to expect from Photoshop, including layering and masking, which are not typically seen in mobile photo editing apps. Users will appreciate the inclusion of the Tap Select tool, which allows for quick and efficient removal, recoloring, and replacement of elements within images. The Spot Healing Brush is another tool included within the app, enabling users to \u201cbrush away distractions in seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the limitless creative possibilities of Photoshop to mobile,\u201d said Ashley Still, senior vice president of Adobe. The app aims to cater to everyone from professional artists to novice creators exploring Photoshop for the first time. Users will benefit from seamless integration with other Adobe mobile applications such as Express and Lightroom, enhancing their overall editing workflow.\n\nOne of the standout features of the app is Adobe\u2019s AI technology, particularly Firefly's Generative Fill and Generative Expand capabilities. These tools are available at no additional cost within the free version of Photoshop for iPhone, providing users with vast creative options on the go and access to Adobe Stock assets.\n\nWith the free version, users are equipped with many of Photoshop\u2019s most utilized features. Notably, they can perform full-resolution editing and apply selective adjustments effortlessly. Adobe\u2019s premium subscription plan is also available at $7.99 per month or $69.99 annually, which provides access to advanced features like over 20,000 fonts, AI-generated imagery, advanced blend modes, and traditional tools such as Magic Wand, Clone Stamp, and Content-Aware Fill.\n\nAdobe's new Photoshop app marks another strategic step by the company to democratize creative tools, making high-quality photo editing accessible. This follows the trend established with the 2019 release of Photoshop for iPads, and it is expected to expand Adobe's user base significantly.\n\nThe launch has been greeted with enthusiasm, yet users have noted the initial learning curve associated with the app. Katelyn Chedraoui, writing for CNET, mentioned experiencing challenges typical when becoming familiar with Photoshop tools\u2014stumbling through menus and adjusting sliders. The compact user interface introduces some frustration, as finding specific tools often requires tapping through different submenus.\n\n\u201cOnce you know where your go-to tools are housed, it\u2019s less inconvenient,\u201d Chedraoui stated. \u201cTap Select, for example, helps isolate project areas you want to edit, but it does come with variability.\u201d This tool, which is integral to the editing process, sometimes struggles to accurately identify the desired elements, reflecting inconsistencies users might face.\n\nGenerative AI features are expectedly at the forefront of the app\u2019s offerings, allowing users to generate images based on prompts. While these features work well, users have reported limitations, such as reduced editing capabilities compared to the desktop version of Photoshop. Chedraoui indicated, \u201cYou get three variations per prompt, but the lack of follow-up editing tools post-generation limits refinement options compared to desktop experiences.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the convenience of using Photoshop on-the-go is one of the app\u2019s biggest assets. Whether adjusting color schemes or adding text for social media, tasks can now be accomplished directly from users\u2019 phones. And the integration with Adobe\u2019s asset library eases the process of enhancing images, allowing users to search and upload without complicated licensing issues.\n\n\u201cThis marks the first time image editing and design features, with such power, precision, and control, have been available for free within one mobile app,\u201d said Adobe. \u201cPhotoshop\u2019s new mobile and web apps push creativity boundaries, empowering creators to produce stunning visuals anywhere.\u201d\n\nAdobe aims to augment this foundation with future updates to improve functionality and address user feedback. With the app, mobile editing aficionados feel they hold the potential to transform their creative expressions right from the palm of their hands.\n\nThe launch of the Photoshop app for iPhone is more than just another product; it symbolizes the evolution of digital creativity and design, making advanced tools surprisingly accessible to both established and new creators within the field. This reflects the growing trend of mobility within the creative workspace\u2014offering enhanced flexibility and breaking traditional boundaries of where and how great art can be created.",

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Adobe Stock\n\nIn Florida and Arizona, men have gathered for that first sign that spring is coming. Forget about birds and flowers, it\u2019s the beginning of spring training for Major League Baseball.\n\nExpand Gary Logan Wes Shannon\n\nIt\u2019s a time of hopefulness and restoration of life. We begin watching the new buds appear that will blossom in late fall as the greatest of all sporting events, the World Series, will unfold.\n\nAs you can tell, I still believe that our national pastime is and continues to be baseball. Football has had its short season, and we are exhausted by the violence. Now we settle down for a pastoral game of fair play, strategy, individual excellence, and teamwork. I believe that baseball is a metaphor for life and for financial planning.\n\nInvesting for the future requires time more than anything. Investing is a long game. Baseball is a long season. One hundred and sixty-two games. Long-term investing will see many downturns, but the upturns make all the difference. In baseball, the best team is going to lose 50 games or more and the worst team is going to win 50 games or more.\n\nWith the stock market I have personally seen four major downturns of the S&P 500 index in the last 24 years and yet the total return during that entire period has beaten indexes of the bond market, real estate, and commodities. Baseball teaches that a few losses don\u2019t mean the season is over. It tells us to be patient.\n\nBaseball also shows us great achievements of the individual, but that alone cannot carry the team. Hank Aaron had only three or four plate appearances, at the most, in a single game. It takes the entire team to get a win. A star pitcher throwing a \u201cno-hitter\u201d can\u2019t do it without a great defensive squad behind him.\n\nThe same with investing: One stock cannot carry an entire portfolio for long. A diversified team of other stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto, and other assets are needed to achieve one\u2019s goals.\n\nBaseball tells us to put failure in prospective. A batter who consistently registers a hit in only three out of 10 at-bats is considered hall-of-fame caliber. Seven out of 10 times he fails to get a hit. I have seen people put everything they had to start a business, and they struggle and fail for three to five years before the business takes off. Some businesses never make it, and the owners have to start over again to save and invest enough to retire. I have a very successful client who failed at his own business in his early 50s and still was able to go back to work and save and still retire comfortably at age 66. Failure is a part of life and baseball shows us how to accept it and move on.\n\nBaseball is unlike all other sports in two distinct ways. First, in baseball the defense controls the ball. Think about how that applies to our financial lives. We control the \u201cball,\u201d our money and investments, and we are defending against losing it or spending it to quickly or having taxes take away too much of it. A financial plan is mostly a defensive playbook. The commitment of the individual to live below their means and save and invest is the offensive part of the game.\n\nThe second way that baseball differs from other sports is that it does not have a clock. Each team gets an equal opportunity to win. The game can go on until someone wins. A batter can stay at the plate and hit foul balls as many times as he wants until the last strike, or he gets on base.\n\nIn financial planning we don\u2019t know how long the game will last. We don\u2019t know when a client\u2019s life will end. We keep doing what we can to provide for and reach goals as long as we can till the big umpire in the sky calls the third strike.\n\nSo, start getting your peanuts, Cracker Jacks, and hot dogs together and go see a Certified Financial Planner\u2122 with the CFP\u00ae marks to get your finances in order.\n\nAnd go, Rangers!\n\nWes Shannon CFP\u00ae is a Certified Financial Planning Professional for Brazos Wealth Advisors in Fort Worth.",

            "content": "The auction house Christie\u2019s is selling its first major collection of artworks generated with the help of artificial intelligence. The auction is attracting big dollar bids, but also controversy \u2014 thousands of artists have signed an open letter calling for the sale to be shut down over concerns that many works were generated with the help of AI tools accused of training on copyrighted works without permission.\n\nThe rise of text-to-image generative AI has roiled creative professions, with some artists fighting back in ongoing lawsuits or by trying to sabotage their data so AI web crawlers can\u2019t train on it. But many art and design professionals are also embracing the new technology as a way to expand their businesses.\n\n\u201cI think that graphic designers are a lot less scared of the AI tools than folks might think they are,\u201d said Nicola Hamilton, president of the Association of Registered Graphic Designers. Surveys of members have found they\u2019re using the technology most often in early brainstorming or for administrative business tasks.\n\n\u201cThe threat for designers stems less from AI itself and more from a lack of education on the employer-client side, about like, how to actually use AI properly,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cWithout designers at the center of this AI usage you\u2019re opening yourself up to really poorly executed campaigns.\u201d\n\nLast year, Paula Scher, a partner and principal at the design firm Pentagram, was leading a project with some unique constraints. The federal government hired them to help create the website performance.gov, which translates long wonky government reports into bite-size, user-friendly summaries for the public.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to make it really completely self-operating \u2014 that the report would automatically turn out in the appropriate typeface and in the appropriate layout and format that we designed,\u201d Scher said.\n\nIt would even generate a unique graphic logo for every topic, from veterans\u2019 health to roadway safety and space technology.\n\nTo make a library of 1,500 pictograms on a limited government budget, Pentagram started with a small sample of original illustrations made in house with paint and cut paper. Then, using an AI tool called Midjourney, they applied the design language to make the rest of the logos. They used text prompts to tweak the style and color palettes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a series of accidents and corrections, just like all art is,\u201d said Scher. But it\u2019s much faster than doing it by hand or with traditional illustration software.\n\nThat\u2019s a big selling point for surrealist digital artist Elise Swopes.\n\n\u201cSaving time \u2014 oh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, if I had the the ability to do what I do now, I would have saved myself maybe years off my life.\u201d\n\nSwopes works as an Adobe \u201cevangelist,\u201d sharing how she incorporates Adobe\u2019s suite of AI tools into her workflow. Features like \u201cgenerative fill,\u201d which allows users to remove parts of an image and fill in the background with AI, or \u201cgenerative expand,\u201d which she uses to adjust the dimensions of her content for various platforms.\n\n\u201cI would feel limited in some aspect if I didn\u2019t give myself the opportunity to learn it and to acknowledge it and to add it to my bank of different skills that I have,\u201d said Swopes.\n\nAdobe\u2019s AI is unique in that it\u2019s trained only on licensed images.\n\nMost other image generators don\u2019t disclose what\u2019s in their training data, which raises ethical and legal questions, said independent branding designer Eric Vasquez, who works on mostly entertainment and sports content.\n\n\u201cA lot of the companies that I work with \u2014 they\u2019re very skeptical about AI,\u201d said Vasquez. \u201cThey don\u2019t want AI to be in the final output of anything that they are going to have as like a client facing image or campaign.\u201d\n\nTo avoid potential copyright infringement, he only uses AI for brainstorming and early mockups.\n\nBut AI could offer new business models for artists like Lisa Vleming, who works with smaller clients. She designs posters, logos, event invitations and more in a retro groovy style.\n\n\u201cMy work is extremely time consuming and my pricing reflects that,\u201d said Vleming. \u201cI get a lot of people that want to work with me, but they can\u2019t afford my services.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s trying out some new AI features launched by the freelance marketplace Fiverr, like the new AI assistants, which Vleming has used to correspond with clients and gather initial information about what they\u2019re looking for.\n\nFiverr also recently launched \u201cCreation Models,\u201d which allow freelancers to train generative AI models on their own body of work, which clients can then use to generate images.\n\n\u201cAnd they can take that and come to me and say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I created. Can you keep that, change this, or just use it as an inspiration?'\u201d Vleming said.\n\nFiverr CEO Micha Kaufman described the AI as \u201canother ultra phase of the industrial revolution, because it makes every person into a production house.\u201d\n\nHe said he hopes the AI tools will help creatives to scale their business in a sustainable way.\n\n\u201cThese models were developed based on the heart and soul of their creators,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s generated very, very fast doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s worthless, it just means that it\u2019s efficient.\u201d\n\nArtists retain control of the models and set their own prices and conditions for what\u2019s generated. Vleming said she hopes it will allow her to take on more clients at lower price points.\n\nThis could feed into concerns the technology will devalue artists\u2019 skills.\n\nBut, after five decades in design, Paula Scher at Pentagram said there\u2019s no use in hiding from AI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten through the notion that you can\u2019t be scared of the technology. You\u2019ve got to find out what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s already seen the job change a lot since the days of literally cutting and pasting images by hand.",

See below for links to the other stocks in this series.\n\nSince its initial public offering ( IPO ) in 1986, Adobe (ADBE) has experienced one of the most impressive growth trajectories in the tech sector , with its stock price skyrocketing by a staggering 250,000%.\n\nThis extraordinary performance can be attributed to several key strategic decisions, including its shift to a subscription-based business model, expansion of its product portfolio, and continued innovation in cloud and artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies. These moves have been critical in enabling Adobe to capitalize on the growing global demand for digital content and marketing solutions.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nAmong the most consequential of its strategic pivots was the 2013 transition from a traditional software licensing model to a cloud-based subscription model. The move also underscores management's vision.\n\nIn 2013, the idea of subscriptions was largely relegated to magazines and newspapers. But why not software? A subscription model would deliver one of the features that Wall Street prizes most: recurring, predictable revenues. If Archimedes said, \"Give me a lever \u2026 and I shall move the world,\" Wall Street says, give me stable cash flows and I shall finance the world. Since then, everything from razor blades to pet food to financial services has had subscription models emerge.\n\nIn the case of Adobe, the shift allowed the company to stabilize its revenue, yes, but also to grow it, because on a subscription basis, the software was more affordable to a wider audience.\n\nThe impact of this change shows up in the growth in earnings before and after the implementation of the subscription model. From the period of 2004 to 2013, i.e. before subscription pricing, the average annual growth in revenues was 10.3%. From 2013 through 2023, i.e. after subscription pricing, the average annual growth in revenues was 17%, an improvement of 65%.\n\nBut there is another important aspect to the shift toward subscriptions that accounts for Adobe's success. Over the long haul, Adobe's gross and operating margins have remained the same, meaning its cost structure was impervious to sustained improvement. That meant the only way to materially improve profitability was to increase sales, and the subscription model delivered the increase that was needed to grow earnings per share.\n\nIn one respect, Adobe got lucky. The emergence of the cloud enabled it to deliver solutions to clients in a much more productive way and this increased overall demand. Adobe's Creative Cloud now boasts more than 30 million subscribers.\n\nThe move to subscriptions not only broadened Adobe's customer base but also significantly increased customer retention, driving long-term profitability.\n\nAlso in the luck department, Adobe was in the right place at the right time. As businesses across all industries accelerated their digital transformation and new companies emerged that were digital only, from promotion to product delivery, the need for sophisticated end-to-end tools to create, manage, and optimize digital media surged.\n\nAdobe solidified its dominant position in this space by expanding its product portfolio. By acquiring companies such as Omniture, Magento, and Marketo, Adobe extended its influence into digital marketing, e-commerce, and customer experience management \u2013 and made good on its proposition of offering a one-stop shop.\n\nThe company has invested in AI with the introduction of Adobe Sensei, an AI and machine learning framework. If AI delivers on its promise to revolutionize commerce, then perhaps it will revolutionize digital marketing and management, offering another leg upward in Adobe's trajectory.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

As with nearly all of Adobe's software, Photoshop and Lightroom Classic are available only via a subscription that lets you install them on two computers at a time.\n\nThe Creative Cloud Photography plan costs $19.99 per month (with an annual commitment) and gets you both flavors of Lightroom and Photoshop and 1TB of cloud storage. If you want just the workflow application, the Lightroom plan costs $11.99 per month (with an annual commitment); paying a full year up front takes the monthly cost down to $9.99. This includes both versions of Lightroom and 1TB of cloud storage. If you\u2019re not interested in Lightroom Classic at all, you can get Photoshop by itself and 100GB of storage for $22.99 per month (with an annual commitment). Frankly, I\u2019m not sure why you would take that last option since you can get both apps and 10 times as much storage for less.\n\nFinally, if you opt for the full Creative Cloud plan that also includes Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and more, you pay $59.99 per month with an annual commitment. You can get Photoshop or the full suite without an annual commitment, but doing so increases the cost to $34.49 and $89.99 per month, respectively.\n\nFor comparison, Photoshop Elements, which serves up a healthy helping of both Photoshop-style editing and Lightroom Classic-style workflow and organization tools, costs $99.99 for a three-year license. It includes a lot of guidance for less technical users.\n\nWinner: Lightroom Classic\n\nAvailability\n\nBoth apps run on macOS 13.1 or later and Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 or later. They work on Arm and Intel machines running either OS. Your PC must have 8GB of RAM at a minimum, though Adobe recommends 16GB or more.\n\nAdobe now offers web and mobile versions of Photoshop and Lightroom, too. You must use the Chrome or Edge browsers to access the former. The Lightroom mobile app is available for both Android and iOS (this is closer in identity to Lightroom than Lightroom Classic). In contrast, the new Photoshop mobile app is iOS-only for now (Adobe plans to bring it to Android). I discuss the mobile apps in a later section.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nImporting and Organization\n\nIf you\u2019re a photographer who needs to import and organize your work on a regular basis, you don't need to go any further in this article: Choose Lightroom Classic because it\u2019s designed to handle workflow. What is workflow? It comprises all the steps from transferring image files from your camera\u2019s memory card to adjusting their color, crop, lighting, and sharpness to outputting the final images either online or in print.\n\nPhotoshop isn't meant to handle importing and managing your photo collection. You can use its ancillary Bridge application for this purpose, but having a single application like Lightroom Classic makes for a more streamlined process.\n\nWinner: Lightroom Classic\n\nWorking With Raw Image Files\n\nBoth Photoshop and Lightroom Classic can open raw camera files, which have extensions like ARW (for Sony), CR3 (for Canon cameras), and NEF (for Nikon). These files are larger than JPGs because they contain more data straight from your camera\u2019s sensor, allowing for more powerful adjustment of lighting and color after the fact. If you shoot in JPG, your camera interprets the sensor data and delivers its best guess as to how the image should look.\n\nIf you edit a raw image file, you can change specific luminosity ranges like highlights or shadows using data from the original sensor capture that doesn't carry over to an initial JPG rendering. This way, you can, for example, pull out the color of a bird that appears only as a black silhouette in the initial JPG version. A JPG simply doesn't retain such information, so you might not have any way of showing that a blackbird is actually a bluebird.\n\nIn Photoshop, you can\u2019t just open a raw camera image directly. When you start opening a raw image file, the separate Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) app pops open and loads your image. This gives you a sort of pre-editor, with adjustments for color, lighting, and sharpness. In fact, you find nearly all of Lightroom's tools in ACR and then can open the result in Photoshop proper for further editing.\n\nLightroom Classic, on the other hand, lets you import raw files and start working on them without the need for an intermediary utility. Lightroom Classic and ACR both offer Adobe\u2019s Raw Profiles, which determine how the software converts the original sensor data into an editable image. You can use a profile based on your camera or choose Adobe Color, Landscape, Monochrome, Portrait, or Vivid. Each tilts the result toward specific color and sharpness levels.\n\nWinner: Lightroom Classic\n\nNondestructive vs. Destructive Editing\n\nA key difference between a photo workflow application like Lightroom Classic and a straight-on image editing one like Photoshop is that the former keeps all your originals and stores editing changes for every photo in a database. In Lightroom Classic parlance, this database is called a catalog. This setup means that the original photo remains intact and accessible at any later time.\n\nWhen you edit an image in Photoshop, you end up with a new image. You can go back to the original only if you save a copy. You can work around this Photoshop behavior with things like adjustment layers, sidecar files for raw files, and snapshots, but Lightroom implements nondestructive workflows automatically.\n\nWinner: Lightroom Classic\n\nImage Adjustment vs. Editing\n\nNote the distinction between image adjustment and editing. The former means applying changes to the color, lighting, and sharpness of an entire image without adding material that doesn\u2019t come from your camera. Editing concerns truly manipulating an image, making changes to particular areas, and adding content like text, shapes, or other images on top of the original. Lightroom Classic\u2019s forte is adjustment, while Photoshop\u2019s is editing. Either can do basic things like smoothing blemishes or fixing red eyes from a flash.\n\nLightroom Classic is perfect for things like brightening an underexposed image or bringing out colors. You can also use it to adjust sharpness and even apply lens corrections. The software does include some local adjustment tools, however. You can use a brush, gradient, or shape to change selected areas, for instance. Cropping, too, is closer to an edit than an adjustment, for which Lightroom Classic has excellent tools.\n\nTrue creative editing is the domain of Photoshop. For example, if you want to cut someone out of a photo or place them in another image with a different background, you need Photoshop's Select and Mask tools.\n\nSome of Photoshop\u2019s most dazzling tools take advantage of Adobe's two AI technologies: Firefly (also available as a standalone web app) and Sensei. The former is a generative AI tool that creates new content for things like extending an image beyond its original borders or replacing an object in the image. Meanwhile, Sensei uses machine learning to analyze and modify images. An example of Sensei in Photoshop is its Neural Filters, which can change the apparent age of a person in a portrait, colorize a black-and-white shot, or make a photo look like a van Gogh painting.\n\nPhotoshop is technically a superset of Lightroom since it (and its ACR utility) can make any adjustments that Lightroom can. In addition, it adds selection tools and many more options, including filters, a liquefy tool, shapes, text, and vectors. But Lightroom Classic keeps getting more tools that were formerly only in Photoshop, like Generative Remove and Generative Extend.\n\nWinner: Photoshop\n\nLayers\n\nOne of Photoshop\u2019s major innovations and differentiators is its support for layers. You can think of these as digital plates of glass above the original image that superimpose an effect or even another image. Moreover, Photoshop provides many blending options for layers, such as darken, dissolve, lighten, multiply, saturation, and subtract\u201429 in all! Serious Photoshop practitioners are skilled at using dozens of layers and even layer groups to create unique results.\n\nPhotographers can use Photoshop's adjustment layers to apply lighting and color adjustments that they can toggle separately from any other adjustments at will. Another type of layer, the mask layer, allows you to block out parts of an image.\n\nLightroom, by contrast, hides layers from you. This is one of the main reasons for the program\u2019s existence: Photographers who just want to process their photos (like in the past when they would use a darkroom) don\u2019t want the added complexity of thinking about and managing layers.\n\nWinner: Photoshop\n\nText, Shapes, Drawing, and 3D\n\nPhotoshop\u2019s text capabilities are deep, with options like glow, stroking, and even glyph editing (changing parts of characters). If text is your main work, however, you should skip Photoshop in favor of Adobe Illustrator, which supports the text-friendly vector file format. You can resize vector images without them losing sharpness, something that\u2019s extremely important for professionals.\n\nLightroom Classic's sole text capability revolves around adding watermarks to photos. For photographers, that\u2019s perfectly acceptable, but creative and technical image designers need at least the extra features in Photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop supports shapes (as design elements) quite well. Lightroom Classic doesn't offer anything similar. Again, however, Illustrator might be the way to go if you often work with shapes. Drawing and painting are a similar story\u2014look to Photoshop's myriad brush styles or even to Adobe\u2019s excellent (and free) Fresco drawing app.\n\nWinner: Photoshop\n\nState-of-the-Art Tools\n\nOccasionally, Adobe adds cutting-edge features only to Photoshop. Examples include the Firefly-powered Generate Background, Generative Expand, Generative Fill, and Generate Image tools, as well as the aforementioned Neural Filters.\n\nAdobe also updates Lightroom Classic extensively. In addition to raw file support for new camera models, Lightroom now offers automatic masking, background blur, and the previously mentioned Generative Expand and Generative Remove AI tools.\n\nWinner: Photoshop\n\nTethering\n\nTethered shooting is when your camera, usually connected with a USB cable or wirelessly via Wi-Fi, sends photos to software on your computer as soon as you shoot them. This allows you to see the full-size images immediately and start editing, cataloging, and sharing them.\n\nLightroom Classic is your go-to for tethered shooting. Neither Photoshop nor non-classic Lightroom has that capability.\n\nWinner: Lightroom Classic\n\nPrinting\n\nBoth photo applications have strong printing capabilities, with support for color profiles, output sharpening, and soft proofing. Lightroom Classic offers more in the way of layout options, including contact sheets, and it makes watermarking a simple part of the print setup. If local printing is important to you, choose Lightroom Classic over the non-Classic version; the latter doesn't have a local printing capability.\n\nPhotoshop supports more file formats, such as PDF and TIFF, which professional print services prefer.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nMobile Editing\n\nIf you need to edit photos on the go, Adobe offers mobile apps for Photoshop and Lightroom. The company started offering Photoshop for iPad in 2022 and launched Photoshop for Mobile in 2025. These versions are surprisingly capable. They don't have full feature parity with the desktop versions but integrate well with them\u2014you can save your work as cloud documents and open them on either platform.\n\nThe Lightroom mobile apps let you edit and shoot photos from your phone, giving you excellent control over the latter. Both versions offer nearly all the adjustments from the desktop version. Note that syncing photos with the Lightroom app is more straightforward if you're using Lightroom (non-Classic) on the desktop.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nVerdict: No Wrong Choice\n\nIf you tally up the results from the above categories, here's how things stand:\n\nPhotoshop: 4 wins\n\nLightroom Classic: 5 wins\n\nTies: 3\n\nIn other words, each has specific strengths, and they overlap in some areas. Choosing between Lightroom Classic and Photoshop isn't about which product you should buy\u2014both come with Adobe\u2019s Photography Plan subscription\u2014but rather which you should use. The answer may well be both.\n\nLightroom Classic is your go-to for getting the images off your camera card, organizing them, and fixing their color, lighting, and geometry. Stick with Photoshop for deep image manipulation that involves adding shape and text overlays, applying artistic filters, and masking people and objects. Meanwhile, if you want to process a photo you take and then make various creative edits, there's no better combination than Lightroom Classic and Photoshop.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other tech stocks with high upside potential.\n\nAs per Forrester Research, Inc., despite persistent inflation, the US real GDP is expected to increase 2.7% in 2025 and the US tech spending is projected to see growth of 6.1% to touch a staggering $2.7 trillion. The software spending in the US is expected to increase by 10.7% in 2025. With the escalation in cybersecurity risks, companies continue to leverage cloud and GenAI technologies to fuel future growth and innovation.\n\nAI to Drive Growth in Tech Sector in 2025\n\nThe largest US stocks, also referred to as the Magnificent 7, have seen a strong run over the previous 2 years, mainly due to the buildout of AI infrastructure, says Goldman Sachs. Sung Cho, co-head of US Fundamental Equity in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Cho believes this buildout can significantly benefit data and security companies, and software companies successfully integrating AI in their existing product set. As the Fed continues to cut rates, the smaller tech companies \u2013 which saw contraction in their multiples because of higher rates \u2013 might see a favourable macro backdrop.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nRobust AI Investments are On the Horizon\n\nUBS has highlighted how AI has and will continue to drive the growth of the broader technology sector. As per the firm, since the rollout of ChatGPT in November 2022, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the US technology exchange NASDAQ increased to ~US$13.5 trillion. Notably, around two-thirds of this value increase has been directly caused by the AI sector. Moving forward, the decisive factor is expected to be the extent to which significant investments in AI-based infrastructure can be translated into profitable business models.\n\nWhile highlighting the consensus estimates, UBS stated that the 4 major US technology corporations are projected to invest ~US$280 billion in AI this year. Given the increased usage of this key technology across industries, value creation processes are expected to be optimized. This can lead to significant productivity gains. One such area is the market for robotics and automation, which is expected to reach a sales volume of ~US$350 billion in 2025, says UBS analysts. Notably, humanoid robotics will be the key area of particular interest because of the innovations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Tech Stocks with High Upside Potential, we used a screener and shortlisted the stocks catering to the broader technology sector. Next, we filtered out the stocks having an average upside potential of at least ~30%, as of February 28. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~34.5%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 117\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a technology company. Barclays reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock with the price objective of $567 after it rolled out its public video beta via new tiered offerings, Firefly Standard and Firefly Pro. The analyst believes that this is a step in the right direction. Furthermore, Barclays opines that Firefly can now be monetized as part of a Creative Cloud subscription. To give a brief context, Firefly is a suite of generative AI-powered features for creating image content. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s Firefly platform continues to demonstrate healthy user engagement.\n\nThrough providing AI-enhanced features as premium add-ons or via tiered pricing models, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to increase average revenue per user and bring new customers looking for cutting-edge creative tools. Furthermore, the integration of Firefly into Adobe Express makes it simpler for SMBs and non-designers to develop content of improved quality. This can help Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) penetrate the digital content creation market, such as influencers and social media marketers.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWe added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.\u201d\n\nOverall, ADBE ranks 7th on our list of tech stocks with high upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Envision your future job site: autonomous bots doing layout, material staging and installations; drones conducting inspections; and office staff using virtual reality to interact with a digital twin comparing the plans to the as-built. For leaders of most construction firms, that future state for the field is not something they expect to see this decade.\n\nIn the office, AI agents are no longer a vision of the future. Agents are already being used to improve the user experience for construction business applications such as Procore, Salesforce and Microsoft PowerBI. And new developments have made it accessible for almost any business to tailor AI tools to specific trades, projects and the unique knowledge held by their organization. Adding a GenAI workstream to your technology road map is a crucial step in keeping your firm ahead in the face of a changing industry, tight margins, and growing competition.\n\nMeet the New AI\n\nBehind the layer that users interact with, there are a number of deeper technical concepts that executives need to be familiar with; the most important of those topics being retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent frameworks.\n\nEarly large language models (LLMs) were trained on public data and had knowledge cutoffs that limited their relevance in business use. Hallucinations were commonly observed and were cited as the reason for companies\u2019 slow adoption of GenAI. Large companies could create, pre-train, or fine-tune a model with data more relevant to their use cases, but doing so required considerable investment and technology knowledge. And historically, construction firms haven\u2019t been the first to invest in innovations where ROI is far from assured.\n\nRAG solves these challenges and makes organization-specific tuning accessible by introducing two critical capabilities:\n\nRAG allows for LLMs to inference over both public and private data.\n\nRAG can inference over both structured and unstructured data.\n\nNow, implementing the right solutions means that AI can generate output based on data specific to your business, and it does more than inference over basic text. It can draw from all your organization\u2019s data, including emails, chats, PDFs and recorded meetings \u2014 even your construction management, ERP, BIM, and VDC datasets.\n\nAdditionally, organizations can use agentic AI to complete more complex tasks with less human intervention. Agentic AI helps reduce the burden on users who are counting on the promise of GenAI tools that can do more than simple one-off tasks. Unlike their non-agentic counterparts, LLM-enabled tools paired with agent frameworks can find information and use tools to complete difficult tasks without needing extra instructions from a user.\n\nInitial experiences with ChatGPT were saddled by the limitations of early chat bots \u2014 users provided a message to it, and it generated an immediate response. When using the tools emerging in 2025, there is a notable difference in the agentic user experience.\n\nNow, rather than a simple, immediate response, the agents can build a plan based on a prompt. Following that planning step, they can trigger a series of downstream actions that call other agents with access to internal organizational data. Those insights from an organization\u2019s private data can then be combined with insights derived from public data that the model was trained on or that the model is retrieving from the public web. Another downstream agent might also prepare a list of questions for you to answer that will provide clarity to the agents building the output.\n\nAfter building up a robust research context, often over the course of minutes or hours, the agent can deliver an output to the user that not only has greater relevance and accuracy but also has length, density, and citations with links to the source data used to inform the generated output.\n\nWith these capabilities, AI agents are nearing the point where they can output a completed deliverable such as a strategic plan, an RFP response or a legally sound contract that is ready to execute.\n\nRAG & AI Agents in Action\n\nThe latest AI developments can help you go beyond helpful automations to transform the way you do business.\n\nPreviously, if you asked an AI tool to help build up budgetary estimates for a new data center, it would be able to inference public data to provide you with a framework for estimating. And while that framework would be a helpful starting point, it would also likely be outdated, too general to fully apply to your business or even contain inaccurate information.\n\nScreenshot by Wipfli, captured February 2025\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Wipfli, captured February 2025\n\n\n\nNow, with RAG and AI agents, your company can provide the same prompt and get a more functional output, especially when it can seek clarifications from members of the team.\n\nAs an example, AI could help estimate a data center with specifications such as:\n\n1,000,000 gross square feet\n\nHigh-voltage electrical system\n\nEvaporative cooling system\n\nThe AI tooling can inference over your company\u2019s historical data, including prior estimates for buildings that had a similar purpose, size or requirements, giving you a more accurate output that\u2019s relevant to your specific project needs. It may also ask the team to provide additional details related to site conditions, zoning requirements, sustainability goals or timeline constraints.\n\nAfter churning through the downstream reasoning steps, the output can be formatted based on the style guidelines you\u2019ve established for previous estimates. Lastly, learnings from this estimation collaboration can be captured in the model\u2019s memory to help ensure even smoother collaboration on estimates in the future.\n\nScreenshot by Wipfli, captured February 2025\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Wipfli, captured February 2025\n\n\n\nAI Use Cases\n\nRAG provides an easier, cost-efficient way to custom-train the LLM that powers your AI agents. By configuring the agents to interact with your firm\u2019s data, you can leverage it to improve your workforce\u2019s effectiveness, retain talent, win better projects and protect against margin compression as peers and competitors inevitably invest in the same.\n\nPotential AI use cases for your construction firm include:",

            "content": "As the new U.S. government unleashes DOGE to deliver in its promise to cut down costs and achieve efficiency, privately owned businesses are also doubling down on operations to identify potential areas for cost reduction, especially as new tariffs threaten margins. The latest Hackett Report reveals that procurement teams plan to make greater savings in 2025 compared to 2024, using a two-pronged approach of both price reduction and cost avoidance. The same report highlights that the Top 3 priorities for procurement teams in 2025 include improving spend cost reduction, ensuring supply continuity and transforming the operating model. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that help streamline and automate operations, while providing additional insights through rapid and broad data analysis, stand out as a key pathway to drive collaborative efficiencies across the supply chain.\n\nWhile efficiency has always been a mainstay of doing good business, the renewed focus on cost cutting is certainly in part due to the geopolitical climate and its impact on supply chains, decision making and investments. While blanket 25% tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico have so far been postponed to March 12, the full levy will immediately be applied to steel entering the United States from the two countries. Exemptions to this toll cover Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, which, however, has been called upon by Canada to take a stance alongside its former commonwealth ally on tariffs.\n\nExisting supply chain agreements are being rocked, not only by U.S. imposed levies but by the flurry of counter tariffs that other countries will impose in retaliation. While Canada is promoting a \u201cBuy Canadian\u201d stance, effectively urging citizens to boycott American products, China has responded to a 10% tariff hike with targeted counter measures and an antitrust investigation into Google. China will also impose a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products entering from the United States as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars and has announced controls on the export of some of its rare minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium which play a critical role in the U.S. economy in industries such as aircraft, vehicle, solar panel and semiconductor manufacture. By contrast, President Trump is in talks with India, which may actually lower its tariffs to benefit from the shifting supply chain axis.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that this climate of uncertainty is driving at least some of the desire to reduce expenditure in businesses that realize they should be leveraging technological tools to help enact strategies to build cash reserves as they face price hikes, conflict and resource scarcity. Yet how to achieve efficiency in a shifting scenario, where traditional suppliers may suddenly become off-limits, is no simple task. Businesses importing steel in particular may need to reevaluate where their suppliers are based. Makers of cans for sodas, beer and foods, automotive manufacturers and the construction and housing industry, as well as producers of electrical appliances will all have to consider sourcing at least some of their steel from outside the usual Canada or Mexico supply chain, which currently provides 90% of overall scrap aluminum and 70% of the material for canned foods. While the objective of steel tariffs is to reinforce national production, the reality is that the infrastructure to rapidly respond to such a huge increase in demand is simply not there and will take years before enough facilities are built to produce the required volumes of goods entirely autonomously.\n\nWhen it comes to contrasting the impact of tariffs, therefore, one knee jerk reaction might be to try and renegotiate contracts to shave off some overheads. This is, however, a shortsighted strategy that undermines overarching business objectives relating to quality and customer satisfaction, while also damaging supplier relationships. In addition to this, shaving off the impact of a levy as high as 25% will inevitably erode margins to potentially unacceptable levels for both parties. Finally, counter measures by international governments may also include controlling volumes of goods that are shipped to a specific country, making any type of price-deal ineffective anyway.\n\nSupply chain executives must therefore find other strategies to effectively achieve cost savings and draw up new supplier maps fit for a changing world. Improving supplier collaboration is a key way to reduce costs and gain a broader range of advantages, such as helping de-risk operations while maintaining high standards of quality and service, better pricing, and more innovative solutions to boot. For example, suppliers that provide heavily taxed components may suggest new sources for raw materials, perhaps tapping into emerging markets. This could help drive down costs for both parties while also providing a larger plethora of choices to the buyer. Similarly, the supplier may suggest some alternatives that are more sustainable or bring additional ethical benefits that previously compared unfavorably with the market on pricing.\n\nFinally, to achieve these objectives, procurement leaders should consider focusing on a few collaborative strategies driving shared visibility to ensure information is immediately available to all decision makers. Potential price hikes concerning Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers can be addressed successfully with suitable alternatives, if they are planned for in advance. Avoiding stock outs, production halts and bottlenecks is critical in this climate and can be achieved through the analysis of pooled information.\n\nTo avoid overburdening procurement departments and suppliers at this complex time, it is critical that information sharing is streamlined and automated, leveraging the potential of AI tools wherever possible. This will ensure that alerts, updates and other critical information reaches destination in a timely way and without potential errors introduced by manual data entry. Achieving a clear and overarching view of the supply chain will help protect businesses from future uncertainty, while also offering a much broader and more complete analysis of the complex international market. Companies that want to stay ahead of the game have already invested in solutions that support the integration of data siloed in different departments and from the outside world such as the IoT, combining these solutions with data from across the supply chain will help navigate the new world of supply chain. As global trade gets rewritten, businesses that are able to see further and more clearly, by analyzing and processing market data, hold a key competitive advantage.",

            "content": "Adobe announced the launch of Acrobat Sign\u2019s next generation e-signing experience. Traditionally, e-signature platforms render agreements as images, which causes significant problems for users. In contrast, their new e-signing experience, built on Acrobat\u2019s trusted global standard PDF viewer, renders the agreement as a native PDF. This unlocks major improvements in two key areas of the e-signing experience: streamlining agreement completion across mobile and desktop and improving accessibility.\n\nSince the launch of the new Sign experience, Adobe customers have seen a significant improvement in agreement completion rates. Signers describe the experience as intuitive and polished and say it makes understanding agreements easier and speeds up signing.\n\nStreamlining agreement completion\n\nSigners represent a diverse range of backgrounds and technical abilities. Adobe designed the new experience to empower the signer to confidently navigate, fill, and complete agreements across desktop and mobile devices.\n\nThe user journey starts through an email. Building trust at this stage is crucial. Without it, users may dismiss or delete the email, mistaking it for spam. The Acrobat design prioritises displaying the sender\u2019s name first in the email subject that appears in the signer\u2019s Inbox, building immediate trust. The sender\u2019s custom branding is clearly displayed at the top of the email message inviting the user to review and sign the agreement.\n\nOnce the user lands on the agreement, Acrobat guide the signer through the completion process with intuitive navigation and clear visual progress indicators. This minimises confusion, streamlines the experience, and helps the signer complete the agreement accurately.\n\nAfter a user signs and completes the agreement, they must click \u201cSubmit\u201d to finalise the process. However, many users unintentionally overlook this step, leaving agreements incomplete. To address this, Adobe introduced a pulsing animation on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to draw the user\u2019s attention and encourage them to complete the action.\n\nQuickly find key information with native search\n\nSigning an agreement isn\u2019t just about placing a signature. When working with documents \u2014 especially lengthy ones such as contracts \u2014 finding specific information can make all the difference. Adobe added search functionality so users can get to the details they care about easily. It\u2019s as easy as \u201cControl F\u201d.\n\nImprove page navigation\n\nTo make it easier to browse long documents \u2014 such as onboarding handbooks, training materials, etc. \u2014 Adobe has included thumbnails for quick references. Instead of scrolling each page, signers can get a sense for the document\u2019s content with high resolution page thumbnails in the right-hand pane.\n\nAccessibility: Agreement reading and filling\n\nWith more than 1.3 billion people experiencing significant disabilities (one of every six people in the world), it is critical that digital agreements are accessible. Not only is digital accessibility an opportunity to build trust with clients, partners, and employees, but regulatory guidelines have continued to get more rigorous in this area. This is especially relevant for industries such as healthcare, education, and government. Adobe has long been a trusted leader in documents, known for creating the PDF format and leading the development of accessibility features within PDFs. As digital accessibility laws evolve, Adobe is improving their platform to help create a more inclusive digital world.\n\nExisting e-signature solutions reduce agreements to flat images, erasing critical formatting and accessibility tags. This turns clear, structured text into an unformatted text blob, making agreements harder to read and engage with effectively. In the worst case, signers cannot read the document at all.",

But this isn't your typical market correction \u2014 it's a wake-up call for an industry that's trying to solve 2025's challenges using 1995's playbook.\n\nWhat does the alarm bell sound like? Only 3.4% of industrywide positions are currently open, the lowest since 2020. While economic headlines and rising borrowing costs typically get the blame, I'm seeing something deeper in my work with construction leaders. This labor shortage is a reflection of a larger issue: a leadership identity crisis.\n\nMany companies, naturally, are hunkering down, waiting for market conditions to improve before making critical hiring decisions. But the real opportunity is fundamentally reimagining how we attract, retain, and optimize talent to secure a competitive advantage. Why? Well, the construction industry has always prided itself on building things that last. Yet when it comes to building lasting teams and organizations, too many of us are using outdated blueprints.\n\nIt's time to put down the \"tough it out\" toolbox and pick up something more powerful: behavioral intelligence. Because in today's market, the most successful businesses will be those that understand and work with the human element of the job site, not those with the deepest pockets, biggest equipment fleet or glitzy tech.\n\nThe Traditional Playbook is Failing\n\nThe best construction leaders I know constantly question old assumptions about talent. While market conditions matter, winning firms are exploring smarter ways to attract and keep skilled workers. That means looking beyond the basics of pay and benefits to understand what actually drives performance on modern job sites.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data from December 2024 reveals a key insight into our industry's current trajectory. As residential construction slows, nonresidential projects are fueling 3.7% employment growth. Smart firms see this split market as an ideal time to strengthen their teams and refine their talent approach.\n\nHere's what I see happening on job sites across the country: A veteran foreman brings decades of hard-earned wisdom and problem-solving skills. His millennial project coordinator introduces new digital solutions that boost efficiency. The superintendent connecting them sees opportunities in both approaches. When these perspectives align, the results are impressive.\n\nThree different generations, three valuable approaches to getting work done. Your experienced workers excel at hands-on problem-solving and mentoring. Your younger talent drives innovation and fresh thinking. And those mid-career leaders? They're masterful at bringing these strengths together.\n\nWhen construction firms embrace diverse work styles and perspectives, the impact ripples across every aspect of operations. Safety improves because teams communicate better. Problem-solving gets sharper as different viewpoints surface solutions. Project quality rises when everyone brings their strengths to the table.\n\nBehavioral Data: The Missing Data Link in Modern Construction\n\nA mid-sized general contracting firm in Chicago was wrestling with the industry's biggest challenges: high turnover, team friction, and the endless cycle of replacing skilled workers. But instead of accepting these problems as inevitable, they turned to behavioral data for answers.\n\nBy implementing behavioral assessments, this firm gained insights into how their people naturally work, communicate, and solve problems. The results speak volumes. They cut their attrition rate by 4%, saving roughly $180,000 annually in turnover costs. More importantly, they discovered something powerful about their team composition.\n\nTake their crew assignments, for example. Instead of just matching skills to tasks, they started considering behavioral fits. They paired detail-oriented superintendents with big-picture project managers. They matched methodical safety coordinators with dynamic site supervisors. These changes resulted in better communication, fewer conflicts, and projects that ran smoother.\n\nThis approach matters even more in today's multi-generational workforce. When you understand that your veteran foreman's methodical approach complements your millennial project coordinator\u2019s innovative mindset, you stop seeing generational gaps and start seeing opportunities for collaboration.\n\nSometimes, simple math is hard to see. Replacing a skilled construction worker costs between 50% and 200% of their annual salary, but this doesn\u2019t count the hidden costs of lost productivity and team disruption. When firms apply behavioral insights to their hiring and team-building, they can expect improved engagement, presenteeism, and retention, which can have a dramatic impact on the bottom line.\n\nBuilding a Future-Ready Construction Workforce\n\nWant to know what sets top construction firms apart in 2025? It's not their equipment or their technology \u2014 it's their ability to build an intentional culture where people feel valued and want to stay. Here's what that looks like in practice:\n\nPsychological Safety Drives Better Projects: When workers feel secure enough to speak up about safety concerns or suggest process improvements, projects run better. Sites with strong psychological safety see fewer accidents and faster problem resolution because people don't hesitate to raise red flags or share better solutions.\n\nWhen workers feel secure enough to speak up about safety concerns or suggest process improvements, projects run better. Sites with strong psychological safety see fewer accidents and faster problem resolution because people don't hesitate to raise red flags or share better solutions. Human Connection Matters More Than Ever: Technology is transforming our sites, but success still hinges on relationships. The most effective teams find the sweet spot between digital efficiency and personal interaction. Your best crew leaders know when to rely on project management software and when a face-to-face conversation will get better results.\n\nTechnology is transforming our sites, but success still hinges on relationships. The most effective teams find the sweet spot between digital efficiency and personal interaction. Your best crew leaders know when to rely on project management software and when a face-to-face conversation will get better results. Flexibility Opens New Doors: Even in construction, where much work requires being on-site, flexibility matters, especially to the 91% of leaders who see it as key to satisfaction. Office staff, project managers, and estimators often can split time between site and home without impacting quality. The key is matching work arrangements to both project needs and individual work styles.\n\nModern construction blends proven practices with fresh thinking to build teams that can handle whatever the market throws at them.\n\nThe 2025 Game Plan\n\nLet's cut through the complexity and focus on three actions you need to take now to prepare for 2025's construction demands:\n\nFirst, map your team's behavioral patterns. Identify who thrives under pressure, who excels at detailed planning, and who builds the strongest relationships with clients and subcontractors. Understanding how your people naturally work helps you leverage their strengths across projects.\n\nSecond, invest in your frontline leaders' people skills. Your superintendents and foremen shape daily site culture. Give them tools to read team dynamics, manage conflicts, and build psychological safety. Both technical expertise and people management determine project success.\n\nThird, build flexibility into your operations where it makes sense. Review which roles truly need full-time site presence and where hybrid arrangements could work. Smart flexibility means giving your people the autonomy to deliver their best work while maintaining project momentum.\n\nThe construction firms that will achieve lasting prosperity recognize that success depends on understanding their people's capabilities and creating environments where those capabilities flourish. Start building that foundation now.",

            "content": "I assume pigs are currently merrily soaring through the air, because Photoshop has arrived for iPhone. A mere 16 and a half years since the App Store\u2019s inception, Adobe has deemed our smartphones worthy of its flagship app. (Well, Apple ones. An Android release is due later.) This, we\u2019re told, is the final frontier. The ultimate proof that, yes, even a phone can now handle \u2018proper work\u2019 and is no mere plaything for mainlining bite-sized videos until you go boggle eyed. Right? Well\u2026 it\u2019s complicated.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Photoshop matters. To the history of computing. To the wider gadget ecosystem. It\u2019s a giant, so ingrained in the world of tech that people use \u2018photoshop\u2019 as a verb \u2013 until Adobe\u2019s lawyers hear you and mete out just punishment by bludgeoning you to death with a boxed copy of Photoshop 5 while screaming \u201cI\u2019ll adjust(ment layer) YOUR FACE\u201d. But as I installed Photoshop on my iPhone and spent a few hours messing around with it, a nagging sense of unease settled in. In 2008, Photoshop in your hand was the mobile dream. Here in 2025, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nBack to the future\n\nAnd you thought the 24in iMac display was a bit small for Photoshop.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because I\u2019m a card-carrying Photoshop hater. That\u2019s fashionable in certain circles, but my relationship with the app is long and (mostly) healthy. Adobe unleashed Photoshop 35 years ago, at which point the height of tech I had access to was a Commodore 64. But my school\u2019s shiny new graphic design suite then bought a few decidedly unshiny beige Macs, on which Photoshop was duly installed. Alongside a horrendously expensive laser printer, this set-up felt like a glimpse of the future. Adobe\u2019s app was subsequently rarely far from my digits.\n\nI spent a terrifying sum of cash on a boxed copy when I got my first Mac while at university. By that point, Photoshop had layers (magic!) and blasted forth from my Trinitron in glorious full colour. My first job saw me wrestling with Photoshop, coaxing web design layouts from its throng of windows and menus. I may have jumped for joy when, in 1998, version 5 introduced layer effects. I could suddenly create then-seemingly-mandated hideous bevelled buttons in a fraction of the time. And even as my life as a web designer later began to fade and Adobe moved to \u2013 hiss! \u2013 subscriptions, I dutifully continued to pay my monthly fee.\n\nPhotoSTOP\n\nWhile Adobe snoozed, apps like Procreate (above) and Snapseed glued themselves to millions of iPhones.\n\nSo: Photoshop on an iPhone. It\u2019s surprisingly good. Much of the familiar toolset is present, optimised for touch. But I fast realised none of that mattered. As Stuff \u2018Editor In The Big Chair\u2019 Dan Grabham suggested to me the other day, surely most people just want to crop photos and remove unwanted objects? Loads of free apps exist for the former, and Photoshop makes you pay for the latter. Worse, it fumbles the execution; in my tests, it lagged behind Apple\u2019s freebie Photos in terms of speed and finesse.\n\nEven the painting tools gave me pause. They aren\u2019t locked behind payments, but the free Sketchbook is just as capable; and if you seek true digital artistry on mobile, Procreate \u2013 even in its \u2018Procreate in a shoebox\u2019 iPhone incarnation \u2013 is superior.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me. Perhaps this app is for the jobbing pro user who\u2019ll one day find themselves on a train, with only a phone to hand, desperately needing to adjust a gradient for a demanding and impatient client. If that\u2019s your reality, rejoice. You\u2019ve got your wish. Mine was for apps like Photoshop to come to mobile years ago. They did. Adobe didn\u2019t. Now, Photoshop has arrived, fashionably late to the party, only to find out everyone else is wearing better outfits.",

            "content": "Portable Document Format, or PDF, was developed back in the early nineties as a way to replace a number of competing formats like DjVu, Envoy, Fallaron, PostScript, etc. in the early years of the World Wide Web. With Adobe controlling it as a proprietary format until 2008, Adobe Reader has been the go-to PDF Reader on our computers for as long as most of us can remember. However, it is bloated and slow, and the paid version is too costly. So if you are looking for a free and light option, here are the best Adobe Reader alternatives you can use.\n\nBest Adobe Reader Alternatives for Easy PDF Reading\n\nIn this article, we have mentioned 10 apps that you can use to replace Adobe Reader. Below are the quick links to all the apps included in this list. You can click on the links to quickly move to the apps you find interesting.\n\n1. Sumatra PDF \u2013 Best Adobe Reader Alternative for Windows\n\nAlso Read: How to Scan Documents on Android\n\nSumatra is a free and open-source PDF reader that also made it to our best PDF readers lit. has a simple, intuitive user interface and is light on your computer\u2019s resources. The program was first released in 2006 and is hosted on Github, like many of its open-source compatriots. What\u2019s truly remarkable is that while Adobe Reader is a massive 105MB download, Sumatra PDF weighs in at just over 7MB.\n\nThe best thing about the program is how fast it is compared to some of the other similar programs in the market. It starts up almost instantaneously and renders even complex documents in the blink of an eyelid.\n\nSumatra PDF is, admittedly, a bit short on features compared to some of its rivals, but it does come with a large number of keyboard shortcuts to help users navigate pages quickly and efficiently. It also comes in both portable and installer versions, so as a user, you\u2019re able to carry it on a USB flash drive to read documents on any computer anywhere.\n\nAnother point to note here is that the program is able to open not just PDF files, but is a complete ebook reader with the ability to read various other file formats, such as ePub, Mobi, XPS, CHM, DjVu, CBZ, CBR, etc. Pros Cons Incredibly small size A bit too simple Open-source and free\n\nExtremely fast render times\n\nSupports many other file formats\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nPrice: Free\n\n2. Foxit Reader \u2013 Best PDF Reader With Annotations\n\nFoxit PDF editor is one of the best PDF editors around and Foxit Reader is easily one of the best PDF readers and another top-tier alternative to the Adobe Reader. It comes with many of the features that Sumatra PDF lacks. As a trade-off, it is neither as lightweight, nor as fast, but is perhaps, the best option if you want anything more than barely opening and reading PDF documents.\n\nNot only can Foxit Reader annotate PDF documents, but it also allows users to fill out PDF forms making it stand out from most of its free competitors. The program also offers a Safe Reading Mode that shields users from malicious links within PDF documents and provides control over JavaScript integration. You\u2019ll also feel much more at home since Foxit\u2019s interface is similar to Microsoft Office\u2019s ribbon-based interface.\n\nIt also comes with a variety of free downloadable add-ons that allow users to convert PDFs to other document file formats (and vice versa) by integrating into the Windows Explorer context menu. Overall, the program is one of the best, most powerful, flexible, and customizable PDF readers available today, and should be more than enough for 99% of users.\n\nPros Cons Free to use Not as lightweight Can edit PDFs to an extent\n\nAdd-ons for other PDF operations\n\nA safe mode to prevent malicious attacks\n\nPlatforms: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n3. UPDF \u2013 Advanced Adobe Reader Alternative\n\nUPDF is a modern take on PDF viewers and editors and it can both view and edit PDFs for you. For starters, it can annotate PDFs, Merge or Split them, recognize text, and even convert it to another format. Then there\u2019s the AI Assistant which can help summarize, translate, create a mind map, or help you understand the contents of the PDF. In the free version, you get 100 questions a day and 5 PDF searches, which is pretty good.\n\nThe tool is cross-platform and is available on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The user interface is pretty modern, and you get pretty much all the features you\u2019d expect from a good PDF viewer and editor software. UPDF\u2019s Pro plan costs $39 for individual and comes with a free trail. The AI assistant is $79, which is a bit expensive. Overall though, the free version should be quite sufficient. This makes UPDF one of the best PDF viewers and Adobe Reader alternatives you can download. Pros Cons Free version is pretty good Expensive Can edit PDFs\n\nOCR add-ons to recognize text\n\nPDF conversion\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS\n\nPrice: Free, $39 for Pro, $79 for AI assistant\n\n4. Preview \u2013 Best Adobe Reader Alternative for Mac\n\nIf you are a Mac user and need a PDF viewer that just work, you really don\u2019t need a third-party app. Instead, use Preview. It\u2019s the default image and PDF viewer app on iOS, a lightweight app that helps view, edit, annotate, or even sign PDFs. This not only makes a good Adobe Reader alternative for Mac, but one that doesn\u2019t miss out on features.\n\nWith options like Text Selection, Sketch, Draw, add text, borders, and Form fill, Preview makes editing PDFs extremely easy. If you\u2019re a professional who often needs to sign on PDFs, you can simply open the PDF, click the Markup tool, and click the signature option. You can then use the trackpad to create a signature to save and add to your current and future PDFs. Pros Cons Good feature set for a built-in app Not available on other Apple OSes like iPad OS and iOS Can edit PDFs to an extent\n\nIncredibly light and fast\n\nExtremely easy to use\n\nPlatform Availability: macOS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n5. Web Browsers \u2013 Best Adobe Reader Alternative for Everyone\n\nAll major browsers come with a built-in PDF viewer feature, including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Therefore, unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock disconnected from the internet, you can easily double-click on a file and it should open in your default browser.\n\nFirefox was the first web-browser to integrate the PDF viewer functionality when it incorporated the web standards-based pdf.js platform for parsing and rendering PDF files. Google followed that up by bringing the feature to Chrome and now, even Microsoft Edge, can natively render PDF documents. The latter can even edit PDFs to some extent, eliminating the need of having a dedicated PDF reader. This is why it\u2019s one of the best Chrome alternatives.\n\nUnless you\u2019re looking for a dedicated PDF reader with advanced annotation, e-signing, OCR, many more capabilities, all the web browsers should serve you well. Not to mention, if you have an ancient PC whose storage is hanging by its last thread, you can prevent axing another app to download a PDF reader.\n\nPros Cons Quick and easy to use Not meant for advanced PDF editing Some can edit PDFs\n\nAdd-ons available to enhance the experience\n\nSaves space\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS\n\nPrice: Free\n\n6. SlimPDF Reader \u2013 Lightest Adobe Reader Alternative\n\nAlso Read: How to Convert PDF to Google Docs\n\nAs is evident from its name, SlimPDF Reader is a small and lightweight PDF reader available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The program weighs in at just 1.4MB, making it, by far, the smallest actively-developed PDF viewer we know of right now.\n\nLike Sumatra PDF, this one also has a minimalist interface and, works exactly as advertised for the most part. It doesn\u2019t really offer too many bells and whistles, which is of course, understandable given its tiny footprint.\n\nIf bloatware on your PC is a big concern for you and you\u2019re not really looking to create, annotate or otherwise do anything more with PDF files than just viewing them, this piece of software should be the one you need to check out before trying out anything else.\n\nSure, it doesn\u2019t offer some of the features that programs like Adobe Reader comes with, but then again, its whole purpose is to offer you a basic PDF reader with the lowest footprint. On the negative side, though, SlimPDF Reader doesn\u2019t have a portable version, which is a bit strange for any program whose USP is its small size.\n\nPros Cons Small and lightweight No OCR option Minimal and easy to use interface\n\nNot as feature-rich Extremely fast with no bloatware\n\nAvailable for all major platforms\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows, macOS, and Linux\n\nPrice: Free\n\n7. STDU Viewer\n\nScience and Technical Documentation Utility (STDU) Viewer is a document and image viewer that comes as a tiny 2.5MB download and, supports a wide variety of file formats, ranging from PDF to TIFF and JPEG to GIF. At that size, it\u2019s the second smallest and lightest PDF viewer on this list.\n\nIn addition to these popular formats, the program can also open a whole host of file types, like, DjVu, XPS, JBIG2, FB2, TXT, e-books (ePub and Mobi), comic book archives (CBR and CBZ), TCR, PalmDoc (PDB), AZW and DCX. As for images, STDU Viewer can open BMP, PCX, PNG, WMF, EMF, and PSD alongside the two other formats mentioned above.\n\nOne of the great things about STDU Viewer is its multi-language interface support, with users able to choose between English, Russian, and French. The program has a tabbed interface and comes with just about all the features you\u2019d expect from a free document viewer including thumbnail view, rotate the page, search by text layer, etc.\n\nYou can also export a page (or part of a page) as an image and create your bookmarks. STDU viewer is free for non-commercial or educational use, but you\u2019ll need to pay up to be able to use it for commercial purposes.\n\nPros Cons Extremely simple, no-frills PDF viewer No annotation features Supports nearly all file types\n\nExtremely light weight\n\nSupports multiple languages\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows\n\nPrice: Free\n\n8. Nitro PDF Reader \u2013 Best Paid Adobe Reader Alternative\n\nImage Credit: NitroPDF\n\nNitro PDF Reader has been discontinued by the firm but it can still be used. However, if you\u2019re not sure about the security, Nitro PDF Editor can view and edit PDFs for you. It is a full-featured PDF viewer that, unlike PDF X-Change, allows users to also create PDF files from scratch. Like Foxit Reader, it also comes with an interface that resembles MS Office, and allows users to annotate, highlight, and add sticky notes to the documents you open.\n\nOne of its unique features is a split-screen view that allows users to compare two different PDF files side-by-side. The program also comes with drag-and-drop support, allowing users to quickly create new PDF file by simply dragging any document on the Nitro desktop icon.\n\nNitro PDF Reader is no longer available, but you can try out Nitro Editor for free for 14 days. If you need the PDF Reader, you can find it on third-party websites and it should work just fine. Afterward, it starts at $159.99. Overall, it is definitely a program worth checking out if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to the Adobe Reader. Pros Cons Simple and easy to use No longer available Can annotate PDFs\n\nPDF Editor is expensive Split screen view to view multiple PDFs\n\nAbility to extract images from PDFs\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows and macOS\n\nPrice: NA, Nitro PDF Editor starts at $159\n\n9. Okular \u2013 Best Adobe Reader Alternative for Linux\n\nOkular is a free and open source document viewer that comes with one of Linux\u2019s popular desktop environments KDE. The tool supports a variety of file formats including PDF, PostScrip, DjVu, TIFF, XPS, EPub, Fax, Plucker, Comic Book, Images and DVI.\n\nAlso Read: 10 Best File Manager Apps for Android\n\nUnlike most free PDF viewers on this list, Okular also supports annotations and comes with a whole bunch of tools, including the ability to e-sign which is impressive. It\u2019s also pretty customizable and has a built-in reader that can read for you. The program also allows users to select, highlight and even copy text from PDF files, provided, they include the OCR data. All in all, it\u2019s definitely one of the best cross-platform Adobe Reader alternatives. Pros Cons Free and open-source None Supports all major formats\n\nBuilt-in annotation tools\n\nDocument reader and content extraction\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows, macOS, and Linux\n\nPrice: Free\n\n10. SodaPDF\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for primarily an online PDF viewer or editor, SodaPDF will more than do the job. We don\u2019t recommend its desktop application as it may slow down your PC due to persistant notifications, which may feel like bloat. But otherwise, it\u2019s completely free online and works as it should. All you need to do is go to SofaPDF (website), upload your PDF, and check it out. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nThat said, it has decent editing features that can edit basic stuff for you. It does have OCR capabilities even in online version, and has a variety of annotation features. One of the other features of SodaPDF online is that it can also translate the text for you in 7 different languages. Overall, if you don\u2019t want yet another dedicated PDF viewer or editor app on your computer, SodaPDF is a great Adobe Reader alternative.\n\nPros Cons Free None Can translate PDFs\n\nBasic annotation tools\n\nCompletely online; No downloads required\n\nPlatform Availability: Windows and Web\n\nPrice: Free\n\nThat brings us to the end of the list. Realistically, you cannot go wrong with any PDF viewer mentioned on this list. However, if we had to pick a few, we\u2019d pick Sumatra, Okular, SlimPDF, STDU, or would just settle with browsers if we didn\u2019t have enough space.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for alternatives to other most popular software, we\u2019ve compiled lists of alternatives to Microsoft Office. Besides, there are lots of great open-source apps that you can use as alternatives to other apps, to protect your privacy so do check them out.",

            "content": "Providing Value While Still Making Money\n\nby Jack Guarnieri, Jersey Jack Pinball & PinballSales.com\n\nAn industry friend recently told me about a new FEC that priced their cranes at $7 per play on a swipe card system. By the way, that\u2019s not a play-until-you-win crane. I wonder how those will do over time.\n\nOn the other side of the price-per-play equation is the penny slot machine with its very low bar of entry. After all, they\u2019re just a penny to play, right? With a dollar slot machine, you might put in three, five or more dollars per pull of a handle (or push of a button). The penny slot offers multiple lines of play, each for a penny, and you can play 100 lines or more at a time. Your brain tricks you into thinking you\u2019re getting a lot of chances to win for \u201cjust a penny.\u201d\n\nBut if you\u2019re paying for 300 chances to win per spin, that\u2019s $3 per play. The money is the same as if you were playing the dollar machine, but the feeling is different. You might ask how you got tricked into playing with more money than you intended, but it\u2019s this breaking of the connection between the real money in your pocket and its value that\u2019s one of the main reasons why casinos use chips. It makes me wonder if it\u2019s the same reason why FECs like using player cards. (And for the record, I don\u2019t play any games at casinos.)\n\nIn a fun center, wiping out the credit on your customers\u2019 swipe cards as quickly as possible is a good way to burn them out. Did they have any fun? What prizes did they win? What kind of experience did they have? Did they find value? Will they come back again? And, what will they tell others about their experience?\n\nConsider that a lower price per play for select games could draw a wider range of players, including those who don\u2019t want to spend as much money. I subscribe to the old operator saying: \u201cI\u2019d rather make a fast nickel than a slow quarter.\u201d It could be updated, but its message rings true today at many locations.\n\nAnother school of thought is that fewer plays at higher pricing gets more revenue without as much wear and tear on the equipment. I get it. With the price of new equipment these days, you\u2019re focused on getting your ROI as quickly as possible so you naturally question how to do that when charging less to play the game.\n\nI propose an experiment. Take a game that isn\u2019t earning well and lower its price per play. If you have a card system, make sure the pricing is displayed on the screen and, ideally, also with a sticker on the game. If you see that the lower pricing creates more play on the game \u2013 and more revenue for you \u2013 explore expanding lower pricing to other underperforming games.\n\nDepending on the game, you may be able to shorten the timer on game play or, very slightly, increase the difficulty of the game. The idea isn\u2019t to frustrate the player but to challenge them while encouraging them to play again.\n\nNot everything will work at every location, but one thing is certain: your customers will welcome a game that costs less to play, especially in today\u2019s economy. Give value to your customers, and you will be rewarded in the long term with loyal players.\n\nJack Guarnieri started servicing electromechanical pinball machines in 1975 and has been involved in every phase of the amusement game business since then.

And in workplaces that often reward self-promotion and visibility, this behaviour can become as automatic as checking emails first thing in the morning.\n\nBut boomer-asking is not always about chasing a dopamine rush.\n\nSometimes, it is a strategic move.\n\nBy steering conversations back to themselves, boomer-askers subtly broadcast competence, charm or even superiority.\n\nThey weave in cues designed to invite admiration or sympathy, whether they are bragging about a past achievement or bemoaning a heavy workload.\n\nThe trouble is that when these cues are too obvious, the whole interaction can feel forced and leave colleagues feeling more used than valued.\n\nIf you notice shades of boomer-asking in your own behaviour, do not panic.\n\nThe fix is not about staying silent, but learning to sharpen your listening skills.\n\nAsk questions with genuine curiosity, not as a set-up for your own story.\n\nWhen someone shares a challenge, resist the urge to interrupt and instead follow up with questions that help them explore their experience further.\n\nLet their story take the spotlight for a while.\n\nBoomer-asking robs conversations of their natural rhythm, turning what should be a two-way exchange into a dead end.\n\nWhen someone\u2019s thoughts are cut off or redirected, the unspoken message is: \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t as important as what I have to share.\u201d\n\nOver time, this leaves colleagues wondering if the original question was ever sincere.\n\nMeaningful interactions happen when both sides feel heard, not when one person constantly dominates the discussion.\n\nWorkplace conversations thrive on reciprocity, not self-reflection disguised as curiosity.\n\nNo one enjoys dodging verbal boomerangs when they could be part of an exchange where everyone feels genuinely connected.\n\nProfessor Gary Martin is chief executive of the Australian Institute of Management WA.",

The epic film won the Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound and took home four Visual Effects Society (VES) Awards.\n\n\u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 edited by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet, Coralie Fargeat and Valentin Feron\n\n\u201cThe Substance,\u201d edited on Premiere Pro, is nominated for five Academy Awards and the Eddie Award for Best Feature Film (Comedy, Theatrical). For this film made from more than 300 hours of footage and 230 sequences with very little dialogue, the team chose Premiere Pro to build the film\u2019s dynamic rhythm.\n\nEditor J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet shared: \u201cWe primarily used Premiere Pro, which we chose for its intuitive and modern interface. Coralie and I work a lot on sound editing \u2014 and Premiere Pro is the perfect tool for this. Its flexibility and powerful features make it ideal for shaping the sound design.

Editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki worked closely with director Shiori Ito, using Premiere Pro and Frame.io, to craft this powerful story.\n\n\u201cI used Premiere Pro to edit because that\u2019s been my preference on single-editor projects for a long time,\u201d said Yamazaki. \u201cWe also used Frame.io to communicate with our colorist/VFX staff, as it\u2019s very convenient to be able to write frame-specific notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWicked\u201d \u2014 pre-visualization and texturing by Framestore\n\nThe award-winning VFX house Framestore used Adobe After Effects during pre-production for pre-visualization and Substance 3D for texturing on \u201cWicked\u201d, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\n\u201cThe Bear\u201d \u2014 edited by Joanna Naugle, ACE\n\nThe award-winning FX show scored 11 Emmys this season, including editor Joanna Naugle\u2019s win for Outstanding Picture Editing, and is nominated for the Eddie Award for Best Edited Single Camera Comedy Series.\n\nNaugle brought the chaotic world of the kitchen to life using Premiere Pro, Frame.io and After Effects: \u201cI use Adobe Premiere Pro for 100 percent of the things that I cut,\u201d said Naugle. \u201cI just love it, it\u2019s so easy to use. My presets let me jump in quickly. We used [the Premiere Pro feature] Productions on FX\u2019s \u2018The Bear\u2019 so we could all collaborate remotely while the team was shooting in Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Jinx \u2014 Part Two\u201d \u2014 Edited by David Tillman and team\n\nThis groundbreaking, Emmy-winning HBO docuseries was supported by a team of more than ten editors and assistant editors and is nominated for the Eddie for Best Edited Documentary Series.

Not only did it help us quickly transcribe archival material, but it also helped us easily make transcripts of our cuts as well, which was very helpful in the editorial process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill and Harper\u201d \u2014 Edited by Monique Zavistovski, ACE\n\nThis touching documentary, cut on Premiere Pro Productions and Frame.io, won Best Documentary at the Critics Choice Documentary Awards and is nominated for the Eddie for Best Edited Documentary (Theatrical).\n\n\u201cWe decided to use Adobe Premiere Pro\u2019s Productions feature because we had such a complex workflow,\u201d said editor Monique Zavistovski, ACE. \u201cIt was the first time I had used Productions and it was a lifesaver to be able to organize the footage into shareable, smaller projects that Hunter and I could quickly pass back and forth. Because a lot of our footage was endless hours of car conversations, Premiere\u2019s transcription feature was also a key component of our workflow. The ability to generate transcripts from within the project and utilize them immediately shaved weeks off our timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Mulaney Presents: Everybody\u2019s in L.A.\u201d \u2014 Edited by Kelly Lyon, ACE, Sean McIlraith, and Ryan McIlraith\n\nThe live talk show series featuring SNL veteran John Mulaney was edited on Premiere Pro and Frame.io and took home the Emmy for Outstanding Picture Editing for Variety Programming as well as a Critics Choice Award for Best Talk Show. Lyon is nominated for the Eddie for Best Edited Variety Talk/Sketch Show or Special.\n\n\u201cI love Frame.io. We used Frame.io to share and review cuts. Collaborators really liked being able to leave comments on the video timeline, so I would always know exactly what changes they wanted and where, said editor Kelly Lyon, ACE. \u201cWe also used Frame.io to post dailies. The writers and producers could review the largely improvised footage, flag selects and leave notes for us right in Frame.io.\u201d",

In recent years, there\u2019s been a boost of Adobe mobile apps for Androidand iPhone. However, the iPhone typically has more support for Adobe apps. But with Adobe Firefly AI tools, even budget Android phone users can access the web-based app to use new-and-upcoming AI features in Adobe. Adobe Firefly tools consist of image generators of various types, but there are plenty of ways to use Firefly from your phone.\n\nWhat is Adobe Firefly?\n\nAdobe\u2019s AI-powered hub\n\nAdobe Firefly on Macbook\n\nAdobe Firefly is the collective name for AI-powered tools in Adobe software. You might see \u201cPowered by Firefly\u201d labeling some AI tools in various software. Aside from the internal AI power, you can access Adobe Firefly as its own tool. Sort of.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t a designated app or software, free and paid Adobe users can access the Adobe Firefly web app from major browsers, computers, or mobile devices. This includes Android.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Firefly web app was redesigned in February 2025 to become a well-maintained hub of AI tools for anyone to use. Adobe Firefly\u2019s AI results are high-quality, commercially safe, and designed to be used and shared by anyone.\n\nHow to access Adobe Firefly for Android users\n\nIt\u2019s easy, as long as you have internet\n\nFirefly web app on Android browser\n\nSince Adobe Firefly isn\u2019t an app or software in the traditional sense of other Adobe tools, there\u2019s nothing you need to download. This also means that anyone with access to the internet and an updated browser can use Adobe Firefly. The Firefly web app from Android is responsive and well-designed.\n\nFind Adobe Firefly by opening your phone\u2019s browser and heading to firefly.adobe.com. You don\u2019t need to be a paying Adobe subscriber to use any of the tools, but you need a free Adobe account. Tap Sign In at the top of the screen to log in to your Adobe account. If you are a Creative Cloud subscriber, you\u2019ll see more benefits, such as a larger number of AI credits than free account users, who are limited to only 25 per month.\n\nThe tools available in the Firefly web app are not permanent. This is, perhaps, the biggest negative of this forward-thinking app. You can only access the tools while they\u2019re in beta mode or newly awaiting integration into the final homes of Adobe software. They\u2019ll become premium tools only accessible with certain paid Adobe subscriptions.\n\nWhich tools does the Adobe Firefly web app have?\n\nUp-and-coming AI tools\n\nFirefly web app text to image and text to video tools\n\nAdobe Firefly is the name of the public AI model used in all Adobe AI integrated tools. However, the features have their own descriptive names and use cases.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tools available in Firefly are in beta mode or recently implemented into software. In the latter case, they\u2019ll soon be removed from the free web app. Using Firefly\u2019s web app is a rare opportunity to access Adobe tools without the cost of an Adobe subscription.\n\nAmong the currently available tools in Firefly, you\u2019ll see previous Firefly features along with the software they\u2019re now available in, such as Generative Recolor or Text to Vector, both of which are available in Adobe Illustrator.\n\nIn February 2025, the Adobe Firefly web app offers image and video generators, as well as other AI tools. They\u2019re free to use by anyone. The current tools are:\n\nText to Image (Fast Mode)\n\nText to Video (Beta)\n\nScene to Image (Beta)\n\nTranslate Video\n\nImage to Video (Beta)\n\nTranslate Audio\n\nAs most of the tools are in beta, expect slower rendering, mistakes in generation results, or other development issues when using the tools. This is the time to use the feedback button to improve future tools.\n\nHow to use Adobe Firefly tools\n\nGenerate in the palm of your hand\n\nAdobe Firefly app image generator prompt box\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Firefly web app makes it simple and easy to use any of the tools from your phone or a computer browser. If you have a Creative Cloud account, you can access your generated results in other Adobe software to edit or add to your creative projects. Your generation history is saved in your Firefly files for access later.\n\nThe prompt-based generators are more complex than writing a prompt. Adobe provides a prompt suggestions feature to help you craft the perfect text prompt to begin with. While you can use the text prompt and rely on the default settings, using a powerful tool means you may as well benefit from all the custom options.\n\nDepending on the generator you use, you might have custom options like aspect ratio, camera angle, and style or image type. You can upload your own reference images to have more control over the results.\n\nAdobe Firefly web app edit settings\n\nThe Android version of Firefly tucks its custom menus under tabs at the bottom of each screen. Tap through them to change the settings before applying them. When generated, you can edit the results, add the result to another Adobe tool, upscale some results (like images), leave feedback, or download the result to your device.\n\nBenefit from a rare opportunity from Adobe\n\nAdobe has a reputation for out-pricing creative endeavors, but the Adobe Firefly web app is a rare opportunity to use powerful Adobe tools without paying a penny. While the opportunity is time-limited, you shouldn\u2019t waste it. Accessing Firefly from your phone means you can get a creative and helpful (and high-quality) result. While it\u2019s not built in like iPhone or Google Pixel AI tools, it\u2019s easily accessible and has zero learning curve.",

Many of Photoshop's core features are available in the free version, including generative AI that can fill gaps in an image or edit photos in layers, and there is a $7.99 subscription that adds premium features.\n\nSan Jose-based Adobe has long been a leader in design and creative software on the desktop. However, it has not found great success in translating that strength over to mobile platforms.\n\nThe competition for photo-editing apps on smartphones is fierce, and Photoshop ranked only 29th in its category in downloads in the US after its launch. At the top of the photo and video category were ByteDance's CapCut video editor, Instagram and Canva's editing app. Adobe's own Lightroom, tailored for processing photos, ranked ninth on 26 February.\n\nAdobe has made an effort to give users a robust set of tools even without signing up for a subscription, and its premium plan includes access to Photoshop on the web and additional features on mobile and iPad.\n\nThe iPhone app marks a major expansion of the company's reach and will be a test of the appeal of Adobe's artificial intelligence-powered features with a broader consumer audience.",

To channel such, formulators have employed tools ranging from emollients, humectants, occlusives and exfoliants, to actives that brighten skin, trigger autophagy, boost HA, lift and shape facial contours, mute muscle contractions, recruit microbes, etc., and combinations thereof.\n\nSomewhere in their journey, consumers realized that general health and wellness could help to pause skin in its current state, maintaining younger characteristics, slowing aging, extending its health (aka longevity) and reinforcing the capacity to defend itself. Sure, it\u2019s still anti-aging, but the concept has transcended traditional views of hiding wrinkles and spots to the point of rebuilding and regenerating skin and restoring its health.\n\nKline highlighted this in its report on four beauty concepts to watch in 2025: timeless beauty/longevity, regenerative skin care (e.g., exosomes), root revival and detox for the scalp, and next-gen sun care. Our latest edition explores innovations to advance product development in these areas.\n\nFor example, Monta\u00f1o describes a hexapeptide modeled on human skin type I collagen that activates skin biomarkers, procollagen I and hyaluronic acid release. In the Industry Insight, Ayesha Bshero, of Beekman 1802, explains how exosomes advance skin care. Also, Tavasoli, et al., test the efficacy of a standardized, non-alcoholic-extracted propolis for its anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and other effects for derm-grade skin care.\n\nLionetti and Deola discuss formulating well aging and anti-stress cosmetics, while Steventon gives an insider\u2019s view of touch for beauty, including connections with neuroscience.\n\nOn the hair front, Edouard, et al., demonstrate how combining advanced test methods including FTIR, DCFH-DA assays, cyclic fatigue and DSC confirmed the antioxidant efficacy of a multi-peptide from hydrolyzed cicer seed (chickpea) for hair health. And the Expert Opinions piece uncovers expert views on solutions for hair and scalp health.\n\nAs a bonus, Wei provides an Asia-Pacific regulatory update on cosmetic regulations. Finally, we reveal feedback from the judges on finalists for the prestigious Cosmetics & Toiletries All\u0113 Awards.\n\nWe hope our latest edition inspires advances in skin longevity and hair health; and transcends your expectations.\n\n\n\n",

You don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll need it until the time comes, and it\u2019s a huge frustration saver if you downloaded the app and are ready to open or edit documents.\n\nAdobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF\n\nAdobe\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.5\n\nDownload\n\nAdobe Photoshop Express\n\nLike Photoshop, but from your phone\n\nPhotoshop Express mobile app homepage\n\nAdobe Photoshop is one of Adobe\u2019s most well-known and loved software tools, but there isn\u2019t an exact Photoshop mobile app. While there\u2019s a Photoshop for iPad app, and you can access Photoshop Web from the browser, these experiences aren\u2019t as detailed as using Photoshop.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat\u2019s where Adobe Photoshop Express comes in. It\u2019s the perfect cross between the Photoshop desktop tool and Photoshop Elements, a less powerful version of Photoshop that doesn\u2019t require a monthly subscription.\n\nIt has plenty of image editing tools, and although you can edit videos, its focus is on imagery. Video editing is limited to adding Looks (filters) and stitching videos together.\n\nPhotoshop Express connects easily to other Adobe tools. From the app, you can open Adobe Firefly (which opens in the browser) to access new and beta AI tools from Adobe. You can also open Adobe Express from Photoshop Express, with tool options in the app like Create Logo, QR code, and Schedule to Social.\n\nIt has Quick Actions like those in Photoshop Elements. You\u2019ll find Looks, Smooth Skin, Selective Editing, Denoise, and others.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can download and use Photoshop Express for free, as well as get a Premium upgrade from $4.99 monthly for extra features, including generative AI tools. There\u2019s a 14-day free trial of Premium, or if you log in under a Creative Cloud subscription, it is included in most plans for no extra cost.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPhotoshop Express Photo Editor\n\nAdobe\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.5\n\nDownload\n\nAdobe Express Mobile\n\nYou can do it all with Express\n\nAdobe Express home with tools available\n\nAdobe Express Mobile is my favorite Adobe tool. The desktop app is a go-to of mine most days of the week. I love that my account connects between desktop and mobile, allowing me to start a project on one device and finish from another. I can benefit from desktop features but easily download and share social networks from my phone.\n\nAlthough I often look for mobile designs, if I need to access the Adobe ecosystem, I\u2019ll choose Adobe Express. It costs $9.99 to subscribe to Adobe Express Premium without an inclusive Creative Cloud plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for high-quality generative AI tools, Adobe Express Mobile should be your choice. You get huge libraries of templates, photo, video, and audio stock files, benefits from Adobe Fonts and other Adobe integration, and some of the best AI tools in the game.\n\nExpress is built with Adobe Firefly built into it. You can generate or replace images, and your results are next-level. You won\u2019t find extra fingers on your human generations, and Firefly follows text prompts sharply. You\u2019ll find generative AI, such as template generation, AI text effects, and image generation tools. Many of the built-in features have smart features.\n\nYou can edit videos pretty well in Adobe Express, and it has some great animation features. It\u2019s easy to complete your entire content creation workflow through Adobe Express without multiple other apps and tools. It includes calendars and schedulers for posting to most social platforms.\n\nAdobe Express: Videos & Photos\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdobe\n\nART & DESIGN\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.6\n\nDownload\n\nAdobe Lightroom Mobile\n\nProfessional photo editing on Android\n\nLightroom Mobile Quick Actions tool on an Android phone\n\nI\u2019m not a huge smartphone photographer, but I have a photography background. My go-to photo editing platform has always been Adobe Lightroom (Lightroom CC and Lightroom Classic), and I\u2019m grateful to have the Lightroom Mobile app when I\u2019m away from my computer.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m more likely to take photos from my phone rather than lug my heavy DSLR around. Although my photos are more casual than professional, I like the option of professional-level editing from Lightroom Mobile.\n\nSince I have a Creative Cloud subscription, I\u2019m privy to Lightroom Mobile\u2019s premium offerings. One of the coolest Premium features is the Lens Blur, so I can easily add bokeh to my smartphone photos. I also enjoy the adaptive edits, AI features, and easy-to-use interface. Creative Cloud also means I can easily share my edits from phone to computer or vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can download Lightroom Mobile for free, with many features available under the free plan.

            "content": "Adobe has recently confirmed that, after pausing their work on adding N-RAW support to their video products last year, they are finally resuming development. Support for Nikon\u2019s RAW video format should become available for Adobe users later this year.\n\nBased on intoPix\u2019s TicoRAW, Nikon\u2019s compressed RAW format first made its debut in the Nikon Z 9 with firmware V2.0 and later found its way into the Z 8 and Z6 III (which, by the way, just got a major firmware update). Overall, N-RAW has proven to be a pretty flexible format but currently suffers from one major limitation. Indeed, at the moment, the only non-linear editing software that supports it is DaVinci Resolve and Edius.\n\n\n\nIn truth, the Adobe team had already been working on integrating N-RAW support into their video products, but shortly after Nikon acquired RED, they oddly halted the development. Now, they\u2019ve reversed that decision. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nAdobe pauses work on Nikon N-RAW support (March 2024). Source: Adobe Community\n\nNikon N-RAW \u2013 coming to Adobe software later this year?\n\nJust a few weeks ago, RED included full support for Nikon N-RAW in the latest release of REDCINE-X Pro (Beta), thus allowing Nikon users to process their N-RAW clips using RED\u2019s IPP2 (Image Processing Pipeline 2) workflow chain.\n\nThe N-RAW-capable Nikon Z 9. Image credit: CineD\n\nAt the same time, RED updated their SDK (Software Development Kit) to include support for N-RAW. So, technically, this means that any third-party developer could now integrate N-RAW processing into their software, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 Adobe.\n\nThe N-RAW-capable Nikon Z6 III. Image credit: Nikon\n\nAs a result, Adobe engineers picked up right where they left off, as confirmed by Fergus Hammond, Principal Product Manager for Adobe Audio & Video, in this thread:\n\nHi all,\n\nI have good news for people following this thread: we have restarted work on adding Nikon N-RAW support to our video products. We expect to release N-RAW support later this year.\n\n\n\nFor the curious, N-RAW support is coming via an update to RED\u2019s SDK. Adobe has worked closely with RED for many years to support RED\u2019s R3D format, so we are delighted that the purchase of RED by Nikon has resulted in N-RAW support being added to the RED SDK.\n\n\n\nAs soon as N-RAW support is available in public beta, I will update this post. Fergus Hammond, Principal Product Manager for Adobe Audio & Video\n\nFor more information, please visit the original thread here.\n\nHave you ever tried shooting in Nikon N-RAW?

Generating Images With the Firefly Web App Prompt Box More Controls for Making Artwork Working With Uploaded Images Text Generation Generating Video Content Translation Editing and Sharing What Won't Firefly Do? Does Adobe Train Its AI With Your Content? Verdict: Some Bright Spots, But Room to Grow\n\nAdobe is the undisputed king of photo and design software, and that alone makes its Firefly AI image and video generator worth your attention. The web app packages some nifty tools for creating art, faux photography, or short video clips to taste in a top-notch interface, and Adobe stresses that it doesn't use your input for training. The standalone Firefly experience also goes beyond the generative features it powers within Adobe's Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator. It's a good option if you're already deep in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, though we wish it could produce legible text and let you refine creations with follow-up requests. We've yet to determine an Editors' Choice winner in this rapidly evolving category, but third-party services like OpenAI Sora and Stable Diffusion remain ahead at this point.\n\nHow Do You Get Firefly?\n\nYou can try out Firefly in its purest form at firefly.adobe.com. There, you can see all the shiniest, newest capabilities. You can also access some Firefly features in Adobe Stock, Express, InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop, as mentioned. For example, in Photoshop, you can use Firefly to replace the background of an image with an entirely new one that you describe in words. This review focuses on the standalone version of Firefly on the web.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nSpec-wise, you need ChomeOS, macOS 12 or later, or Windows 10 or later to run Firefly. Adobe doesn\u2019t mention any CPU or graphics requirements, only that you must have at least 4GB of RAM. Supported browsers include current versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. You can also run it on a mobile device running Android 9 or later and iOS 17.4 or later, but there are no mobile Firefly apps.\n\nHow Much Does Firefly Cost?\n\nSince generative AI is such an intense computational activity that requires processing on Adobe\u2019s servers, you don\u2019t get unlimited access to it. Instead, a subscription to Firefly comes with Generative Credits. Most generating actions use one credit for standard images of up to 2,000 by 2,000 pixels. For comparison, Microsoft gives you Boosts for Copilot, which speeds up image generation; after you run out of Boosts, your images come slowly.\n\nYou can use the Firefly web app for free once you create an account or with a paid Creative Cloud subscription. Adobe isn't specific about how many credits free users get, stating that it's just enough to get a feel for the capabilities. Results get a watermark, but at least the interface doesn\u2019t show ads.\n\nAdobe offers two standalone subscriptions for Firefly: Firefly Standard costs $9.99 per month ($99.99 per year) and includes 2,000 generative credits per month, which is enough to create 20 five-second videos or translate six minutes of audio and video. A Firefly Pro subscription goes for $29.99 per month ($299.99 per year). It includes 7,000 credits per month, good for 70 videos or 23 minutes of translation. The company plans to offer a Premium level for corporate use but hasn't shared details on it yet. A FAQ page shows how many credits all the different actions require.\n\nIf you subscribe to the full Creative Cloud suite, you get 1,000 credits per month. However, my account let me generate only two videos, leaving over 900 credits remaining for image generation.\n\nFirefly charges among the lowest monthly rates for a premium account among similar services. For comparison, ChatGPT requires a $20-per-month Plus account to generate videos with Sora and more than five images a day. Midjourney doesn't have a free plan at all, and its Basic Plan ($10 per month, $96 per year) lets you have just three concurrent jobs in progress and four jobs waiting in the queue at any given time. Other limitations affect how quickly the AI tool will make your artwork.\n\nOpenArt gives you 50 image credits for free and charges $14 per month ($72 per year) for its Essential plan. Stable Diffusion has a free plan with ads, watermarks, and non-priority processing (read: slow), or you can pay $10 per month ($84 per year for a Pro account), which removes the ads and watermarks and gives you 2,000 fast image generations per month. Meta AI generates images for free if you log into a Facebook account. Which of these is the best value? It depends on what features you want, but Firefly\u2019s combination of free functionality and affordable premium plans is appealing.\n\nGenerating Images With the Firefly Web App\n\nFirefly on the web can generate images based on text prompts you enter, which can describe any outlandish visual idea you get. For example, you can tell it to create a realistic photo of a reindeer on a Caribbean beach with hawks flying around and a team of huskies pulling a dogsled with a driver on the shore, as I did in testing.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nImage generation with AI continues to get faster and better. In testing, Firefly generated four images using the Firefly Image 3 model in just five seconds. Copilot (which uses Dall-E 3) and Gemini (which uses Imagen 3) both took 11 seconds to generate a single image. Firefly doesn't produce a full-resolution image upon the first request, however. For that, you need to tap the Upscale All button.\n\nThe way you word your text prompt is critical to how closely an image matches your expectations. Even when you think you have it perfect, you might see anomalies and distortions. But things are getting better. When I last tested Firefly with the dogsled scenario, it didn't include dogs in the results. I asked for (but didn\u2019t get) a dogsled driver and didn't ask for (but got) beach loungers. The birds and dogs had too many limbs, and things were facing the wrong way. In my latest tests, most of those problems are gone.\n\nPrompt Box\n\nMidjourney and Stable Diffusion helpfully include a negative prompt box to rule out things you don\u2019t want to see in your image. Firefly doesn\u2019t, and when I tried giving it a negative instruction, such as \u201cNo clouds,\u201d I still got plenty. Adding \u201cClouds\u201d to Stable Diffusion\u2019s Negative prompt box did the trick. OpenArt has a negative text box, too, but its Prompt Adherence slider, which determines how strictly the model interprets your text, is even more intriguing. Firefly doesn't have this.\n\nAfter creating your image, Firefly leaves your text in the prompt box. You can only add to it if you want to tweak the same scene. One drawback of Firefly compared with Copilot, Gemini, and Meta AI is that you can't edit the image with a follow-up text prompt. With the others, I can enter a subsequent prompt that says, \"Make it photorealistic,\" and the AIs would comply. Firefly simply produced completely new images of a photorealistic nature in this scenario.\n\nMore Controls for Making Artwork\n\nFirefly has some controls that you don\u2019t find in all AI image generators. Chief among them is the ability to select an aspect ratio. For example, you can choose to generate widescreen or vertical images, whereas Copilot, Gemini, and Meta AI stick to a square aspect ratio. Firefly's Aspect Ratio setting in the left panel has choices for Landscape (4:3), Portrait (3:4), Square (1:1), and Widescreen (16:9). Of the services I tested, ChatGPT Pro with Dall-E 3, Midjourney, OpenArt and Stable Diffusion let you specify different aspect ratios, including widescreen. ChatGPT/Dall-E lets you change the aspect ratio right in the chat prompt, and OpenArt has all the standard aspect ratios. Stable Diffusion\u2019s aspect ratio choices don't cover the standard ratios like 16:9 and so on.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nYou can also choose to use either version 2 or 3 of Firefly. Version 3 delivers more convincing images with more detail and realism, though some may still prefer the styles that the version 2 model generates.\n\nWhen you are making images in Firefly, you can choose between Art and Photo styles, as well as apply various effects. Options include Antique Photo, Bokeh, Hyper Realistic, and Pointillism. If you choose the Photo style, you get more settings specific to that image type, including Aperture, Field of View (wide-angle or telephoto, for example), and Shutter Speed. With the Art style, a good selection of mediums and textures are available in categories such as 3D, Acrylic and Oil, Architectural Sketch, Dramatic Lighting, Neon, Pencil, and Watercolor, to name just a few. But when I asked for an image in the style of Rembrandt, I got the images below, which hardly do justice to the Dutch master:\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nFirefly has a Suggestions slider that tries to fill out a prompt if you just enter a word or two. For example, I turned on the slider and wrote \u201cSun,\u201d and the creative suggestions below popped up above the prompt box. Suggestions could be useful when you need ideas for your image.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nThis feature is somewhat similar to OpenArt's Enhance Prompt feature, which tries to improve your prompt using more AI, but that works with even longer and more detailed prompts.\n\nWorking With Uploaded Images\n\nFirefly can\u2019t create an image based only on another that you upload along with a prompt. It also can't modify an image you upload. It does, however, let you upload an image to use as a reference to base the style or the composition of the result on. You can\u2019t blend two images as you can with Midjourney, though. Stable Diffusion has three self-explanatory options for using personal content: Copy Contour, Copy Pose, and Sketch to Image. OpenArt gives you several more ways to influence your result image based on a picture you upload. In this case, Firefly is more limited than those other services.\n\nRemember my not-so-successful attempt at creating an image in Rembrandt's style? After uploading an actual Rembrandt self-portrait as a reference, I got the improved result below:\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nIt\u2019s actually less convincing than when I tested the same prompt and reference image nine months ago, however. It's not going to convince art historians. For comparison, here's a side-by-side comparison using the same Rembrandt picture and prompt text in Firefly, ChatGPT 4, Stable Diffusion, and OpenArt:\n\n(Credit: Adobe/OpenAI/Stability AI/OpenArt/PCMag)\n\nStable Diffusion performed better than Firefly and ChatGPT with Dall-E 3, but OpenArt performs this task best for my money, using the SDXL model. Meta AI doesn\u2019t let you upload sample images.\n\nText Generation\n\nYou can tell Firefly to add specific text to your image in your prompt, but you might end up with a garbled mess like I did.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nI asked it to add \"Cheers to another great campaign\" in the above example. Doing this in ChatGPT and Meta AI yielded the correct text, though Gemini botched some of the words. Midjourney generates text you put in quotation marks, but OpenArt didn't do anything with text at all. In its favor, Adobe points you to Adobe Express for adding text, a more suitable tool for that task. Still, it would do well to emulate OpenArt and simply ignore text prompts, given its performance. Serious designers should stick to dedicated tools for creating text, at least for now. Someday, it could become something that AI generators do with aplomb.\n\nGenerating Video Content\n\nCurrently a beta feature, video creation from text prompts is now possible in Firefly. It can produce video clips of just five seconds at 1080p, so don't expect to make a feature film with it. For comparison, subscribers to OpenAI Sora's Pro plan can generate video clips of up to one minute. Google's Veo 2 is also capable of generating 60-second video clips, but it's still in closed beta. Each second of Firefly video deducts 20 credits from your allotment. Strengths include animals, animation, effects like fire and smoke, and landscapes. Humans? Not so much, at this point.\n\nYou can start with text alone or upload an image that you want to start your generated video clip. You choose between widescreen (16:9) and portrait (9:16) orientations.\n\nThe results are impressively sharp, unlike the fuzzy AI-generated videos you might have seen around. You can see this clarity in the video below of its output from my prompt, \"A dog swimming through a marsh with reeds and phragmites while hummingbirds fly around under a pink sky.\" My only disappointment with this result is that the hummingbirds are much larger than the actual birds:\n\nIt takes a while to generate a single five-second video clip, about 45 seconds in my tests. To test the photo-to-video capability, I uploaded a photo of a coworker on the roof of PCMag's NYC office and prompted it only to \"Make the man fly up into the sky flapping his arms.\" The result was pretty good, though the AI added wings of sorts, rather than just having him flap his arms as requested:\n\nTranslation\n\nYou can now use Firefly to Translate video and audio files. In the case of the former, you can even have the translation match the lip movements in the video (lip-syncing). The Translate Audio burns up five credits per second, and Translate & Lip Sync devours 10 credits per second. After you upload a video clip and OK the warning message that you have permission to use it, Firefly generates a transcript and gives you a choice of 17 languages or regional language options (e.g., Canadian French).\n\nA 15-second clip took about a minute to translate. The result was far from acceptable: The original untranslated voice remained, and the voice timbre didn't match the original, even though it was able to detect two different speakers. Only Enterprise subscription holders will be able to use the lip-sync capability, and my test translation was way out of sync with the speech in the video. I had better results a year ago with Wondershare Filmora's translation feature.\n\nThe Audio page of Firefly indicates that a few new dazzling features are in the works: Enhance Speech, Text to Avatar, Text to Sound Effects, and Voice to Sound Effects. You can already find some of these capabilities in video programs like CyberLink PowerDirector and Filmora.\n\nEditing and Sharing\n\nAfter Firefly generates an image, you have quite a few choices for the next steps. You can use more Adobe AI tools like Generative Fill or open it in the online version of Photoshop. Alternatively, you can have it generate another similar set of images using the same prompt or use the structure of the generated image as the basis for another new image. Surprisingly, when it comes to post-image-generation editing, Microsoft Designer does a more Adobe-like thing by highlighting objects in your created image as you hover your mouse over them. You can then blur them or punch up their colors. With Firefly, you can also send the image to Adobe Express to turn your art into a social post, complete with text and additional graphics.\n\n(Credit: Adobe/PCMag)\n\nWith created videos, your only choice is to download the result. I would like to have at least basic trimming or splitting tools. Sora has these and lets you join multiple AI clips.\n\nWhen you download or share an image you create with Firefly, Adobe applies Content Credentials metadata to indicate it is the work of AI. If you base your request on a sample you upload, the metadata indicates that as well. Adobe has long been pushing for this kind of transparency and has even established a Content Authenticity Initiative.\n\nWhat Won't Firefly Do?\n\nFirefly can produce presentable people in your results. Competitor Gemini now does this, too, though just for Advanced subscribers ($19.99 per month). You won\u2019t, however, see anything higher than G-rated in Firefly, so don\u2019t hope to create adult images. You can find specialized generators for those purposes, but Firefly is all about safety.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to include anything trademarked, either. When I asked for a group of friends drinking Coca-Cola, the resulting beverages looked more like white wine than Coke. That\u2019s because Adobe prevents copyright infringement in Firefly. The service also has, as you might expect, a policy against creating any images that are \u201charmful or offensive content that could promote violence, hate speech, or other harmful activities,\u201d including misinformation and disinformation. If you cross any of these lines (Adobe uses both machine and human reviewers to detect them), Adobe might disable your Firefly account.\n\nDoes Adobe Train Its AI With Your Content?\n\nAccording to Adobe's documentation, \u201cWe don't train on any Creative Cloud subscribers\u2019 personal content.\u201d\n\nThat said, the company is aware that some users want to train an AI with their images to, for example, match a corporate style. It's looking into options for such people. Adobe does train on images in Adobe Stock, the company\u2019s answer to services like Getty Images. This policy is in stark contrast with Meta AI and Google Gemini, which take advantage of their massive social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Google Photos, and YouTube) for training fodder. Both claim to train using only public images and videos, though.\n\nVerdict: Some Bright Spots, But Room to Grow\n\nAnyone interested in visual arts should pay attention to the quickly growing world of AI generators. No, the latest Firefly model isn't going to put most graphic designers, photographers, or video producers out of work, but it does suffice for creating whimsical visuals and has gotten better at realism (even if it's still not fully convincing). Firefly can also now generate impressive five-second video clips, too, though it's not so great at depicting humans and lacks even basic trimming and joining tools. Adobe subscribers might find Firefly helpful for their work, but competitors like OpenAI Sora and Stable Diffusion are still better at video and image generation. We haven\u2019t, however, evaluated enough products within this category to name an Editors\u2019 Choice winner.",

            "content": "538 has forecasted a lot of elections in its day, from the worlds of politics to sports to entertainment. But without a doubt, the Oscars are the most fun (probably because they're also the lowest-stakes). On Sunday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will give out its coveted annual awards, and, much like the 2024 presidential election, it's a very tough contest to predict. There's genuine suspense over who will win major categories like Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Actor, meaning that even the people who have paid attention to every twist and turn of awards season don't know what's going to happen.\n\nThankfully, we're not going into the ceremony entirely blind. Hollywood likes its award shows, and the film industry has handed out several accolades in the last several weeks \u2014 including the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Directors Guild of America Awards, Producers Guild Awards, Critics' Choice Awards and British Academy Film Awards (better known as the BAFTAs). These precursor awards serve as polls, of a sort, of the small community of film-industry insiders who vote on the Oscars. This year, those polls are all over the place; for instance, four different films won a top prize at one of those ceremonies.\n\nBut those precursor awards are also imperfect indicators, and some of them have better track records than others. Based on that history, there is at least a weak front-runner for most of the major Oscar categories \u2014 although, to be clear, there's certainly still room for an upset.\n\nBest Picture\n\nTo show you what I mean, let's break down the race for the biggest award of the night: the Oscar for Best Picture. It's been a roller-coaster campaign: First, \"The Brutalist\" and \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" won at the Golden Globes, which divides its Best Picture equivalent into a Drama category and a Musical or Comedy category. Then, \"Anora\" won the top prize at the Critics' Choice Awards, PGAs and DGA Awards. Most recently, \"Conclave\" snagged top honors at both the BAFTAs and SAG Awards.\n\nIt's possible that Hollywood's preferences have evolved over the last couple of months and \"Conclave\" is peaking at the right time. But fans of papal politics, beware: The BAFTAs and SAG Awards haven't been very good at predicting Best Picture historically. The winner of best cast in a motion picture (the top SAG Award) has gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars just 11 of the last 20 years, and the BAFTA winner has done so just eight of the last 20 times.\n\nAnd unfortunately for \"The Brutalist\" and \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Golden Globes are terrible Oscar predictors; the Drama prize has picked the eventual Best Picture winner in just six of the last 20 years, and only two winners of Best Musical or Comedy have won the Oscar over that span.\n\nInstead, the PGAs are best at predicting Best Picture, having done so in 14 of the last 20 years. This is probably because the PGAs' voting rules are very similar to the Oscars': Specifically, they both nominate 10 films rather than five,* and they are also the only organizations that use ranked-choice voting to crown winners. The DGA Awards and Critics' Choice Awards also have decent track records of picking Best Picture.\n\nThis, of course, is great news for \"Anora,\" which won the three most accurate precursor prizes. As a result, most quantitative-minded Oscar pundits are picking it to win Best Picture. Former 538 culture writer Walt Hickey gives films points based on each precursor prize they win (more predictive precursors are worth more points), and his model says \"Anora\" leads \"Conclave\" 236 points to 118. Ben Zauzmer, who has developed a probabilistic Oscars model for The Hollywood Reporter, is giving \"Anora\" a 52-in-100 chance of winning Best Picture, while \"Conclave\" has only a 15-in-100 chance. In other words, \"Anora\" is much more likely than any other individual film to win Best Picture, but there's still about a 50-50 chance of an upset.\n\nBest Director\n\nWe can do the same sort of exercise with Best Director, another category that's up in the air on Sunday night. Brady Corbet, the director of \"The Brutalist,\" won two of the big precursor awards for this category: the Golden Globe and the BAFTA. Meanwhile, Sean Baker, who directed \"Anora,\" took home the DGA Award. (The Critics' Choice Award, the last major precursor prize in this category, went to \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu, who isn't nominated at the Oscars.)\n\nYou might think that two wins are more meaningful than one, but take a look at these awards' track records. The winner of the DGA Award has gone on to win the Best Director Oscar a whopping 18 of the last 20 years. By contrast, the BAFTAs and Golden Globes have both been merely OK at predicting this award.\n\nAs a result, prognosticators consider this a tight race. In Hickey's model, Corbet just edges out Baker, 188 points to 174. On the other hand, Zauzmer gives a slight edge to Baker, who has a 36-in-100 chance to Corbet's 30-in-100.\n\nBest Actress\n\nDemi Moore, the star of \"The Substance,\" has been considered the front-runner for Best Actress for most of awards season, and she took home three major precursors: the Golden Globe, Critics' Choice Award and SAG Award.** However, Mikey Madison, who plays the title role in \"Anora,\" pulled off an upset at the BAFTAs.\n\nAnd unlike Best Picture and Best Director, the acting categories at the Oscars often follow the BAFTAs' cue. The BAFTAs and the Oscars have aligned on Best Actress in 15 of the last 20 years \u2014 including, memorably, last year, when the BAFTAs foreshadowed Emma Stone's surprise Oscar win over Lily Gladstone.\n\nThe SAG Awards are still pretty good at picking the Best Actress Oscar winner, though, so Moore is still very much in this thing. In Hickey's model, Madison barely leads Moore, 169 points to 166. Meanwhile, Zauzmer's model still has Moore as the favorite with a 52-in-100 chance; Madison is at 22-in-100.\n\nBest Actor\n\nSimilarly, everyone assumed the Best Actor Oscar was Adrien Brody's to lose for his performance in \"The Brutalist.\" He racked up the BAFTA, the Critics' Choice Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama. Then, out of left field, the SAG Awards bestowed their Best Actor prize on Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet of \"A Complete Unknown.\"\n\nThis poses a real puzzle: Both the SAG Awards and BAFTAs are excellent at picking the Oscar winner for Best Actor, having done so in 18 and 16 of the last 20 years, respectively. In other words, somebody's going to be wrong.\n\nThe tie is broken by the fact that the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama and the Critics' Choice Award also have strong track records: Each has gone 15-for-20 in this category since 2005. As a result, quantitative models are still pretty confident that Brody is going to win. Hickey gives Brody a 273-186 lead in points, while Zauzmer calculates Brody has a 69-in-100 chance.\n\nBest Supporting Actress and Actor\n\nTwo categories for which you won't have to be on the edge of your seat on Sunday night are Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor. There's no need to go through the predictive track record of the various precursor awards here \u2014 because Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Kieran Culkin have swept them at every major ceremony.\n\nAs a result, they are virtual locks to prevail at the Oscars too. Hickey gives Salda\u00f1a 357 out of 545 total points for her performance in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" and Culkin has amassed 367 of 632 total points for his turn in \"A Real Pain.\" And in Zauzmer's model, Salda\u00f1a has an 89-in-100 chance to win, while Culkin has an 88-in-100 chance.\n\nFootnotes\n\n*The Oscars and PGAs used to have five Best Picture nominees too, but both organizations expanded to 10 in 2009. However, from 2011 to 2021, the Academy used a nomination system that could have resulted in anywhere from five to 10 nominees, depending on how many films got enough nomination votes \u2014 although in practice, it was always eight or nine.\n\n**At the Golden Globes, she specifically won Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. Fernanda Torres, of \"I'm Still Here,\" won Best Actress in a Drama.",

Total impacts of the cuts are expected to be finalized by May 14, district leaders said.\n\nPreliminary pink slips will go out on March 15, as required by California law, and if nothing changes, employees will receive a final layoff notice in May.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, we want to recognize that all of our employees are incredibly valuable members of our community and add value to our district, schools, and programs,\u201d said Superintendent Cindy Friberg, who is a co-superintendent of the district along with Superintendent Michele Gochberg.\n\n\u201cOne of the most difficult parts of our work as a district is to make budget decisions about work that is truly based on relationships and heart, and there are no reductions that are not felt,\u201d Friberg said.\n\nBut some community members and employee union representatives say the goal of keeping budget cuts far from students was not reached, and questioned the logic of making cuts to so many classified and certificated positions while the district keeps two superintendents on its payroll, whose pay amounts to $221,000 each per year.\n\n\u201cAs a community member, it\u2019s really disheartening that we voted board members in that made promises to look out for what was in the best interest of our students and teachers and they\u2019re making decisions that I don\u2019t feel like are in the best interest,\u201d said Kristin Isaacs, who is Petaluma regional representative with the California School Employees Association and lives in the Old Adobe district area.\n\nIsaacs added, \u201cWhen you take away classroom aides that work directly with students, in favor of keeping two superintendents who are the furthest away from students, you\u2019re not keeping your commitment to us.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials responded by saying that keeping both superintendents is not only necessary but cost effective.\n\n\u201cThe decision to maintain the two co-superintendents was guided by the district\u2019s strategic priorities and the necessity for focused leadership in key areas,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cBy absorbing the roles of additional department directors within the district, the co-superintendents structure saves approximately $160,000 a year for the district.\u201d\n\nOut of the 300 staff employed in the district, Alvarez said, there are only eight administrators: a principal at each of the five elementary schools, a program specialist who oversees special education services, and the two superintendents.\n\n\u201cUnlike similarly sized districts, we do not have a director of human resources, student services, or curriculum,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, when the district moved to the co-superintendent structure, the director of curriculum and the director of student services positions were eliminated and moved to be included in the superintendents\u2019 roles.\n\n\u201cThe district has experienced consistency and continuity in leadership, in contrast to recent years before the current structure,\u201d Friberg said.\n\nThe district currently serves about 1,750 students and 300 staff members.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) is involved in the broad-based AI business mainly via its development of AI-powered tools and technologies that are focused on enhancing creativity and productivity. Adobe Firefly is a suite of generative AI-powered features for creating image content. Analyst Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock with a $660.00 price objective. As per the analyst, the rollout of the Firefly Video model with its tiered pricing remains a strategic step towards expanding user adoption and improving monetization opportunities as Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s functionality grows. This pricing strategy can fuel adoption and retention while, at the same time, helps in maintaining competitive advantages in areas such as copyright safety and integration with existing Adobe products.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s significant investments in AI technology, mainly via its Firefly platform, can open up new revenue streams and enhance its addressable market. Through the integration of AI capabilities across its product suite, the company will be able to enhance the value proposition of its existing offerings and attract new users. Overall, Adobe Inc.

Martin Lopez from the Texas Historical Commission shared insights into the home's rich history and cultural significance.\n\n\"The Magoffin Home is one of the oldest adobe structures still standing in the city,\" Lopez said. \"We are lucky to be the only historic house museum here in El Paso, showcasing the legacy of three generations of Magoffins who helped build the city as we know it today.\"\n\nBuilt in 1877, the home originally featured seven rooms, with additional rooms added in 1880. Lopez explained, \"Adobe is essentially a mud brick, [which is basically what covers our walls here] and our walls are so thick that noise doesn't travel through them.\"\n\nThe Magoffin Home celebrates the diverse cultural heritage of El Paso, highlighting Irish, American, Spanish, and Mexican lineages. \"We like to showcase how the city is a mix of different cultures, much like the Magoffin family was back in their day,\" Lopez said.\n\nVisitors often find themselves surrounded in nostalgia, with rooms that evoke memories of grandparents' homes. However, preserving such a historic structure comes with challenges. \"Being an adobe structure, they're not very popular nowadays,\" Lopez noted.\n\nDespite the challenges of preserving an adobe structure, the home continues to offer various programs, including yoga, historical cooking classes, and family story time.\n\nFor those wishing to experience the Magoffin Home before its temporary closure, Lopez advised visiting before June 28 and staying informed about future programming through and .\n\nDon't miss your chance to experience the charm of the Magoffin Home before it undergoes its next chapter of restoration.",

Adobe stock dipped despite the news.\n\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company launched its Photoshop app for Apple (AAPL) iOS devices on Tuesday. A version for Google Android devices is coming in a couple of months, Adobe said. The company also is expanding its web-based Photoshop offering.\n\nAdobe previously only offered limited photo-editing tools on mobile devices through its Photoshop Express app. The new app includes generative artificial intelligence capabilities from Adobe Firefly technology, such as smart object erasing and adding objects to images.\n\nAdobe's release of Photoshop for mobile devices comes as the company faces increased competition in photo-editing software from Canva and other rivals.\n\nAdobe's new Photoshop app targets new and existing users who want the ability to make edits from anywhere and access their work and start new projects on the go.\n\nPremium upgrades from the free Photoshop app cost $7.99 a month or $69.99 annually. The premium version includes access to the web-based Photoshop app, advanced features and 100 gigabytes of storage (vs. 5 gigabytes for free users).\n\nAdobe has seamlessly integrated its mobile and web apps so creators can work on the same project across different devices. The web-based app has expanded availability across browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. With the update, Adobe added support for Apple's Safari browser.\n\nAdobe Stock Is In A Funk\n\nOn the stock market today, Adobe stock dipped 0.2% to close at 443.41. Adobe stock has been in a downtrend since September.\n\n\"Photoshop's new mobile and web apps unlock next-generation creativity, empowering creators to bring to life gorgeous photos, rich graphics and incredible art anytime, anywhere,\" Ashley Still, senior vice president, digital media at Adobe, said in a news release.\n\nIn an interview with Investor's Business Daily, Still said Photoshop users have been clamoring for a full-featured mobile app.\n\n\"Creators have been asking us for this for years,\" she said. Younger tech users often like to start projects on their smartphones because they grew up in the mobile age, Still said.\n\nThe freemium business model is a good way to onboard new customers, she said. Adobe has other freemium apps like Acrobat and Lightroom, Still said.\n\nOn Monday, Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick reiterated his hold rating on Adobe stock with a price target of 475.\n\nHe noted that Adobe faces challenges from small and medium businesses using competing generative AI tools such as Midjourney for making images and video. This has made Adobe more reliant on larger, enterprise customers.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nApple Building AI Server Factory In Texas As It Looks To Appease Trump\n\nAdobe Releases Generative AI Video Model, Claims Key Advantage\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open",

Adobe hasn\u2019t mentioned if it has anything in store for Photoshop Express, which currently still provides a more affordable $4.99 monthly premium tier subscription.\n\nIt\u2019ll be confusing if Adobe plans to support both apps simultaneously, especially as it also has another similarly named editing platform called Adobe Express available on mobile. Rebooting Photoshop on mobile is a welcome and unsurprising move, however. Photoshop Express, while useful for quick edits and throwing together social media graphics, never truly felt like Photoshop.\n\nEditing features include Adobe\u2019s AI removal and replacement tools.

The company plans to launch a Photoshop for Android app later this year.\n\nWith the new Photoshop for iPhone app, users can access both free and paid features through a mobile-friendly design that\u2019s accessible on the go. The app offers a similar set of editing tools as the desktop version, including layering and masking, but optimized for use on mobile screens. Photoshop for iPhone also integrates with Photoshop on the web, for a fee.\n\nFor users who want access to the app\u2019s premium features and Photoshop on the web, Adobe launched a $7.99 monthly subscription plan. All current Photoshop paid plans already include access to Photoshop on mobile, Adobe says.\n\nImage Credits:Adobe\n\nBy bringing Photoshop to mobile, Adobe is looking to attract new users, especially younger ones who are used to using their phones for creative purposes.\n\nIn its announcement, Adobe says it built the app \u201cfrom the ground up to welcome a new generation of image and design enthusiasts to the limitless potential of Photoshop.\u201d\n\nThe app also allows the company to compete with popular editing apps, such as Snapseed, Picsart, and even Canva mobile.\n\nAs for people who already use Photoshop on desktop, the web, and iPad, the new app allows them to make edits anywhere and work across devices.\n\nFree users can combine and blend images with Photoshop\u2019s core tools, including selections, layers, and masks. They can also remove, recolor, or replace parts of an image with the \u201cTap Select\u201d tool. Plus, they can access removal tools like the \u201cSpot Healing Brush,\u201d and utilize generative AI tools powered by Adobe Firefly, including \u201cGenerative Fill\u201d and \u201cGenerative Expand.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Adobe\n\nIn addition, they can access hundreds of thousands of free Adobe Stock assets. Free users can also navigate across workflows thanks to a direct integration with Adobe Express, Adobe Fresco, and Adobe Lightroom.\n\nPaid users can transition from Photoshop mobile to Photoshop on the web to allow for added precision and control. They\u2019ll also get access to additional Firefly-powered AI tools, including \u201cGenerate Similar\u201d and \u201cReference Image.\u201d\n\nPlus, they\u2019ll gain access to more than 20,000 fonts, along with the ability to import additional options.\n\nOther premium features include \u201cObject Select,\u201d which lets you make precise selections, and \u201cMagic Wand,\u201d a tool that allows you to isolate objects and make targeted adjustments. Paid users can also remove distractions with \u201cRemove Tool,\u201d hide unwanted objects with \u201cClone Stamp,\u201d and fill portions of an image with \u201cContent-Aware Fill.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Adobe\n\nThey have the option to lighten or darken parts of an image, too, and use advanced blend modes that allow them to control transparency and add unique styles to images.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time talking to creatives and creators, especially the new generation of creators who are very comfortable with phones, and tried to understand their unique use cases on mobile devices,\u201d said Shambhavi Kadam, senior director of product management at Adobe Photoshop, during a briefing with TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we took that feedback and built it into the product to make sure that it worked really well for these users.\u201d\n\nKadam said that early testers of the app used it to create digital art, mood boards, podcast art, album cover art, fashion lookbooks, video thumbnails, memes, and more.\n\nPhotoshop on iPhone is generally available worldwide in the Apple App Store today.",

            "content": "It's 2025, Adobe's iconic photo editor Photoshop just celebrated its 35th birthday and we finally have a true Photoshop mobile app. Based on what we saw at Adobe's preview in New York this week, the new Photoshop iPhone app is something new altogether -- not a shrunken version of the industry-standard desktop app, nor a basic upgrade from the current Photoshop Express. It's a surprising evolution of the program that thousands of creators use every day.\n\nAdobe has been working on Photoshop-branded mobile apps for over 15 years, launching and dropping products like Photoshop Express and Photoshop Touch along the way. There have been other Adobe mobile apps that've picked up steam and fulfilled different needs, too. Raw camera photographers got Lightroom's mobile app back in 2017. Two years later in 2019, Adobe launched Fresco, its mobile painting and drawing app which started on iPad and subsequently expanded to the iPhone. But for creators who favor Photoshop above all else, there's been something of a Photoshop-sized hole that none of these other mobile apps have been able to fill, until now.\n\nThe iOS Photoshop app is available globally today, free with a basic feature set or with full features through the new $8 a month app-plus-Photoshop-web subscription ($70 a year). An Android app is coming later this year, the company said in its press release. The app will also be included with other Photoshop-inclusive plans, such as the Photography plan or Creative Cloud All Apps. The files are supported across all the platforms.\n\nWhile many of the features you know and love about Photoshop are present in the app, the iOS app is still a radical break from what longtime users will think of as traditional Photoshop, offering a more Photoshop Elements-like vibe. That makes sense, as Adobe says the app is designed for the \"next generation of creators\" who find the phone a more convenient device for work. Some research points to younger folks, like Gen Z and Alpha, as being more mobile-inclined, but the professionals that make up the majority of Photoshop's users might not enjoy the pared-down experience. On the flip side, the app could also offer a less intimidating pathway into Photoshop for creators who might be overwhelmed by the desktop or web's feature-packed interface.\n\nAs with any mobile app, its shortcomings may be overlooked due to convenience. Adobe views the app as a bridge to other Photoshop versions, with more advanced features on the web and an even greater step up on desktop. Here's everything you can expect to see with the new Photoshop iPhone app.\n\nWatch this: Adobe Photoshop Launches Mobile App for iPhone: First Look 00:46\n\nWhat's old is new again (and other new things)\n\nVeteran Photoshop users will see a lot of familiar territory when they first open the app, from layers to masking and all the usual retouching tools. But the built-for-mobile UI will still put professional users on a learning curve.\n\nTap Select on the Photoshop iPhone app Katelyn Chedraoui/CNET\n\nOne of the biggest new features in the Photoshop app is the Tap Select tool. Photoshop may not seem to need yet another selection tool (remember the joke in the Barbie movie about having too many?), but it's a useful addition for working on a smaller screen and workspace. Tap Select works just like it sounds -- it analyzes your project, then identifies and highlights all the distinct objects in the image. You can then tap to select multiple objects from the thumbnails displayed in a row at the bottom, masking and editing them as needed.\n\nYour iPhone app is synced with your Adobe account so you can pull photos from Lightroom or paintings and sketches from Fresco to edit in the mobile app. If you're starting a brand new project, you can also use Adobe's Firefly AI models to generate AI images or pull from the Adobe Stock free collection (no need to sign in, manually download and license). And like every other version of Photoshop, the mobile app is loaded with Adobe's generative AI-powered tools, including the popular Photoshop Generative Fill.\n\nThe paid version unlocks additional editing tools like the magic wand and spot healing, along with advanced web features such as AI-based Generate Similar, Reference Image, a more precise Object Select tool and more.\n\nEvolving Photoshop for the small screen\n\nThe launch of the Photoshop mobile app comes at a time when photo editing software and mobile devices are all getting AI makeovers. Over the past few years, Adobe has gone all in on AI, to the dismay of some wary creators. Most of Adobe's creative products have gotten major AI-powered upgrades, whether it's tools to extend video clips in Premiere Pro or help erasing wires and cables in Photoshop.\n\nAdobe shows no signs of slowing down; the public beta of its AI video generator debuted earlier this month. At the same time, smartphone makers like Apple, Samsung and Google have loaded up their newest devices with all kinds of AI. Some of these mobile AI programs include photo editing tools, like Apple Intelligence's image playground and clean-up tool. Plus, photo editing has plenty of competition. Apps like Canva and Photopea may not match Adobe's full feature set, but they offer enough that switching may not be worth it unless you're already invested in Adobe's ecosystem.\n\nThe Photoshop iPhone app is certainly overdue, fills a niche in Adobe's product line and gives its usual users a more convenient option. But it'll be interesting to see whether the \"next generation\" of creators Adobe is chasing will gravitate toward the new Photoshop app, one of its many competitors or try their hand at their on-device, AI-upgraded photo editing tools.",

            "content": "Could San Luis Obispo lose ownership of Canet Adobe?\n\nFebruary 24, 2025\n\nBy KAREN VELIE\n\nThe City of San Luis Obispo plans to build a tiny home village for low-income people at the site of the historical Canet Adobe. The lofty goal raises a host of questions that could result in legal action against the city and the loss of the property.\n\nIs the city violating an agreement to utilize the property for parks and recreational services? Has the city failed to properly maintain the property? Because of its alleged violations, could the previous owner\u2019s heirs take the property back?\n\nMore than 40 years ago, Mary Gail Black donated 466 Dana Street to the city with the requirement the city maintain the property for park and recreational services. However, if the city were to renege on its word, Black\u2019s heirs have a right to take ownership of the property, according to a July 6, 1989 grant deed.\n\nThe Canet Adobe, one of SLO County\u2019s oldest structures\n\nLocated on Dana Street alongside Stenner Creek, the Canet Adobe, also known as the Rosa Butron de Canet Adobe, was built circa 1845. It is one of the oldest structures in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nWithout a local newspaper, community members would nail legal notices on a wall at the Canet Adobe in the 1850s and the early 1860s.\n\nIn the 1920s, Black and Midred Waterman moved into the Canet Adobe. At that time, Black worked as a reporter for the The San Luis Obispo Daily Telegram.\n\nThe couple lived together in the adobe until Waterman passed away in 1969.\n\nIn 1988, Black offered to bequeath the property to the City of San Luis Obispo with multiple strings attached. In addition to maintaining the property for parks and recreational services, Black required the city fix the roof, perform biweekly gardening and tree trimming services, pay the taxes, pay the utilities, pay for insurance and allow her to live undisturbed at the property until her death.\n\nShe also required the park\u2019s name to include Waterman in honor of her former partner.\n\nBlack passed away on July 30, 1989 at 91 years old. The city then boarded up the adobe and primarily ignored the property.\n\nSan Luis Obispo seeks help restoring and maintaining the Canet Adobe property\n\nMore than 30 years after taking ownership of 466 Dana Street, in 2020, the city issued a solicitation \u201cfor community partners that may be interested in working with the city towards restoration, adaptive reuse, and long-term stewardship of the Rosa Butron de Canet Adobe.\u201d\n\nSmart Share Housing Solutions proposed placing 20 tiny homes, ranging in size from 220 to 264 square feet, on the property to serve low and very low income people. The city accepted the offer.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with Black\u2019s requirements, the city plans to provide public access hours in which community members can view the historic adobe while naming the low-income housing project Waterman Village.\n\nEven so, neighbors, property owners and descendants of both Black and Waterman argue Black donated the property to be used solely for park and recreation uses.\n\nAware of the 1988 SLO City Council resolution that 466 Dana would be reserved for park and recreational use, Steve Barasch bought a neighboring property.\n\n\u201cI bought the property on the assurance the neighboring property would become a public park,\u201d Barasch said. \u201cPublic trust in the city has been shattered.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2024, the San Luis Obispo Property and Business Owners Association, Barasch, another neighboring property owner, the member of a local group, and a descendant of Waterman and a descendant of Black appealed the Waterman Village project.\n\n\u201cThere is a restrictive covenant in the original deed requiring the 466 Dana Street property to be used solely as a park or for recreational uses,\u201d according to the appeal. Any other use, \u201cexceeds the authorized powers of a city and therefore cannot be enforced in any court.\u201d\n\nIf the city fails to abide by the \u201ccovenants and conditions\u201d in the grant deed, it forfeits title to the property, at which time it would revert to the previous owner\u2019s descendants, according to the grant deed.\n\nFive of Black and Waterman\u2019s descendants have already asked that city to return the property.\n\nThe San Luis Obispo City Council will hold a hearing on the Waterman Village appeal at 5:30 p.m. on March 4.\n\nBecause we believe the public needs the facts, the truth, CalCoastNews has not put up a paywall because it limits readership.

Seamlessly integrating with Premiere Pro and more, AE is packed with Hollywood-grade tools that have been used in loads of big budget movies and if you're serious about creating eye-catching visual effects, I strongly recommend learning it at some point as it's effectively the industry-standard software at this stage. But After Effects isn't the only option out there, so I've rounded up all the top alternatives to After Effects you can get right now. For our testing, we explored the user experience, visual effect options, and performance and rendering to see how each alternative app compares to Adobe After Effects.\n\nI have two personal favorites when it comes to the best After Effects alternatives. DaVinci Resolve's Fusion is a very powerful, professional VFX tool that's free, while HitFilm Pro offers an incredibly user-friendly take on visual effects. Both also include some of the best video editing software we've reviewed, so unlike with AE, you get the complete content creation package.\n\nBest Adobe After Effects alternative overall\n\n(Image credit: Blackmagicdesign)\n\nBlackmagic Design\u2019s Fusion is an in-depth visual effects workspace. And the long list of Hollywood productions it\u2019s been used on tells you all you need to know about the strength of its features, which include advanced VR and 3D compositing.\n\nIn Fusion\u2019s node-based effects workspace, you can connect various effects and filters together through a visual web of nodes. That pro-level system can appear complex to newcomers. Like After Effects, this free editing software has a steeper learning curve, which takes some time to master. But once you\u2019ve got used to it, it\u2019s a very efficient way to build up combinations of effects.\n\nFusion is built into the stellar DaVinci Resolve, Blackmagic\u2019s all-in-one post-production program. Like HitFilm Pro, you\u2019re free to edit your project in Resolve\u2019s editing workspace, then click the tabs bar to switch over to Fusion and add effects.\n\nThe best thing about this After Effects alternative is that the standard DaVinci Resolve 18 suite is completely free. For some advanced features, such as faster network-based rendering, the premium version, simply called Fusion 18, costs a one-off fee of $295.\n\nRead our full DaVinci Resolve review.\n\nBest general Adobe After Effects alternative platform\n\n(Image credit: FXhome)\n\nHitFilm Pro offers the ability to edit videos and add compositions in a single tool. You won\u2019t need to switch programs, like you do between AE and Premiere Pro, leading to smoother, more efficient workflows.\n\nSince you\u2019re working within one app, effects are applied onto a non-linear editing timeline, compared to AE\u2019s layer-based system. This makes it easier to learn for those already used to non-linear editing.\n\nAnd the two-in-one nature of HitFilm Pro doesn\u2019t mean that the effects features are any less deep. When it comes to VFX toolkits, this is a capable rival to After Effects.\n\nHitFilm Pro\u2019s developers claim it has \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest VFX software toolkit\u201d. It lives up to that boast, making it one of the best Adobe After Effects alternatives. Some of the best tools include advanced 2D and 3D motion tracking, world-leading particle effects, an excellent chroma key, and over 875 VFX presets.\n\nPrice of admission is admittedly high. The $349 / \u00a3308.86 price tag likely to sway casual and rookie effects artists. That said, this is a one-off fee rather than a subscription. There\u2019s also a free demo version available that has all the features and no time limit, but exports are given a watermark.\n\nYou can also try HitFilm - the FXHome's free video editing software, which includes a handful of free VFX tools.\n\nRead our full HitFilm Pro review .\n\nBest After Effects alternative for Mac\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\n3. Apple Motion A top choice for Final Cut Pro editors Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE Reasons to buy + Works great with Final Cut Pro + Great title design features + Easy to learn Reasons to avoid - Lacks depth of After Effects - Mac only\n\nApple Motion, Apple\u2019s Mac-only visual effects software, can\u2019t match Adobe After Effects in advanced functionality. It\u2019s simple, limited, and functional. But it pairs superbly well with Final Cut Pro - you can see how Apple's video editor compares to its top rival in our guide to Adobe Premiere Pro vs Apple Final Cut Pro.\n\nMotion features the silky smooth experience you\u2019d expect from the always aesthetically pleasing Apple. Running on macOS, Motion is optimized for Apple hardware. In operation, the easy-flowing interface makes it one of the best alternatives to After Effects if you want a program that\u2019s by far easier to learn.\n\nPower users will delight in the faster rendering times compared to Adobe\u2019s special effects app.\n\nWhile it lacks the same depth of functionality, falling short when it comes to advanced compositing, for example, the VFX tool still manages to pack some impressive features. Not to be missed is the very comprehensive text design & animation tools.\n\nMotion is available for an affordable one-off fee of $49.99. This gives you the software plus any future updates for a lower cost than a three-month After Effects subscription.\n\nBest alternative to After Effects for animators\n\n(Image credit: Blender)\n\n4. Blender Perfect for 3D animation Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Open-source + Great for 3D animation Reasons to avoid - Less suited to 2D effects\n\nOpen-source, free alternative to After Effects Blender is tailored to 3D animation. It supports the whole pipeline of 3D modeling, sculpting, animation, compositing, and editing.\n\nBlender\u2019s toolset for designing and animating characters enables a very impressive level of control. However, when it comes to applying visual effects on top of the animations, it\u2019s not the best alternative - After Effects has a depth to it unmatched by Blender.\n\nAs a node-based VFX tool, the learning curve is steep and the process slow. It can\u2019t handle 2D graphics or elements like animated text like AE. But there is an extremely supportive online community always willing to help with any issues you might face. The official Blender training hub also houses online courses and workshops led by experts.\n\nThat\u2019s the only price animators pay for free 3D modeling software that in some ways is a much more powerful alternative to After Effects.\n\nSee what our sister site Creative Bloq thought in their Blender review\n\nBest open-source Adobe After Effects alternative\n\n(Image credit: Natron)\n\n5. Natron An open-source alternative for VFX Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE Reasons to buy + Open-source + Good masking and keying tools Reasons to avoid - Poor motion graphics tools - Slow development\n\nNatron is a comprehensive open-source VFX program, ideal for innovative creatives on a budget looking for free Adobe After Effects alternatives.\n\nFocusing on 2D and 2.5D effects, Natron delivers professional results through useful features, including powerful keying tools, flexible rotoscoping, and unlimited masks and mattes. Further boosting its toolkit are the wide range of community-created plug-ins available.\n\nHowever, the node-based visual effects software isn\u2019t built to tackle motion graphics or 3D tools. Development has been undeniably sluggish over the past few years, with no recent major updates. It\u2019s not as stable as the best Adobe After Effects alternatives like HitFilm Pro and Fusion. Some performance issues have been reported, too.\n\nBut it is free. It is powerful. It is a capable open-source alternative to After Effects. If you need a professional-grade, 2D node-based editor, Natron is a great choice.\n\nBest alternative to After Effects for beginners\n\n(Image credit: Wondershare)\n\n6. FilmoraPro A great place to start if you're new to FX Today's Best Deals VISIT WEBSITE Reasons to buy + Easy user experience + Good for low-end PCs and laptops + Ideal for YouTubers and streamers Reasons to avoid - Not industry-grade - Arguably too simple\n\nFilmoraPro is one of the best alternatives to After Effects, thanks to a decent set of VFX and motion graphics tools.\n\nLike Wondershare\u2019s consumer-level video editor Filmora . FilmoraPro\u2019s drag-and-drop interface is simple and intuitive. You\u2019ll have no problem placing effects on the timeline, and control key A/V elements, from noise reduction to color correction.\n\nThat simplicity is deceptive, though. As the name suggests, this is a VFX app designed for professionals. While it\u2019s good for beginners, it\u2019s perfect for intermediate editors and visual effects artists looking to hone their craft.\n\nThe quality won\u2019t win any Oscars for professionalism, but it\u2019s a good choice of video editor for YouTubers and indie filmmakers just starting out. Streamers will also get use from FilmoraPro, thanks to the built-in screen recorder.\n\nFilmoraPro is available for a one-time purchase of $149.99 - ideal if you\u2019re looking for After Effects alternatives to avoid paying a subscription. Commercial licenses are also available, starting at $155.88 per user per year.\n\nHardware requirements are fairly modest for a visual effects tool. Your rig doesn\u2019t have to be the best video editing computer to create impressive visual effects, making it one of the best Adobe After Effects alternatives for low-end PCs\n\nBest After Effects alternative for professionals\n\n(Image credit: Autodesk)\n\n7. Autodesk Smoke A professional choice with a steep learning curve Today's Best Deals Check Amazon VISIT WEBSITE Reasons to buy + Professional-grade results + Visual effects and editing app + Node-based and timeline-based Reasons to avoid - Expensive - Mac-only\n\nSmoke is a Mac-only video effects software that blends timeline- and node-based editing for increased productivity and a more well-rounded workflow.\n\nThe user-friendly editor lets you add post-production polish. The high-quality kit includes VFX essentials like keying, compositing, color correction, and 3D effects.\n\nAutodesk, the developer behind Smoke, is also responsible for some of the best architecture software. This is a company adept at creating top-quality, professional-grade graphic design tools for SMEs and enterprises.\n\nThe cost reflects this. Smoke costs $225 a month or $1785 a year. And where there\u2019s Smoke, there\u2019s\u2026Flame - with seamless integration with Autodesk\u2019s 3D visual effects suite.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a top-tier VFX app, results are impressive, rivaling any of the best Adobe After Effects alternatives.\n\nPricey and professional. If it\u2019s in your budget, Smoke could set your world on fire.\n\nBest Adobe After Effects alternatives: FAQs\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro vs Adobe After Effects: what\u2019s the difference? Adobe Premiere Pro vs Adobe After Effects isn\u2019t quite the right way to think about these two video post-production tools. There are some similarities between Adobe\u2019s industry-standard creative programs - with both earning 5-stars in our hands-on reviews. The tools are incredibly powerful, letting content creators easily cut clips and add effects thanks to that easy user experience Adobe excels at. And both deliver exceptional professional polish to video projects. What\u2019s the difference between Premiere Pro and After Effects? Adobe Premiere Pro is video editing software for editors. Adobe After Effects is VFX software, used by designers and artists to add special effects to shot footage. The two tools are best deployed in different parts of the post-production process. Crucially, though, Adobe has designed Premiere Pro and After Effects to work seamlessly together, creating a more efficient workflow for content creators and film & TV professionals who use multiple Adobe Creative Cloud apps.\n\nHow to choose the best Adobe After Effects alternative for you\n\nWhen choosing which alternative to Adobe After Effects is best, start by determining your VFX skills, and how you\u2019ll use the tool. Professional-grade visual effects software offers industry-standard effects, but beginners and enthusiasts may want to start with a simpler, or less expensive option.\n\nFinding the right tool for the right platform is important - particularly if you favor a particular video editing tool, such as Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro. You\u2019ll also need to decide if you want the full visual effects suite, or you need high-performance in a specific area, such as 3D animation. Don't ignore additional extras and nice-to-have's, like those apps boasting the best screen recorders.\n\nIf you\u2019re experienced with the Adobe stack, look for products that mirror After Effects - particularly those with an easy-to-use interface and similar features. It\u2019ll make it easier to get creative with software if you\u2019re already familiar with AE. If you're looking to create animations with the best 3D modeling software, a tool like Blender will better suit your projects.\n\nYou'll also want to make sure your computer is capable of running VFX software. These apps can be very resource intensive, so you may need to invest in the best video editing laptops and computers, or the best video editing Macs if you prefer Apple devices.\n\nPricing models vary between the best Adobe After Effects alternatives. Creative Cloud subscriptions can be a deal-breaker, so check how you\u2019ll pay. You\u2019ll find similar subscription models, one-off payments, and even free alternatives to After Effects. Select the product that best suits your creative budget.\n\nHow we tested the best alternatives to Adobe After Effects\n\nOur expert reviewers have tested, reviewed, and rated a range of creative software for when you want to avoid the Adobe ecosystem, including the best Photoshop alternatives, the best Lightroom alternatives, and the best Premiere Pro alternatives.\n\nAnd, of course, we have a long history of reviewing new editions of AE - for the latest version, check out our 2024 Adobe After Effects review.\n\nWhen determining the very best Adobe After Effects alternatives, we review each product based on interface, performance on devices, the size of the toolkit, and how users will actually use the VFX software.\n\nAfter Effects is famously easy and intuitive to use - like most Adobe programs, once you understand the basics, it\u2019s incredibly powerful. Alternatives to AE should feature experiences that are just as simple to use - even with a steep learning curve, we want to make sure users can navigate and create in a way that makes sense.\n\nWe also review how well the VFX software runs, and how rendering effects can impact computer performance.\n\nRecognizing that the best After Effects alternatives are often built for different skill-levels and purposes, we test the software based on its intended use and audience.\n\nPricing models are also a factor. A Creative Cloud subscription isn\u2019t for everyone - and where one-off purchases replace subscription models, we\u2019ll note this. When it comes to the best free Adobe After Effects alternatives, the software should be genuinely free, without hidden charges or hamstrung performance.\n\nToday's best Adobe After Effects deals\n\nAdobe After Effects is one of the best VFX tools out there. In our 5-star After Effects review, we praised the visual effects powerhouse for \"offering so much versatility and options, for the budding and professional video designer. It can be an overwhelming app, but there\u2019s really very little you can\u2019t do with it.\" See our guide How to try Adobe After Effects for free or with Creative Cloud\n\nYou've reached the end of the page.

            "content": "Here at Zacks, we offer our members many different opportunities to take full advantage of the stock market, as well as how to invest in ways that lead to long-term success.\n\nThe Zacks Premium service makes this easier. It features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank; full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List; Equity Research reports; and Premium stock screens like the Earnings ESP filter. All of these can help you quickly identify what stocks to buy, what to sell, and what are today's hottest industries.\n\nThe service also includes the Focus List, which is a long-term portfolio of top stocks that boast a winning, market-beating combination of growth and momentum qualities.\n\nBreaking Down the Zacks Focus List\n\nIf you could, wouldn't you jump at the chance for access to a curated list of stocks to kickstart your investing journey?\n\nThat's what the Zacks Focus List offers. It's a portfolio of 50 stocks that serve as a starting point for long-term investors to build their individual portfolios. The stocks included in the list are set to outperform the market over the next 12 months.\n\nOne thing that makes the Focus List even more advantageous is that each pick comes with a full Zacks Analyst Report. This helps explain why each stock was selected and why we believe it's a good pick for the long-term.\n\nThe portfolio's past performance only solidifies why investors should consider it as a starting point. For 2020, the Focus List gained 13.85% on an annualized basis compared to the S&P 500's return of 9.38%. Cumulatively, the portfolio has returned 2,519.23% while the S&P returned 854.95%. Returns are for the period of February 1, 1996 to March 31, 2021.\n\nFocus List Methodology\n\nWhen stocks are picked for the Focus List, it reflects our enduring reliance on the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nEarnings estimates, or expectations of growth and profitability, come from brokerage analysts who track publicly traded companies; these analysts work together with company management to analyze every aspect that may affect future earnings, like interest rates, the economy, and sector and industry optimism.\n\nWhat a company will earn down the road also needs to be taken into consideration, and this is why earnings estimate revisions are so important.\n\nWhen a stock receives upward earnings estimate revisions, it will likely get even more positive changes in the future. For instance, if an analyst raised their earnings outlook last month, they'll probably do so again this month, and other analysts will follow.\n\nHarnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions is where the Zacks Rank comes in. The Zacks Rank is a unique, proprietary stock-rating model that utilizes changes to a company's quarterly earnings expectations to help investors build a winning portfolio.\n\nThere are four main factors behind the Zacks Rank: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside, and Surprise. Each one of these features is then given a raw score that's recalculated every night and compiled into the Rank. Using this data, stocks are classified into five groups, ranging from \"Strong Buy\" to \"Strong Sell.\"\n\nThe Focus List is comprised of stocks hand-picked from a long list of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) ranked companies, meaning that each new addition boasts a bullish earnings consensus among analysts.\n\nIt can be very profitable to buy stocks with rising earnings estimates, as stock prices respond to revisions. By adding Focus List stocks, there's a great chance you'll be getting into companies whose future earnings estimates will be raised, which can lead to price momentum.\n\nFocus List Spotlight: Adobe Systems (ADBE)\n\nJose California-based Adobe Inc. is one of the largest software companies in the world. Adobe picks up licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, ADBE was added to the Focus List at $285 per share. Shares have increased 55.9% to $444.32 since then, and the company is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.\n\nOne analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $20.39. ADBE boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.6%.\n\nEarnings for ADBE are forecasted to see growth of 10.7% for the current fiscal year as well.\n\nReveal Winning Stocks\n\nUnlock all of our powerful research, tools and analysis, including the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research Reports, Zacks Earnings ESP Filter, Premium Screener and more, as part of Zacks Premium.

ADBE\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 35.95 and 21.79 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdobe\n\nAdobe Systems (ADBE) has been a powerhouse in software, delivering a remarkable 238,000% total return since its IPO. Its transition to the cloud has driven consistent revenue growth, supported by strong cash flow conversion and steady share repurchases. Currently trading at an EV/EBIT of 25, Adobe presents an intriguing opportunity despite concerns that AI could disrupt its business. While the stock has declined due to fears of AI-driven competition, Adobe\u2019s entrenched position and high switching costs make a mass exodus of customers unlikely. The company is well-positioned to navigate AI advancements, potentially leveraging them to enhance its offerings rather than be displaced by them. With revenue expected to grow at 8%-10% annually and continued buybacks supporting long-term returns, Adobe remains a compelling investment. While the stock could experience further volatility, its historical strength and resilient business model suggest significant upside for long-term investors.\n\nAdobe Inc. (ADBE) is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 117 hedge fund portfolios held ADBE at the end of the third quarter which was 123 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "COMMENTARY: Firewalls and antivirus software alone are inadequate for defending hospitals against data breaches and ransomware attacks. Both the digital and physical environments must be protected. Managed security service providers (MSSPs) recommend physical security tools ranging from surveillance cameras and biometric access controls to patient visitor management and real-time location systems (RTLS) that work together to safeguard people and sensitive data and spaces.\n\nBarriers to Adoption\n\nThis type of multi-layered security framework combines visual identification with physical access control and digital credentials to make the hospital\u2019s overall security framework significantly more resilient. Achieving this resilience across both the digital and physical domains is critical, given the many entry points that must be managed in an increasingly threatening hospital environment.\n\nNo hospital wants to risk having unauthorized personnel in its labs, imaging rooms, emergency facilities, or anywhere where staff and administrators do their work. Most hospital IT teams and administrators generally know that they are only one attack away from a physical security breach with the potential for financial and reputational damage, injuries, or worse.\n\nNevertheless, nearly one-third of respondents to HID\u2019s October 2024 \u201cSecuring the Future of Healthcare\u201d survey said they were neutral to extremely dissatisfied with their hospital\u2019s current security measures. Another 45% reported they were only somewhat satisfied. The most significant barriers to doing something about it and upgrading their physical security? Cost was cited by 74% of survey respondents. Other reasons include lack of executive support (31%) and belief that physical security is not a high priority (24%).\n\nThere are, however, many early adopters who are deploying the kinds of solutions that help mitigate threats before they intensify.\n\nFor instance, physical ID badges and lanyards, along with other traditional access control methods, still play key roles in hospital security strategies. They are used to visually identify visitors while also preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing sensitive areas or data. These physical security approaches are increasingly being augmented or even replaced by mobile and biometric authentication credentials. The HID survey found that more than a third of healthcare facilities, especially in large urban areas, now use biometric authentication, and 11% have adopted facial recognition technologies.\n\nAnother development is the integration of facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven surveillance. Healthcare facilities that add these layers are using them to track and manage those entering and making their way through various areas of the healthcare facility. These systems can be used to flag unauthorized people, track unusual movements and behavior, and help security teams respond immediately to potential breaches.\n\nMany facilities are also adopting automated, rather than manual, security. In our survey, 56% of respondents said their automated alert systems provide real-time alerts about potential threats and can trigger responsive actions before the situation escalates.\n\nDefining Success\n\nThese automated alerting systems are often augmented with duress badges that enable hospital employees to discreetly signal distress by pressing a button on their ID badge. They are similar to panic buttons but offer the advantages of being inconspicuous and, when integrated with real-time location systems (RTLS), capable of triggering a more proactive security response with pinpoint accuracy. Fifty-three percent of HID\u2019s hospital security survey respondents foresee moving to these types of automated security responses and 33% are now planning adoption.\n\nAs the healthcare industry moves from physical to digital identity management solutions, they are also taking a more integrated, multi-layered approach, blending physical and cybersecurity measures. They are balancing digital solutions with ID badges and other traditional visual identification methods that are still vitally important in many parts of the healthcare facility.\n\nA successful transition to this multi-layered, future-proofed security framework will enhance patient care and improve the hospital experience. It will make employees safer, enable the hospital to better manage visitors, streamline workflows, and enable healthcare facilities to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas by detecting and responding to potential threats in real-time.\n\nAlmost 70% of HID\u2019s survey respondents foresee a future where cyber and physical security challenges are addressed simultaneously to mitigate potential risks in both environments. With this approach and ongoing investments in further improving this resilient, multi-layered security foundation, healthcare administrators can better protect valuable data and other assets while forging a safer future for patients, staff, and visitors.",

            "content": "As a professional photographer who uses some of the best cameras, I never thought I'd ever say something like this \u2013 smartphones are amazing tools for photography. There plenty of apps that can help you to plan shoots, find locations and share your work, and most of all you have a high-quality camera in your pocket, with you at all times. We've even curated a best cameraphone guide to help you pick the right one.\n\nIf you're a serious photographer like me yet often find yourself out and about without your mirrorless camera, it's your trusty smartphone that has to pick up the slack. I still believe my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra isn\u2019t anywhere near as good as my professional camera kit, but by shooting in raw image format \u2013 yes, most flagship smartphones can capture in raw \u2013 and processing photos in Adobe Lightroom Mobile, it's possible to achieve professional image quality, like I was able to recently (see below).\n\nI took this photo of a pier in the UK with my Samsung Galaxy 23 Ultra smartphone, and edited it for the final image using Adobe Lightroom Mobile. (Image credit: James Abbott)\n\nRaw format enables you to make changes to color and exposure in a way that you can't with the default JPEG / HEIF format, especially with a powerful mobile editor such as Adobe Lightroom Mobile. Many smartphone can capture in raw format, usually in a Pro mode.\n\nAs a Samsung Galaxy 23 Ultra owner, I can also capture in this format using the Expert Raw app, which has to be downloaded from the Galaxy Store. Expert Raw provides manual, semi-automatic and automatic control of the camera settings depending on preference. I usually shoot in manual, but sometimes use Auto ISO and Auto White Balance in low light conditions with mixed light sources.\n\nExpert Raw can capture 12MP and 50MP 16-bit raw files in DNG format, but the caveat here is that at 12MP you can shoot in UW (ultra-wide), W (wide), T (telephoto) and ST (super telephoto) while 50MP is only available in W (wide). 12MP provides a print size of just over A4 and plenty of resolution for online use, plus it also allows you to shoot in the phone's astrophotography and multiple exposure modes.\n\nShooting in your phone's camera app Pro mode\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\nWhat you need \u2013 A smartphone with a Pro mode and raw capture\n\n\u2013 An app that can process raw files, such as Adobe Lightroom\n\n\u2013 Potentially a support to steady your phone\n\n\u2013 Some edits require Adobe's paid subscription Photography plan\n\nShooting in Expert Raw is no different than shooting with the Galaxy Ultra's standard camera app in Pro mode. Most smartphones will have an equivalent Pro mode. You can leave all of the camera settings in auto, a mixture of auto and manual or set everything to manual. Since the aperture in smartphone cameras is fixed, you won\u2019t have to worry about this. Most apps also allow you to view a live histogram to aid exposure if you find this useful.\n\nAll you need is your smartphone with raw capture and for this example, Adobe Lightroom Mobile (there are powerful alternatives too). If you'd like to shoot long exposures which can improve low light image quality and get creative effects, you'll need to fix your phone to a support, such as a tripod. For most people, shooting handheld is the way to go because by the time you're adding additional kit like a tripod, you may as well be carrying a full camera kit. However, if you only shoot with a phone, a phone tripod mount and an ultra-lightweight travel tripod could be a worthwhile investment.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

The same settings were copied from my phone to the tablet to ensure the results are identical.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n1. Removing perspective distortion\n\nSome shots will need to be cropped slightly while others, like this one, will require perspective correction. This is achieved simply by clicking on the highlighted button to correct vertical and/or horizontal distortion.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n2. Applying Lens Corrections\n\nLightroom Mobile includes lens profiles for some phones, so head to Optics within the Adjustments tab and click on Enable Lens Corrections. This can be adjusted further using the Distortion Control slider if necessary; a grid appears to assist.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n3. Correcting White Balance\n\nClick on the Color option within the Adjustments tab and you can either use the White Balance profiles or adjust The Temp and Tint sliders manually. For this shot, setting the Temp to 4300 and Tint to 0 produced the best result.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n4. Adjusting the tones\n\nClick on the Light option in the Adjustments tab and make any adjustments as required to Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Whites and Blacks. The Tone Curve is best for adding contrast but this is a high contrast scene so the Contrast slider was simply set to 10 to avoid losing detail, especially the highlights.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n5. Applying noise reduction\n\nThis shot was taken at ISO 3200, so there's some luminosity noise present. To deal with this grainy type of noise, click on the Noise option within Detail and increase the Noise Reduction slider. Color noise is dealt with by a default automatic setting.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\nTo use the Masks, you'll need an Adobe Photography Plan subscription and be signed in. Once subscribed, click on the Mask icon and then the Create new Mask icon to select a Mask type. Here, a Linear Gradient was applied to the sky, then Light was selected to reduce Exposure.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n7. Trying Color Grading\n\nColor Grading is a great way to add creative color effects to photos and the controls can be found within Color. For this shot, Blue was applied to just the Highlights, more for a subtle and targeted color correction than a creative effect.\n\n(Image credit: James Abbott)\n\n8. Tweaking HSL\n\nThe Hue, Saturation and Luminosity, also found within Color, are a great way to control the way different color channels appear. For this shot, the Blue Channel was made more purple to match the sky at the time of shooting.\n\nAnd there you have it, those were all of the Lightroom Mobile editing steps I took from the original unedited raw file from my Galaxy 23 Ultra, to the end result that you see.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions about shooting and editing photos on your phone in the comments below.",

            "content": "Advertising technology has entered a new phase that pairs personal privacy with targeting.\n\nFor years, the ad industry has depended on third-party tracking cookies \u2014 tiny snippets of code downloaded to a user\u2019s browser \u2014 to identify prospects, gather data about them, and employ that data for targeting. Consumers saw relevant ads, and advertisers enjoyed good, if not superb, returns.\n\nCookies\n\nUnfortunately, cookie-based tracking has privacy problems. In contrast to first-party cookies, which store preferences, third-party tracking cookies aggregate, share, and thereby expose lots of private information.\n\nJust this month, Wired magazine reported, \u201cGoogle\u2019s advertising ecosystem reveals that a wealth of sensitive information is being openly served up to some of the world\u2019s largest brands\u2026Experts say that when combined with other data, this information could be used to identify and target specific individuals.\u201d\n\nPrivacy advocates recognized this and began railing against sharing personal and sensitive information across advertising networks. Technology companies responded. Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser, for example, stopped allowing tracking cookies back in 2019.\n\nGoogle, which operates one of the largest ad networks in the world and has the most popular web browser in Chrome, nearly killed third-party cookies in 2024, as it planned to block them in Chrome and move all advertisers to alternative targeting methods \u2014 but it didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cGoogle heard the alarm bells from the industry that nearly 20 years of ad tech infrastructure cannot be recreated in six months,\u201d said David Stein, then the CEO of the data firm Audigent, in an April 2024 email to Practical Ecommerce.\n\nThose alarm bells could have been Google\u2019s ad exchange customers, its ad tech partners, and the anti-trust regulators concerned that ending cookie tracking would give Google a performance advertising monopoly.\n\nHence tracking cookies remained in Chrome, but ad tech providers did not stop innovating.\n\nInnovation\n\nThe same day that Wired published its report, Adobe announced the general availability of its real-time customer data platform (CDP).\n\n\u201cBrands have long relied on third-party audience signals to power tailored digital ads. As consumers play a more active role in customizing their privacy preferences, a move away from third-party data means new tools are required for brands to identify relevant audiences and deliver personalized ad experiences,\u201d read the Adobe press release.\n\nAdobe\u2019s CDP allows advertisers and publishers to securely collaborate on first-party data to enhance ad targeting while respecting user privacy. This relationship is often called second-party data sharing, and resembles Shopify\u2019s Audiences and similar products.\n\nMethods\n\nSecond-party data sharing is one of six primary methods ad tech companies are exploring as they try to maintain or improve ad targeting efficacy without raising privacy concerns.\n\nSecond-party data sharing allows advertisers and publishers to collaborate, often sharing aggregate data.\n\nFirst-party data is when a business uses its own data to target or retarget individuals or cohorts. Many companies are buying publications to advertise to known customers and prospects.\n\nUnified ID solutions produce encrypted identifiers to share among systems. The Trade Desk\u2019s Unified Solution is an example. Often, these IDs stem from an email address.\n\nData clean rooms make it possible for analysts to use data without privacy concerns.\n\nCohort-based advertising targets groups of shoppers with similar profiles instead of individuals.\n\nContextual targeting analyzes the context \u2014 web page, app, video, email \u2014 to deliver relevant ads to consumers without relying on personal data. Artificial intelligence makes this more successful.\n\nUsed individually or in combination, these targeting techniques have significant promise. Most reports suggest that results vary among advertisers, yet the techniques will likely work better than third-party cookies.\n\nAd Experiments\n\nListing the ad tech companies developing cookie-less targeting methods would fill pages. Thus advertisers seeking to acquire customers might find it wise to experiment.\n\nFor example, marketing platform Zeta Global recently purchased the email advertising company LiveIntent. Some in the industry believe Zeta Global valued LiveIntent\u2019s ability to identify website visitors based on email interactions.\n\nCould Zeta Global\u2019s demand-side platform be worth a look?\n\nSimilarly, Paved, another email ad platform, expanded its programmatic network, permitting advertisers to target and retarget shoppers safely and privately.\n\nIn short, ad targeting is changing, and the best options may not be familiar platforms.",

The truth is that we now have many applications and programs capable of doing this. However, few have the power and versatility of Adobe Lightroom.\n\nIt is likely that when talking about Adobe, the first thing that comes to mind is Adobe Photoshop. While Photoshop is one of the best editing programs available today, it can sometimes be too complex. With Lightroom, we can edit our photographs simply and effectively, as you will see below.\n\nAdobe Photoshop Lightroom DOWNLOAD\n\nWhat is Generative Remove, and how can I use it?\n\nThanks to Adobe Firefly\u2019s generative artificial intelligence, the Generative Remove feature in Lightroom allows us to remove any unwanted element from an image. Lightroom will leave no trace, no matter how complex your image is or how many objects you want to erase.\n\nIf you already have Lightroom installed and your photograph ready, it\u2019s time to get started:\n\nWith Lightroom open, import the photograph you want to edit. Drag it directly into the program and select the Add 1 photo. button.\n\nbutton. Double-click on the image to open it.\n\nGo to the right panel and click on Remove the eraser icon. Make sure the Use generative AI checkbox is checked.\n\nAdjust the brush to cover the area you want to remove.\n\nWhen you have finished selecting the area, click on Remove and wait for the AI to process the image. In a matter of seconds, you will see the result.\n\nWhen finished, Lightroom will offer you other finishes that you can view by sliding over Variations . Check the results and keep the one you like the most.\n\n. Check the results and keep the one you like the most. If you want to cancel the process, simply select the trash can symbol.\n\nWhen selecting with the brush, you will see two options, Add and Substract. The first will help you expand your initial selection. The second will do just the opposite, removing parts of the selection. Combine them to properly adjust the elements you want to erase.\n\nUnder the Use generative AI checkbox, you will see another one called Detect objects. If you check it, Lightroom will automatically detect the objects to be removed within a large selection. To use it, activate Detect objects and draw over what you want to remove. Lightroom will autonomously apply a mask over the object.\n\nWhere is Generative Remove available?\n\nYou will find the Generative Remove feature within the Lightroom applications for desktop (Windows and MacOS), mobile (Android and iOS), Lightroom Class, and Adobe Camera Raw.\n\nYou must keep in mind that, to use this type of deletion, you have to stay connected to the Internet at all times. This is a function that works thanks to the cloud, so its effectiveness will also depend on the speed of your connection.\n\nGenerative Remove on mobile: How does it work?\n\nAs we mentioned before, the mobile and tablet versions of Adobe Lightroom also include Generative Remove. Here\u2019s how you can use it on iOS and Android:\n\nWith the app open, choose the photo you want to retouch.\n\nClick on Remove . You will see it with an eraser in the toolbar below the image.\n\n. You will see it below the image. Keep the Generative AI option enabled.\n\noption enabled. Set the brush size and paint over the object you want to erase.\n\nWait for the app to process the image; you will see the result in a short time. If you like it, select the icon.\n\nWith the Refine option, you can further perfect the deletion if needed. Just like in the desktop version, Lightroom will show you three variations with different finishes. You have more options like Opacity, which allows you to control the opacity of the adjustment within that area. Finally, with Restore, you can return to the original image without edits.\n\nIf you click on the three dots symbol located at the top right, you can save the image to your device or even copy the settings to apply them to other images.\n\nOther additional features of Adobe Lightroom\n\nIn addition to Generative Remove, the integration of generative AI within Lightroom has provided us with new and better tools to correct our images. Some of them are:\n\nHeal: Improves an area considering the colors and the tone that surrounds it.\n\nImproves an area considering the colors and the tone that surrounds it. Clone: replicates the pixels from the source in an area.\n\nTo use Heal, do the following:\n\nClick on the Remove icon (the eraser).\n\nicon (the eraser).

Lightroom will take a sample of the nearby pixels to perform this action.\n\nWith the mouse, move the area from which Lightroom takes the sample to adjust the result.\n\nIn the case of Clone, follow these steps:\n\nFrom Remove , select the Clone icon.\n\n, select the icon. Hover the brush over the area you want to edit. The program will copy precisely the pixels from the source area, which you can move at will.\n\nAdjust it to achieve the finish you desire.",

In their credit, they intend to cover the largest possible number of users: from the most experts to the initiates. So, from Softzone, we will see a comparison where we highlight the pros and cons of one of the options we have mentioned.\n\nPixelmator Pro\n\nWe may be facing the most accessible option of the three. This program tries to prioritize simplicity and tries not to sacrifice its functionality.\n\nIf we look at their strengths, we will find, as we have mentioned, an intuitive interface more adapted to new users. Compared to its opponents, the learning curve is lower.\n\nIts integration with the Macos operating system expands its compatibility between platforms and takes better technologies such as \u201cCore Mi\u201d, based on artificial intelligence.\n\nIts price is affordable compared to its opponents. Its model is of unique payment, without monthly subscriptions.\n\nOn the other hand, its exclusivity with macOS, which was one of its strengths, also makes the wind blow in the opposite direction. Windows and Linux users will simply not be able to access this software. Another limitations to highlight by professionals is that their functions can fall short for more technical and demanding projects.\n\nAffinity Photo\n\nA solid and serious alternative to Photoshop.\n\nIn his belt we find a professional level tool, with functions that directly rivize the adobe editor, such as the HDR or support edition for PSD himself.\n\nIt has support with all operating systems: Windows, Linux and Macos, so it makes it the first alternative in this field. And as for the price, it is not the cheapest of the three, but continues to have a single payment model, which becomes a cheaper alternative than the adobe editor. He also enjoys free update releases by his developers.\n\nHowever, its learning curve is somewhat more complex than that of Pixelmator Pro and lacks certain collaboration options that Photoshop does.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: The industry leader\n\nEven if you have never used an image editor, you know Photoshop. It is the most widespread tool of image editing in the digital environment, and so it has been being more than a decade.\n\nAmong its virtues we find their advanced abilities. It is able to carry out basic editions and projects that require a great technical effort. On the other hand, being part of the adobe ecosystem, it is perfectly compatible with other programs such as Illustrator or Premiere (video editing). His constant updates always keep him at the avant -garde, and his compatibility with almost all commercial image formats offers a very broad support of compatibility.\n\nThe cons, as you can see, are their high cost, which you can pay monthly or annually, their need for technical competences by the user for proper operation and also of a more powerful hardware.\n\nTherefore, what should you opt for?\n\nFrom our point of view, Pixelmator is the most affordable and simple tool as long as you have macOS. Affinity Pro could be the best option for advanced users with more limited monetary resources, and Photoshop remains the ideal for the most complex projects.",

            "content": "In the blur that is our current business landscape, it\u2019s easy to become consumed by the minutiae of day-to-day operations\u2014chasing quarterly results, preparing for the next meeting, or refining board presentations. While these daily tasks are undeniably important, organizations must occasionally step back to ground their actions in a broader strategic perspective.\n\nNavigating today\u2019s evolving environment requires addressing four pivotal shifts: digital transformation, sustainability, deglobalization, and fostering resilience. By recognizing the implications of these trends, organizations can better prepare for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nThe Digital Transformation and Transition to AI\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics is reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace. Organizations are digitizing processes, services, and operations to drive growth, deliver better value to customers, and uncover new opportunities. This wave of transformation is not just about adopting technology\u2014it\u2019s about harnessing it to empower the workforce, increase transparency, and reduce operating costs.\n\nAI-driven automation accelerates decision-making, streamlines workflows, and frees employees to focus on high-value tasks. Companies leveraging these tools are not only gaining competitive advantages but are also creating a more agile and efficient operational framework. As AI becomes more sophisticated and accessible, its role in driving business success will only continue to grow.\n\nA Focus on Sustainability\n\nStrategic long-view planning demands attention to sustainability\u2014an area that touches social, economic, and environmental considerations. Companies are increasingly embedding sustainability into their strategic and operational decisions to create long-term stakeholder value. For example, the transition to cleaner energy sources is gaining momentum, with nearly one in five cars sold in 2023 being electric vehicles\u2014a sign of a broader consumer shift. Additionally, more than half of FTSE100 companies, including all oil and gas members, now have board-level ESG (environmental, social, and governance) committees.\n\nThis emphasis on sustainability reflects a broader societal expectation that organizations address climate change and other global challenges. Businesses that fail to adapt risk becoming outdated or, worse, problematic. By aligning with sustainable practices, companies can secure their relevance and foster trust among stakeholders.\n\nDeglobalization of the Supply Chain\n\nAnother pressing challenge is the deglobalization of supply chains. As organizations seek to balance globalization and localization, diversification has become crucial for maintaining resiliency and efficiency.\n\nA recent study of 17,000 American-imported commodities revealed that China holds a market share of 50% or more in over 20 industries, including chips, communication equipment, and optical instruments. Furthermore, China accounts for 80% of the production of raw materials for solar cells and their modular assemblies.\n\nThis heavy reliance on a single region poses significant risks. Any disruption in localized supply chains can lead to widespread instability. To counter this, organizations must prioritize diversification and build more resilient supply chain models, focusing on planning, procurement, and execution to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure continuity.\n\nA Change in Attitude\n\nShifts in digital transformation, sustainability, and supply chain dynamics are reshaping not only businesses but also societal expectations and individual mindsets. In this environment, resilience\u2014both personal and organizational\u2014has emerged as a critical factor for success.\n\nResilient workers are better equipped to navigate challenges, maintain productivity, and adapt to change. According to a study from the National Library of Medicine, employees with high resilience demonstrate lower absenteeism and higher productivity, leveraging \u201cpositive mental skills to remain psychologically steady and focused when faced with challenges or adversity.\u201d Organizations, too, must cultivate resilience to thrive amid constant change. A resilient organization is better positioned to anticipate disruptions, pivot strategies, and sustain long-term growth.\n\nA Plan for a Resilient Future\n\nAddressing any one of these four shifts\u2014digital transformation, sustainability, deglobalization, and resilience\u2014represents a significant undertaking. Tackling all four simultaneously can feel like a precarious game of Jenga, where ignoring one block can destabilize the entire structure.\n\nThe solution lies in adopting a holistic approach to strategic long-view planning. By revisiting supply chains with a focus on sustainability and resilience, organizations can build a stable foundation for the future. This involves making thoughtful changes in planning, procurement, and execution to align with evolving demands.\n\nStrategic planning is not about focusing on a single issue\u2014it\u2019s about managing an interconnected web of factors that influence an organization\u2019s trajectory. While this may seem daunting, achieving balance across these areas creates a stronger, more adaptable organization prepared for whatever challenges the future may bring.\n\nBy embracing digital transformation, prioritizing sustainability, diversifying supply chains, and fostering resilience, businesses can position themselves for long-term success. The key lies in acknowledging the complexity of these shifts and navigating them with agility and foresight. The ability to adapt and thrive is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s essential. By taking the strategic long view, organizations can move beyond the daily grind and achieve a future marked by innovation, stability, and growth.",

Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, and Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, House Bill 50 would create the Delaware Energy Fund, administered by Sustainable Energy Utility, to provide financial assistance to moderate-income Delawareans. The bill would also allocate additional funding to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve received an overwhelming number of calls and emails from constituents who were blindsided by the dramatic increase in their energy bills \u2013 many are paying two, three, even four times what they normally do. That kind of unexpected expense is hard for anyone, but for families struggling to make ends meet, it can mean serious hardship,\u201d said Heffernan. \"These programs will provide immediate relief to those who need it most, and as an added bonus, they do so without adding any extra cost to the state.\"\n\nUnder HB 50, a portion of funds currently allocated to various green energy programs would be redirected to the Delaware Energy Fund and LIHEAP, providing direct energy bill assistance to eligible residents.\n\nThe new Delaware Energy Fund would be paid for by CO2 allowance proceeds, which Delaware receives as a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state program designed to cap and reduce carbon emissions from the power sector. Revenue from RGGI is typically reinvested in energy efficiency, renewable energy and other consumer benefit programs.\n\nThe Delaware Energy Fund program would be available to households earning less than 350% of the federal poverty level, which for a four-person household would be an annual income of less than $112,525.\n\nAdditional funding for the LIHEAP program would come from alternative compliance payments, fees paid by electric suppliers and companies that do not meet required renewable energy targets.\n\nLIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income Delawareans cover the cost of energy-related expenses. Income eligibility for LIHEAP is defined as 60% of state median income, which for a four-person household would be an annual income of less than $72,577.\n\n\u201cUtility rates for Delmarva Power customers rose too high too fast, leaving many Delaware families in dire need of relief,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cThis bill represents a critical first step in a broader approach to support and protect consumers against rising prices, with further actions from Democratic lawmakers set to follow in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nDelaware Energy Fund recipients would be required to participate in energy savings and efficiency programs.\n\nThe legislation would sunset three years after enactment. HB 50 has been assigned to the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee.",

Shimizu Shota was among the long list of speakers and, according to the Japanese website Digital Camera Watch, spoke on the advantages and disadvantages of using generative AI for video.\n\nWhat struck me among Shota\u2019s translated statements were his comments on the misconception that AI makes it easy to create. During the presentation, he walked through what was actually needed to create some of the AI videos produced by DO/AI, an AI-focused agency where Shota works as the creative director.\n\nWhile some AI platforms advertise generating video in just a few seconds, getting to the final result in fact takes days. In the first video Shota presented, he said it took two days and more than a dozen different AI platforms to produce, from ChatGPT for the prompts to Adobe Firefly and Midjourney for images.\n\nBut the second example the creative director shared offers even more insight. The AI short called Sin-chan and Dad is about a minute and a half long. Just one scene in the short required generating more than 600 images, while another required 800 still images. Shota explained that the AI created unexpected results, including changing the character\u2019s clothing mid-shot, so the clip had to be generated as a series of still images instead.\n\n\u306a\u304b\u3058\u307e\u3057\u3093\u3084\u76e3\u7763 AI\u52d5\u753b\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u300e\u3057\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u304a\u7236\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300f - YouTube Watch On\n\nABOVE: Watch the AI-intensive Shin-chan and Dad\n\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter The best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!

For example, asking a generative video platform to create a video of a gymnast usually produces rather horrifying results with a clear misunderstanding of complex human movement.\n\nShota also noted that AI generators can be inconsistent, such as details changing mid-scene. He also noted AI \"hallucinations,\" or generations of things that are physically impossible.\n\nGenerative AI video is in its infancy, however, and Adobe\u2019s newly announced Firefly Video model is still in public beta testing. AI's weaknesses aren't necessarily a bad thing \u2013 some of the weaknesses of artificial intelligence can be used to spot whether or not an image is real or is made by AI.\n\nYou may also like\u2026\n\nRead more on the best video editing software and the best Photoshop alternatives.",

I tried alternative free video editors, then examined Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Kdenlive. I settled on the latter for basic video editing with text overlays and a few effects. Read on to learn more on why I made this choice.\n\n1. Kdenlive Is Free\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro costs $22.99 per month. Paying for the monthly subscription just to keep the program alive on my PC is a dead weight in my pocket. I agree that the features that Premiere Pro brings are unmatchable. But for the kind of video editing I do, Kdenlive works fine.\n\nI do not have to pay a penny to install and use Kdenlive. Like Premiere Pro, Kdenlive is regularly updated to fix things and add new features to improve efficiency. As I get all I need to edit a video from a free program, it is not worth paying for an expensive monthly subscription.\n\n2. Kdenlive Is Not Resource Hungry\n\nMy laptop is not designed for professional video editing. It has modest features that enable me to do my tasks seamlessly. When I edit videos on Adobe Premiere Pro, my laptop becomes painfully slow. I cannot browse the Internet or use another program properly. I have to wait until I complete the video editing or just drop it midway to use another program.\n\nPremiere Pro makes my PC struggle to make all opened programs work fine. Premiere Pro comes with many processes like Creative Cloud Libraries that consume a major chunk of memory collectively.\n\nKdenlive, on the other hand, does not stress system resources. It coexists with other programs. While editing on Kdenlive, I can listen to songs on YouTube, which I have opened in a browser, and open another program in the background. It makes no difference, as Kdenlive behaves as just another program on my laptop.\n\nAnd finally, when I complete my editing and export videos, I have to disable the Internet and end all the unnecessary programs to make room for Premiere Pro. It uses a majority of the resources and exports at a snail\u2019s pace.\n\nI know the export time depends on the effects used in the video, video quality, length, etc., but Kdenlive exports in less time comparatively with less resources. Meanwhile, I can use other programs and do some work instead of waiting for the export to complete.\n\n3. Kdenlive Is Easy to Adapt\n\nKdenlive has a simple and intuitive interface with everything you need to edit a video. It is easy to find options to edit video, color correct, add effects, and edit audio. Everything is available on the screen instead of navigating in the menu and finding the options. A person without any editing knowledge can understand how to use it.\n\nPremiere Pro also has a simple interface, but the jargon puts me off. Perhaps it is not an issue for a professional editor. At first, I even found it hard to find options to add text to my video in Premiere Pro, which is not the case with Kdenlive.\n\nTip: use Kdenlive with these keyboard shortcuts for an efficient experience.\n\n4. Kdenlive Is Community Driven\n\nMost of the features on Kdenlive are contributed by the community. It has a great open-source community that just wants to make Kdenlive better and help its users. The community helped Kdenlive users like me get advanced motion-tracking capabilities. It has seven tracker algorithms to help various tracking uses so that I get the best tracking of a motion in the video.\n\nTo get similar advanced tracking tools on Premiere Pro, I have to use plugins from third-party sources. I have to shell out extra money to buy the plugins and install them on my PC, which stresses the resources even more.\n\nIf I need extra features that are not available on Kdenlive, I can visit the KDE Store, find add-ons, and download to use them for free.\n\n5. Rendering a Video Is Easy on Kdenlive\n\nAfter successfully editing my video on Kdenlive, I can easily render the video with easy-to-understand formats. I will have a clear idea of the output with the options I select while exporting. Its no nonsense way of integrating different rendering options makes the whole exporting process a no-brainer.\n\nPremiere Pro, on the other hand, gives options for presets and formats that I cannot comprehend. I feel like I should seek professional help to export my video in better quality. If I select a preset and a format, I have to wait for the render to complete to see how it looks.\n\nOnce I tried Kdenlive, I fell in love with the free feature-rich program that\u2019s available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. From basic editing to creating content for social media platforms by adding your watermark on the video, Kdenlive enables you to do everything. I am also thankful that the Kdenlive community makes it better with each passing day. For me, the Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Kdenlive debate leaves just one clear winner: Kdenlive.\n\nImage credit: Unsplash. All screenshots by Guru Prasad.",

            "content": "Adobe (ADBE) investors must be feeling motion sickness. In early 2023, the stock was the darling of Wall Street as upbeat earnings beats helped the stock from lows below $300 to as high as $600 in January 2024. The past year has been the exact opposite as the stock has trended lower, losing 16% as tougher competition in the creative software market and a delay in AI monetization have taken their toll. However, while I acknowledge the potential of AI to disrupt creative software, I believe the risks to Adobe are far overblown by market bears.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nThe creative software kingpin continues posting resilient results while reveling in some of the strongest brand loyalty in tech market history. This helps to support the user base numbers and, ultimately, ADBE\u2019s bottom line. The Street needs some patience to tease out value from the stock and for the overarching AI story to unfold.\n\nI remain an ADBE bull as the digital and media solutions giant prepares to launch a slew of innovative products while AI monetization awaits. Given the relatively lower entry price, building a long-term position becomes alluring as the stock sinks lower. While ADBE may not monetize AI sooner than expected, investors must take a long-term view to capitalize on ADBE stock.\n\nAdobe is Still the Kingpin in Creative Software\n\nAdobe is known for its flagship Creative Suite products, which millions of professionals use daily. However, alternatives such as Canva and Davinci Resolve seek to poach Adobe\u2019s market share. Nevertheless, Adobe is still considered the industry standard for creative software simply because of its rich suite of products and the Adobe ecosystem. According to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence and IDC, Adobe dominates the $15 billion creative software market with a 71% market share.\n\nThe company\u2019s market dominance allows it to charge premium prices and generate higher margins. Brand loyalty also ensures the company can charge more while maintaining the same user base. ADBE\u2019s trailing twelve-month gross margin is 89%, which is extremely impressive considering that the average profit margin among top U.S. companies is in the low teens.\n\nADBE is Unloved, But Can it Become a Darling Again?\n\nAdobe faces increased competition from Canva, OpenAI, MidJourney, and newer unicorns foraying into the world of AI-powered design tools. It is also struggling to monetize its offerings because it is focused on an adopt-first, monetize-later strategy, and the Street isn\u2019t a fan of it.\n\nTo make matters worse, Adobe undercooked its FY2025 revenue forecasts, stating that it expects to deliver around $23 billion in sales. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected revenues to be a touch higher at $23.77 billion. The stock fell dramatically after earnings and has been down 17% since. Was that warranted?\n\nProbably not. The ~$300 million under projection relates to a new pricing strategy and foreign exchange headwinds. Despite the undershoot, it\u2019s not a reason to dump ADBE stock.\n\nI believe Adobe is playing the long game, and the bears are overestimating the threat AI poses. I acknowledge that consumers will be enthralled with adopting AI. However, it\u2019s not so simple for enterprises, especially the larger variety. This is directly reflected in Adobe\u2019s revenue, which is 80% recurring as of the most recent year. Adobe\u2019s Digital Media annual recurring revenue in 2024 was $17.33 billion\u2013something ADBE bears tend to overlook. When I look at Adobe, I do not see a fundamentally troubled enterprise. I see a strong brand with a solid ecosystem that\u2019s maintained its leadership position in the industry for decades.\n\nWhile I am bullish on Adobe, I am also a pragmatist and do not have unrealistic expectations about future AI-generated revenue as quickly as some investors do. Adobe knows it has to work extremely hard to stay competitive. So far in 2025, Adobe has launched beta versions of the new Firefly image generation and video generation tools to compete with market peers. Shortly after its video model was made public, as a direct competitor to OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated his $660 price target on ADBE shares. Weiss is optimistic about adopting and monetizing the new Firefly Video model and likes the company\u2019s move towards tiered pricing, offering both a Standard and a Pro version. Similarly, I also view the tiered plans as a benefit for Adobe because they offer something for every budget, and that\u2019s the recipe for increasing adoption.\n\nIs ADBE Stock Undervalued?\n\nDespite a monumental sell-off during 2024, ADBE stock is up 2.2% year-to-date, and its shares are priced at 22.4x forward earnings, which is reasonably cheap, in my opinion. That\u2019s actually a 35% discount to its 5-year average P/E of 34x, and we didn\u2019t even have any AI potential back then. Adobe is growing both sales and profits at ~10% per year, and I believe it is fairly valued at its current multiple. For patient and long-term investors, this presents an attractive entry point.\n\nIs Adobe a Good Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nOn Wall Street, ADBE stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buy, eight Hold, and one Sell ratings over the past three months. ADBE\u2019s average price target of $572.26 per share implies almost 26% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nResilient Loyalty Makes ADBE a Smart Long-Term Play\n\nAdobe is an established company that has maintained its leadership position in the creative software industry through persistent innovation and doing what other companies only dream of: fostering indomitable brand loyalty over decades of superb product development. Although there is a risk of competition to the company, its product suite has a solid position to fight off new entrants because of its all-inclusive ecosystem and reliability among enterprise clients. The sellers should not discount the fact that Adobe is one of the most high-margin companies in the world and has a stronger distribution network than most tech firms.\n\nMoreover, the company is making gradual progress with its AI-powered products, and its new pricing approach has the potential to monetize AI sooner than most bears think. It\u2019s probably better to monetize AI at a late stage but do it effectively rather than rush out to monetize AI early and do so without thinking ahead. The stock is currently trading at a fair price and is presenting an attractive entry point for investors with a long-term time horizon. If investors are looking for a neat tech play to add to their portfolios, ADBE is worthy of consideration.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer",

            "content": "Project Neo is an intriguing new initiative from Adobe that could act as one of the first truly effective bridges between 2D apps and 3D design.\n\nWe've written about Project Neo before. It was one of the many highlights of Adobe's Adobe MAX conference in Florida in October last year, and at the just concluded Adobe MAX Japan Adobe said it was off the drawing board and into beta.\n\nEssentially, Project Neo makes it easy to add dimensions and depth to designs, aiming to allow artists trained on 2D tools to move into 3D without having to relearn how to make the wheel. Adobe says it eliminates the need for manual calculations and empowers them to create and edit 3D, volumetric designs with flexibility, control, and precision \u2014 all without requiring any technical expertise in 3D creation tools.\n\nWhat's this going to be good for? Brand and marketing graphics, icons, isometric illustrations and even 3D pixel art. Artists can now bring dimensional, geometric artwork from different perspectives into 2D designs using a familiar, intuitive web-based interface built for graphic designers and integrated into existing workflows.\n\n3D typography can also be incorporated as Project Neo now includes access to over 30,000 fonts from the Adobe Font Library. And, of course, there's an AI angle to it too as Project Neo also allows designers to take control over the layout of images using Adobe\u2019s new Scene to Image technology.\n\nWith the move to the public beta, the software has also added the ability to import 2D SVG files, so artists can easily work directly with Illustrator. This could be rather handy. Vector curves from Illustrator can be imported into Project Neo to be extruded or extended to a third dimension to create a 3D object, while artwork created in Project Neo can be opened in Illustrator as an editable vector file.\n\n\"For example, you could import an SVG logo from Illustrator to Project Neo to finalize the asset,\" writes Adobe. \"Or you could create a wide variety of volumetric designs in Project Neo as options for a client\u2019s brand identity and then bring them to Illustrator to refine them, so they can be used on signage, websites, apparel, and more.\"\n\nYou can find out more at projectneo.adobe.com.

With Adobe Express, however, you can design a logo that harnesses the power of color psychology in just a matter of minutes.\n\nThe Adobe Express free logo maker allows users to generate polished, unique logos without requiring design expertise. By leveraging AI to suggest styles, color schemes, and typography, Express users can craft distinctive logos that align with their vision, ensuring consistency across all branding materials.\n\nResize Image Dimensions Faster and Easier\n\nOptimizing images for different social media platforms can be surprisingly time-consuming\u2014but it's essential for ensuring professional presentation of your business online. Between website templates and Instagram posts, the dimensions required from platform to platform can differ drastically, and maintaining image quality across manual image edits makes this task even harder to manage.\n\nAdobe Express's free image resizer eliminates all of these challenges, namely by allowing users to scale images to specific dimensions for websites, social media, and marketing materials in just a few clicks while preserving sharpness and detail. Simply put, this tool ensures businesses and content creators can maintain a professional, visually cohesive presence across multiple channels without needing to develop technical photo editing skills in advance.\n\nOne-Click Image Background Removing Capabilities\n\nFrom product photography to social media content and marketing visuals, business owners and digital creators have to work with a high volume of image assets today. And given how often you find yourself repurposing the same images across your website, social media profiles, and even across print publications to ensure brand cohesion, it pays to have branded image assets available in multiple file types.\n\nFor instance, PNG files have become every graphic designer's best friend. Known for their higher-quality compression compared to JPEGs and ability to maintain a transparent background, PNG files have proven ideal for sharing brand imagery.\n\nWith Adobe Express' AI-powered one-click image background remover, you can not only convert from JPG to PNG\u2014you can also format those PNG files with transparent backgrounds. This will make your brand image files even cleaner to work with, allowing you to add logos and other branded design elements directly to social media posts, brochure designs, website landing page designs, and a whole range of other different graphic design projects.\n\nIntelligent Tools to Replace and Change Background Elements\n\nIn much the same way as removing an image background, replacing or changing a background can also completely transform a photo. In commercial or business contexts, you can alter image backgrounds to tailor your brand imagery, reinforce a brand message, or simply enhance the aesthetics of any digital content.\n\nThankfully, Adobe Express also includes design tools to help you effortlessly replace or change image backgrounds. Whether you're searching for a clean, professional background for corporate presentations or a vibrant, eye-catching underlay for social media posts, you can find and design the right approach with just a few quick clicks on Adobe Express.\n\nAnd how do Express' AI features play a role here? By leveraging generative AI to automate recommended image backgrounds or optimize images after replacing or changing backgrounds, Adobe Express all but guarantees the most high-quality edits with every design job.\n\nHarness Adobe Express for your Business\n\nWith a 40-year legacy of innovation, Adobe has been supporting creators by offering groundbreaking tools like Adobe Express, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Firefly, as well as a new and evolving family of generative AI models.\n\nBy providing AI tools for easy functionality and output, Adobe Express enables users to focus on creativity rather than getting to grips with technical editing skills. These AI-powered features greatly expand access to high-quality visual content, ensuring businesses and creators of all sizes can compete in an increasingly digital-first world. And best of all, Adobe Express is totally free to use, with premium plans offering advanced features for those seeking additional customization and creative control.\n\nAdobe aims to help its users change the world through personalized digital experiences.

            "content": "Each year, the American Productivity & Quality Center (APQC) carries out a survey to ask supply chain professionals about their organizations\u2019 key priorities and focus areas for the coming year. This year\u2014and for the first time since 2019\u2014we found that supply chain planning is no longer the top area of focus for surveyed organizations.\n\nThis does not mean that supply chain planning no longer matters\u2014it\u2019s still the third-most important overall area of focus. However, respondents told us that they will be focusing even more on sourcing and procurement as well as logistics and inventory management in 2025. APQC\n\nIn this article, we highlight findings from our priorities research about these key areas and provide a preview of where leading supply chain organizations will be focusing and investing resources for 2025.\n\nSourcing and Procurement\n\nSupply chain professionals told us that their top priorities for sourcing and procurement include relationship building with strategic suppliers and digitizing and automating procurement.\n\nOrganizations are Seeking Deeper Relationships with Key Suppliers\n\nSupplier relationship management (SRM) is once again the top priority area within sourcing and procurement, just as it was in 2024. In fact, even more organizations selected SRM as their top priority this year (50% in 2025 versus 32% in 2024). Disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic taught many organizations that their success is closely tied to the success of their suppliers, and numerous ongoing disruptions after the pandemic have only cemented the importance of effective SRM.\n\nHistorically, SRM provided a set of processes and practices to help buyers ensure that third-party suppliers complied with contractual terms, service levels, and performance objectives. The picture has become more nuanced in recent years, however. SRM\u2019s focus is now increasingly on building and sustaining collaborative, mutually beneficial relationships between buyers and their most strategic suppliers.\n\nStrong supplier relationships and the collaboration that comes from them enable organizations to continually innovate and react more quickly to disruption when it occurs. These benefits, in turn, can also enable more effective risk mitigation (the second top priority within sourcing and procurement). For that reason, it makes sense to find that \u201cimproving key supplier relationships\u201d is the top strategy for sourcing and procurement this year (52% of respondents).\n\nDigitizing and Automating Procurement is a High Priority in 2025\n\nAutomation and digitization is another key theme for sourcing and procurement and is the third-highest priority for this area in 2025. The push toward greater automation and digitization not only speaks to a desire for lower costs and greater efficiency, but also to the need for deeper supply chain visibility through advanced analytics and other technologies.\n\nThe strategies that respondents plan to carry out for procurement in 2025 will help support the push toward greater digital transformation. For example, about half of respondents (46%) said their organizations are working to standardize processes\u2014an important first step for applying and using technology effectively. And in some cases, organizations are circling back to redefining their processes when that step was originally missed or incomplete prior to automation. About another third (35%) told us they are implementing new technologies and capabilities for procurement, which will support their digital transformations.\n\nLogistics and Inventory Management\n\nLogistics and inventory management is the second highest overall area of focus for 2025. Compared to last year, supply chain visibility has become an even greater priority within this area (61% of respondents in 2025 versus 47% in 2024). Visibility ensures transparency from the sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of finished products and is crucial for managing extended and outsourced supply chains effectively.\n\nFrom supply shortages to natural disasters, geopolitical conflict, labor disputes, and more, supply chain disruptions showed no signs of becoming more predictable in 2024. Organizations that can achieve deep visibility across their supply chains (including second- and third-tier suppliers) are able to identify unexpected bottlenecks and react more swiftly to disruptions when they occur (even ideally, predict them beforehand). These benefits help organizations to optimize inventory management (the second top priority in this area) while also supporting important priorities like risk mitigation and SRM.\n\nNearly two-thirds of surveyed organizations report that they are focused on inventory optimization to pursue these priorities (62%), while almost half are planning to standardize processes (48%) and implement methods to reduce transportation costs (46%) in 2025.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n\u201cUncertainty\u201d was a keyword for supply chains in 2024\u2014and 2025 may be just as unpredictable. To manage risk and build resilience for the coming year, many supply chain organizations will be working to:\n\n\u00bb Strengthen core areas like sourcing and procurement as well as logistics and inventory management\n\n\u00bb Deepen relationships with their most strategic suppliers\n\n\u00bb Increase visibility across the supply chain\n\n\u00bb Optimize and standardize foundational processes to better support digitization, automation, and deeper visibility\n\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see that around half of respondents are working to standardize the processes that digital technologies support. Technology can\u2019t fix broken processes and workflows\u2014process improvement and standardization should be top strategies for any supply chain organization in 2025.",

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAdobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.39 points to a change of +10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.03 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues",

Even for early filers, the road to the tax deadline can be one of the most stressful times for individuals and small business owners alike. According to a new Adobe US survey*, an overwhelming majority of SMB owners (77 percent) and consumers (80 percent) plan to file their taxes either very early or early. Why? Peace of mind so they\u2019re not stressed and can focus on other priorities (SMBs: 52 percent; consumers: 49 percent).\n\nThe survey further explored what SMBs and consumers think about preparing their taxes, with questions ranging from \u201dHow confident do you feel about preparing your taxes?\u201d to \u201cHow do you describe you experience working with tax forms?\u201d to \u201cHave you ever used AI to prepare your taxes?\u201d\n\nThere were common themes across both audiences:\n\nWorking with tax forms is grueling, analogous to medieval torture!\n\nCracking the ever-changing code of tax rules is the top challenge.\n\nTaxpayers think AI can help make filing easier (with a few caveats).\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the survey insights by audience:\n\nFor small business owners\n\nLast year, the U.S. averaged 430,000 new business applications per month, marking a 50 percent increase from 2019. Interest in starting a small business has been booming, which means more first-time entrepreneurs will be tackling taxes from a whole new perspective. Going from an individual taxpayer to a business can be exciting. However, it can also come with a learning curve as many business owners are navigating this complicated process for the first time.\n\nAccording to the research, tax-related forms are the most common type of documents that SMB owners signed in the past year (75 percent). Yet, more than half (52 percent) feel only \u201csomewhat confident\u201d or \u201cnot confident\u201d about preparing their taxes. Solopreneurs and small business owners deal with some tricky tax considerations, like figuring out what counts as a deductible expense vs. what doesn\u2019t \u2014 think startup costs, raw materials, office supplies, travel and salaries. Plus, making sense of IRS documents, like the Tax Guide for Small Business, can feel overwhelming. It\u2019s no wonder that 41 percent of SMB owners compare their experience working with tax forms to a \u201cmedieval torture device,\u201d with understanding complex tax regulations and rules (#1), shuffling through a lot of paper docs (#2) and combining all tax-related documents for their tax advisors (#3) as the top stressors.\n\nSmall businesses are increasingly turning to AI to help them work more efficiently and taxes are no exception. According to the survey, they see convenience (53 percent) and speed (45 percent) as top benefits. Similar to larger companies, SMBs also voiced concerns about using AI solutions for their taxes, citing accuracy and reliability (59 percent) as well as data security and privacy (55 percent) are their top concerns.\n\nFor consumers\n\nSimilar in sentiment to SMB owners, more than a third (39 percent) of consumers described working with tax forms as akin to a \u201cmedieval torture device,\u201d with their top pain points being understanding complex tax regulations and rules (#1), shuffling through a lot of paper documents (#2) and combining all tax-related documents for their tax advisor (#3). As a result, more than half (52 percent) only feel \u201csomewhat confident\u201d to \u201cnot confident\u201d about preparing their taxes.\n\nNavigating tax regulations can be challenging, especially when it comes to navigating and finding answers in, say, an IRS Form 1040 regarding individual tax deduction rules. More than a third (35 percent) of consumers want technology that helps them simplify complex language.\n\nAlmost mirroring the SMB insights about AI, while consumers see benefits like speed (45 percent) and convenience (54 percent) in using AI for tax prep, a near majority (83 percent) of them have never used AI to prepare their taxes, citing concerns like data security and privacy (46 percent) and accuracy and reliability (28 percent).\n\nAdobe Acrobat brings peace of mind to tax prep\n\nWhile digital and AI tools can never replace a trusted tax pro, Adobe Acrobat offers tools that can take much of the pain out of the process for individuals, freelancers and small business owners, helping simplify tax filing, improve accuracy and maximize deductions. Acrobat\u2019s AI-powered features are governed by data security protocols and developed in alignment with Adobe\u2019s Ethics principles so every customer can use them with confidence.\n\nFor more details about this year\u2019s tax brackets, filing deadlines and how to organize your tax documents, visit the 2025 Adobe Acrobat tax guide.

Real-Time CDP Collaboration addresses this by providing advertisers and publishers a secure environment to collaborate on first-party data, which is inherently consent-driven and anchored in trusted customer relationships. Brands can identify high-value audiences and activate campaigns, all without moving or exposing directly identifiable customer data.\n\nAdobe unveiled Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as its latest publisher partner for Real-Time CDP Collaboration. This partnership enables advertisers to discover new audiences based on consumer preferences within WBD properties. Advertisers can then activate relevant campaigns across the WBD portfolio of brands. \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with Adobe on this innovative first-party data solution,\u201d said Ryan Gould, president of U.S. advertising sales, go to market, Warner Bros. Discovery. \u201cLeveraging these dynamic tools will empower advertisers to maximize their campaigns' success across our premium content portfolio by delivering curated brand experiences to consumers in privacy-centric, contextually relevant ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cReal-Time CDP Collaboration is a major unlock for our clients, and the ease of use is unmatched,\u201d said Giuseppe Cagliostro, Global Client Lead, GroupM Wavemaker. \u201cIt eliminates hours of time we usually spend on creating a data clean room, with an intuitive user interface that delivers meaningful audience insights used to plan campaigns, execute with greater speed and measure the impact of media buys.\u201d\n\nBuilt on Adobe Experience Platform, which provides a single view of customers across every channel, Real-Time CDP Collaboration is purpose-built for brands to connect and collaborate on first-party data. In addition to creating new high-value audiences and driving more relevant campaigns, users can measure ad effectiveness directly with publishers that now include NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery. Adobe also offers a flexible solution where customers can securely connect data across ecosystem partners including Snowflake and Amazon Web Services (AWS), and identity partners including Acxiom, LiveRamp, TransUnion and The Trade Desk.\n\n\u201cThe move away from third-party signals such as Internet cookies has presented an opportunity for brands to make better use of their first-party data, driving more relevant ad experiences based on direct customer relationships,\u201d said Sundeep Parsa, vice president of product, Adobe Experience Cloud. \u201cBy enabling tighter collaboration between advertisers and publishers within a privacy-centric environment, this latest offering in Adobe Experience Cloud is filling in gaps left by third-party data sources and empowering brands to deliver ads that resonate with customers.\u201d\n\nWith Real-Time CDP Collaboration, brands can:\n\nConnect with trusted partners: From a centralized application, advertisers and publishers can connect and collaborate with intuitive dashboards that instantly surface insights on audience overlap and opportunities for customer acquisition, retargeting or suppression.

            "content": "Many ministers wonder if in retirement they\u2019ll run out of money before they run out of life?\n\nGood question.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to consider the scenario of running out of life, even if there\u2019s plenty of money. Both are important considerations about retirement that require being proactive.\n\nMinisters are certainly not immune to the first consideration.\n\nBut the second impacts us every bit as much.\n\nThe three \u201cP\u201d rule\n\nI served for more than sixteen years with GuideStone Financial Resources (the employee benefits agency of Southern Baptists) and assisted thousands of pastors and other ministers with their retirement accounts in individual appointments, onsite group meetings, and online seminars.\n\nSome pastors and ministers I met exhibited some skewed thinking about money, finances, and retirement. A banker once told me that the \u201cThree \u2018P\u2019 Rule\u201d was fairly common knowledge among bankers: Never loan money to poets, painters, or pastors.\n\nThat\u2019s sad for all three, but particularly for pastors.\n\nIn a brief, insightful article a few years ago, pastor Bill Newton wrote \u201cWhy banks see pastors as bad credit risks.\u201d I urge you to read it.\n\nOf course, being a bad credit risk is not true of all pastors, but the \u201cone bad apple\u201d rule often impacts others. A pastor\u2019s integrity is vital to every facet of life.\n\n3 notes for retiring pastors\n\nI want to focus for a few minutes on retirement.\n\nSome pastors have interesting ideas about it. With each point below, I have included a link to more detailed information. I encourage you to read this entire article first, and then click on links about which you\u2019d like more information.\n\nFirst, some ministers see themselves as never retiring.\n\nBut the reality is that not many churches are willing to have seventy-five-plus-year-old pastors, especially if they are in bad health.\n\nGranted, part-time service in a church may be possible, but will it provide sufficient income? (Which becomes especially challenging if a minister has opted out of Social Security. See my next point below.) Most of us will need 75 percent (or greater) of our pre-retirement income in retirement.\n\nOf course, God\u2019s call on a minister\u2019s life doesn\u2019t end at Social Security\u2019s full retirement age.\n\nFailing to plan for retirement can mean you\u2019re planning to fail. But if pastors have been financially wise and frugal, \u201cretired\u201d ones are freer than ever to do everything God has called them to do and go anywhere he sends them.\n\nRetirement doesn\u2019t mean quitting ministry. In the best-case scenario, it simply means you don\u2019t need to be paid any longer.\n\nNext, some ministers have \u201copted out\u201d of Social Security.\n\nThis option is available briefly to ministers after ordination. But it\u2019s available only to those who conscientiously object to the government providing public insurance to citizens, not to those who simply object to paying the 15.3 percent self-employment tax. Most pastors I know don\u2019t meet this requirement. A minister is required to sign an IRS document attesting to this objection.\n\nOpting out of Social Security is irrevocable and it eliminates the eligibility of benefits for your family if you should die young or become disabled. It also eliminates eligibility for Medicare at age sixty-five unless you have enough credits earned in Social Security in non-ministerial employment.\n\nUnless ministers who have opted out have aggressively saved for retirement (15 percent or greater of total income) or purchased additional disability and life insurance to protect their families, many find themselves in desperate financial situations in retirement.\n\nAt retirement, most ministers I know who opted out of Social Security have regretted it.\n\nFinally, retirement is as much about health, relationships, and purpose as it is about finances.\n\nIf at retirement your health is poor, your relationships weak or fractured, and/or your sense of purpose in retirement unclear, then it will be challenging, even if you have sufficient income.\n\nSo, across employment years, ministers must not only save for retirement but regularly exercise, eat right, and find ways to release stress if they want to experience retirement years as \u201cgolden.\u201d\n\nMinisters also should take good care of their primary relationships\u2014family and friends\u2014and not be continuously absent or consumed by the needs of parishioners.\n\nAs well, each of us must have projects, goals, and aspirations for our retirement years. I remember hearing it said that many newly retired pastors\u2019 wives often felt they had \u201ctoo much husband and not enough income.\u201d Our spouses likely don\u2019t need us to micromanage their lives.\n\nDefining a great retirement\n\nSo, what will your retirement years be like?\n\nEngaging? Secure? Fulfilling?\n\nIt\u2019s common wisdom to begin with the end in mind, retirement included. Personally, I don\u2019t have to look very far to see a good example of a great retirement.\n\nMy godly, ninety-year-old mother delivers meals to the \u201celderly.\u201d After Dad died, she moved to a senior living community and still lives independently. Graduated care is available whenever she may require it. She and Dad purchased long-term care insurance decades ago, which has served them exceedingly well, especially in Dad\u2019s declining years. My mother\u2019s well-being is no accident or happenstance.\n\nShe\u2019s made a world of new friends. She goes to social functions regularly. She sends me texts every single day. She\u2019s active in church and continually reads. She\u2019s always asking how she can help. Her five grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren adore her. She\u2019s generous and kind. And fun and funny. Psalm 92:14 describes her well, \u201cThey still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green.\u201d\n\nYet, her eyesight is failing and her hearing is frustrating. Her arthritis is painful, and her scoliosis bends her over. Celiac disease limits what she can eat. She often requires a cane to walk. But she doesn\u2019t let these \u201cmomentary afflictions\u201d define or confine her. She prepared for these eventualities and is living with few to no regrets.\n\nShe and Dad scrimped and saved during their work years. They worked hard and prayed harder, always with the end in mind. They were faithful to each other and to the Lord. My brother and I have advanced college degrees because during our childhood years they set the example and made the sacrifices necessary for us to go to college. They always exercised, ate wisely (even when that wasn\u2019t vogue), and found ways to be hopeful in hard times.\n\nDad died with dementia a few years ago, but, not surprisingly, my mother pressed on. She is the epitome of Isaiah 40:31: \u201cBut they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve heard it said that every end is also a new beginning. Think of retirement that way.\n\nIt can be the beginning of a wonderful season of life\u2014even for ministers and pastors.\n\nThe power of retirement savings is in compounding returns on investments over time. Non-monetary investments\u2014health, attitude, and relationships\u2014compound, too.\n\n\u201cInvest\u201d wisely.",

            "content": "Chris Fisher is a Managing Principal at consulting and M&A advisory company Ducker Carlisle. There, he is responsible for Global Commercial Team while also leading the firms Building and Construction industry practice. Fisher holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Management from Purdue University and an MBA with specialization in global economics from Indiana University. He is an active participant and speaker among many construction and industrial industry groups and has testified as an expert before the Federal Trade Commission and often presents at analyst days and board meetings.\n\nForConstructionPros.com connected with Fisher early December 2024 about the 2025 year and potential trends in construction.\n\nQ. What trends do you see happening in residential and commercial construction?\n\nDucker Carlisle If we unpack residential construction, the first lens to look through is both single family construction and multifamily construction. We do have a housing shortage in the US, but that's really an affordability issue. It\u2019s also because, in some cases, we aren't able to or our builders choose not to build homes less than $350,000 and we have a tremendous demand for homes in the $200,000 to $250,000 level. That's a structural challenge to our industry.\n\nWhere you see opportunity is when you look at regional or state level. The southern states have high levels of demand for housing [and] housing construction costs are a bit lower, so you'll see growth in single family in those regions. As a contractor, I'm thinking about geolocation emphasis of opportunity and single family developments and then the return to multifamily probably later in 2025 because of the gestation cycle of a multi family project and the funding mechanism as interest rates come down.\n\nIn commercial, there's a couple areas we'll still see continued growth:\n\nData centers is a significant category where you need a very specific building type. You need a very specific power generation base, and we're going to see continued growth of new facilities in data centers.\n\nThe reshoring or optimizing manufacturing locations probably later in the term.\n\nGrowth in manufacturing both small, medium and large manufacturing facilities, as the emphasis is to produce or make in America or make in America with supply chains.\n\nWe're anticipating growth in what we call sort of recreational hotel, motel and other areas because we've been spending on experiences. We've been to go back to build even for what we see in manufacturing, oil and gas having different hotels and different levels of restaurants to serve rural or urban areas.\n\nQ. The pandemic saw a growth in decorative concrete as homeowners invested in improving their own homes. With growth in residential construction, do you think we\u2019ll also see a similar growth in the decorative side and outdoor living areas as well?\n\nAbsolutely. I think coming out of COVID, one of the hottest areas of the construction industry was outdoor living. There was a demand from hardscapes to landscapes to pavers to concrete staining and decorative areas for outdoor living was significant. We've created an expectation for our home owners and renters and homes to have a beautiful and active outdoor living area. That will continue through, I would say the next decade as that's a design and living preference because we still have a lot of work from home. A lot of people are still working from home or pursuing a balanced mix - that outdoor living is important.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that as interest rates come down we will re-engage the existing home sales market. One of the ways to attract a higher price if you're trying to sell your home is to optimize your outdoor living environment. We've seen that in paving sales or pergola sales etc. When homeowners purchase a home, the [following] 24 months is a huge spike in home improvement spending and they typically are doing kitchens, baths, and outdoor living activities.\n\nThose are two areas that I think will continue as we see the impact of lower interest rates and allows people to move.\n\nQ. Are there any trends anticipated to go down at all?\n\nI think there's a couple. In terms of the risks, there's several risks to watch. Now, the impact we don't know yet, but - again - the construction industry is very much a localized market. In a market that doesn't have an optimized mix of population, good levels of employment or GDP and investment for growth, then you might be on a decline of the market, because of the lack of a lack of demand - even though interest rates may be getting better or overall the nation is improving its GDP outlook. That's something to look out for.\n\nThe other is if we don't pursue the immigration and border strategy correctly. A deportation event that impacts construction labor significantly will reduce the number of projects started and or completed or defer them further.\n\nIt is my belief that there'll be targets that are more in urban areas or of criminal background nature not going after a significant construction trade group at this point. But we don't know until we start to see that happening. That's certainly a risk.\n\nHistorically, within the construction industry, it's been levels of demand which have the biggest cycles of demand and how steep the curve was creates the biggest implication. But we don't. We've just been through COVID and came through that all right. We've just been through a high inflationary environment and we're coming through that, all right. Now it's an even keel level of demand, it will seem satisfying to most.\n\nQ. What advice would you have for contractors to follow that demand if they are in one of the markets that aren\u2019t seeing high growth? What might be some advice for the contractors looking to expand their area?\n\nI think a lot of contractors do that today because it's been happening over the years, as we've seen higher population and density of home construction or building construction occurred in the South \u2013 for example Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Texas - but it's really around a contractor either building a partnership with another contractor in a different market that has high demand.\n\nOftentimes they may be limited on labor, and so you can work with and build partnerships. You can go acquire a contractor in a different high demand market. Or you can enter a new market yourself and build a build relationships and win business there.\n\nThe trick is to do your homework on looking at those local markets and where you feel you have the best opportunity and what fits with your business and culture.\n\nQ. How do you think the next four years of Trump's administration will affect labor in construction?\n\nThe demand outlook and increased levels of activity in construction across all levels of residential, nonresidential, and infrastructure creates a rising tide that lifts all boats. That creates an opportunity to attract labor into the trades at the same at the same time we were starting to see. It'll be further expanded under the administration in a respect and appreciation for pursuing the trades as a career for life vs. necessarily having to follow the historic path of university/college or 2 year and participate in in office environment job.\n\nNow, we've got a premise of either blue collar or construction trade and very specialized skilled craftsman is something that is worth investing in and building as a career and recognized and set up further than it was maybe years before.\n\nI think that's those are positive and different than what we've had before. The risk is if we go too far, too fast we take too much of the immigration pool or labor pool out. That will be a disruptive event for the industry.\n\nQ. Are you optimistic for 2025 for construction?\n\nAbsolutely. I have been in the industry for almost 30 years, we haven't had a series of positive trends and dynamics all converging at once.\n\nWe've got inflation of materials coming down. We've got interest rates also coming down. We've got a lending market opening up - especially for bigger projects. We have an administration that is looking to reduce regulatory influence on project or project execution. We have an optimistic consumer who also has some level of good financial capabilities to move or spend - which is very healthy for the industry. We've got some level of domestic infrastructure needs. We have this tailwind in infrastructure spending. If you look at the bond passage for a lot of communities in the last 12 months or 2 years, a lot of those bonds are going to be fueling continued projects.\n\nAll of those create a very favorable and optimistic environment for the next couple years.\n\nQ. Are there any other issues that you would like to comment towards? Any final thoughts?\n\nWhat's interesting is that people aren't talking about sustainability as much anymore. It's been important but in the last 12 months, you're not hearing much about that anymore. You're not seeing the legislative priorities, other rebates, of focus on sustainability or energy efficiency or renewables. That's something to watch for.\n\nIt may come back, but that's not a priority as it once was. That changes the dynamic a bit of how we build and what we build in the construction industry.\n\nI think you'll see different levels of investment in areas and will take a longer. It\u2019s like we're seeing in the automotive industry with EV production and mandates, those will be looked at, but we still need to have clean air in our buildings, we still need to have energy-efficient operating facilities of buildings. We still have climate impact of storms on homes and replacement. It's just a different a shifting perspective for the long term.",

Photoshop was introduced by Thomas and John Knoll to provide powerful digital image editing tools to edit and enhance photographs. What started as a niche tool for editing scanned images soon became an essential part of creative workflows.\n\n\u00a9 Jeff Schewe.\n\n1989-91: Photoshop Enters Hollywood\n\nBefore its official launch, an early version of Photoshop was used in the visual effects of The Abyss (1989). Co-creator John Knoll, who worked as a visual effects supervisor on the film, utilized Photoshop to help craft the groundbreaking water pseudopod sequence. This marked Photoshop\u2019s first venture into Hollywood, paving the way for its major role in Terminator 2: Judgment Day just a few years later. Photoshop's advanced features, like layers (introduced in 1994) and non-destructive editing, offered filmmakers unprecedented control over visual effects and post-production work.\n\n1994: Layers Revolutionize Digital Design\n\nPhotoshop 3.0 introduced Layers, a game-changing feature that allowed users to separate and manipulate different elements of an image independently. This single innovation set a new precedent for digital design workflows.\n\n1995: Non-Destructive Editing becomes the standard\n\nThe introduction of Adjustment Layers, Blend Modes, and Layer Masks transformed how artists edited images, enabling them to make changes to color, brightness, and contrast without altering the original image.\n\n\u00a9 Wayne Palmer.\n\n1998-9: A Household Name\n\nThe release of Photoshop 5.0 in 1998, which introduced the History Panel and Layer Effects, marked a turning point in mainstream adoption. These features made complex edits more accessible, fueling Photoshop\u2019s widespread use in advertising, print media, and emerging online content. By the late \u201890s, Photoshop had established itself as a widely recognized tool in both professional and creative spaces, shaping digital imagery and pop culture alike.\n\nCelebrating our first decade together\n\nTo our earliest adopters and pioneers, thank you for being brave and bold and seeking new ways to enrich your creative workflows. You saw and embraced Photoshop\u2019s potential from the beginning.

            "content": "Happy birthday, Adobe Photoshop. The world\u2019s most famous photo editing software turns 35 years old today, and Adobe is marking the occasion by looking back at landmark moments in Photoshop\u2019s illustrious history.\n\nNo matter how photographers feel about Adobe or Photoshop, there is no denying its influence on photography. The software is so ubiquitous in a photographer\u2019s toolkit that its name has become a verb. When someone says an image is \u201cPhotoshopped,\u201d everyone knows what that means. Much like a bandage is a Band-Aid, an MP3 player was an iPod, and to the NFL\u2019s chagrin, any tablet is an iPad, there\u2019s no mistaking what it means to \u201cPhotoshop\u201d something, whether or not Photoshop was the application of choice. That said, for most professional photography work, there\u2019s a pretty good chance Photoshop was used.\n\nPhotoshop\u2019s Early Years\n\nWhile brothers Thomas and John Knoll developed what would become Photoshop in 1987 and sold the license to Adobe Systems Incorporated the following year, Photoshop 1.0 did not hit the market until February 19, 1990. If photographers think they\u2019ve got it bad now, Photoshop 1.0, which was exclusively available for Macintosh, retailed for $895. In today\u2019s dollars, that\u2019s over $2,200.\n\nAt this time, the Knoll brothers received a royalty for each copy sold, an arrangement that persisted until they sold the rights to Adobe for a cool $34.5 million in 1995.\n\nWhen Photoshop 3.0 arrived in 1994, it brought with it layers, a \u201cgame-changing feature that allowed users to separate and manipulate different elements of an image independently,\u201d as Adobe describes it. This feature has remained integral to Adobe Photoshop ever since and \u201cset a new precedent for digital design workflows.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, Adobe took layers further by adding Adjustment Layers, Blend Modes, and Layer Masks. These enabled photographers and other digital artists to adjust brightness, contrast, and color without changing the original image. Non-destructive editing, like layers, was a groundbreaking addition to the early Photoshop that has become standard in digital photo editing workflows.\n\nGoing Mainstream and Becoming Better for Photographers\n\nWhile Photoshop carved out a strong, passionate user base in its early years, it wasn\u2019t until Photoshop 5.0 in 1998 that it gained traction with a broader audience. New features and tools like the History Panel and Layer Effects made Photoshop 5.0 more user-friendly and accessible, lowering its barrier to entry. More users, including those in advertising, print media, and the burgeoning digital media landscape, could use Photoshop for their creative work.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to believe Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) has just always been part of Photoshop, it hasn\u2019t \u2014 it has just been there for a very long time. When Photoshop became part of the then-new Adobe Creative Suite in 2003, Adobe integrated ACR into Photoshop. Between this new non-destructive RAW image editing inside Photoshop and the healing brush tool that arrived the year prior, Adobe Photoshop quickly became an even more powerful platform for digital photographers.\n\nAnother photographer-friendly innovation was Adobe Photoshop Lightroom\u2019s arrival in 2007. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, now known as Lightroom Classic, launched 17 years to the day after Photoshop 1.0 and completely transformed the digital photography landscape.\n\nThe Age of Automation\n\nFollowing the controversial, albeit financially lucrative, move to ditch one-time purchases and lifetime licenses in favor of Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions in 2013, Adobe continually added new features and tools to Photoshop. Over the past decade, machine learning and artificial intelligence have played key roles in Photoshop\u2019s development. Highlights include Select Subject in 2018 and Generative Fill in 2023. AI has also given birth to features like Neural Filters, automatic masking, and (mostly) improved removal and content-aware fill tools.\n\n\u201cWhile it was fun to commemorate Photoshop\u2019s 35th birthday and reflect on how far we\u2019ve come, it\u2019s more exciting to look forward and shape the future of creativity with you, our community,\u201d Adobe writes. \u201cWe remain committed to building products that empower you to create anything you can imagine. Your passion and feedback fuel product innovation, so we hope you\u2019ll continue this journey with us.\u201d\n\nImage credits: Featured image by \u00a9 Jeff Schewe.",

            "content": "Adobe's Photoshop software is so prevalent today that the name itself has morphed into a verb that refers to the process of editing an image in any given software. Over the years, Photoshop has acquired editing and AI-based features that weren't even dreamed of by the early adopters of the software. Most digital photographers cannot remember a time when the program didn't exist since its existence predates the widespread adoption of digital photography by almost a decade.\n\nIn celebration of the 35-year anniversary of the launch of Photoshop, Adobe has announced an all-new video series on YouTube featuring Russel Preston Brown, Sr. Principal Designer, who is Adobe\u2019s longest-standing employee. Russel has been at the company for 40 years. The new video series is intended to celebrate inspiring stories and images from professional photographers. The pilot episode is available today and features an interview with photographer Joel Grimes, who is recognized as a Canon Legend Photographer and FJ Westcott Top Pro Elite photographer.\n\nScreen shot of an early generation of Adobe Photoshop. Image provided by Adobe\n\nThe video shows a discussion between two longtime friends who discuss how photography and the process of developing images has changed over the decades. The pair discuss how images were edited in the film days and how Adobe developed digital tools that mimicked processes done by hand in the darkroom. At one point the pair discuss how today's technology can produce better results from old negatives than was possible in the film days. Grimes states:\n\nYou made your negative. You made your print and you would lose this huge amount of detail in the difference between what the negative had (and what) the print could (display). The beauty of today is even if I have my old negatives which I went back and re-scanned. I brought them into Photoshop and I manipulated the tones and I ended up with images that I never even dreamed I could have had 33 years ago. So you've taken a negative and enhanced it beyond what it was originally. We've gone beyond the dark room.\n\nAdobe has also released a blog post that shows the major milestones that Photoshop brought to users over the years including features we may take for granted today such as nondestructive editing through the use of Layers and the ability to quickly correct skin blemishes with the Healing Tool. Photoshop can be accessed via subscription through Adobe's Creative Cloud.",

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.16%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.08%.\n\nThe software maker's shares have seen an increase of 6.36% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.76% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.37%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Adobe Systems in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on March 12, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $4.97, reflecting a 10.94% increase from the same quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $5.65 billion, indicating a 9.11% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $20.39 per share and a revenue of $23.45 billion, representing changes of +10.69% and +9.04%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Adobe Systems. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Adobe Systems presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Adobe Systems is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.76. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 29.78 of its industry.\n\nOne should further note that ADBE currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.83. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate.

For comparison, a single subscription to Photoshop typically costs $9.99 a month alone.\n\nOK, it\u2019s not quite as cheap as when I saw a similar deal over Black Friday and Cyber Monday, where it was about five bucks cheaper, but still represents a significant saving. If you\u2019re constantly using a lot of Adobe tools as part of your workflow, or plan to over 2025, this deal is worth a look.

            "content": "February 19, 1990: Adobe ships the first commercial version of its soon-to-be-iconic Photoshop photo editing software. The Photoshop launch, exclusively on the Macintosh, gives users powerful new tools for tweaking digital images.\n\nThe groundbreaking software debuts for Mac System 6.0.3. Priced at $895, Photoshop will quickly become the standard editing tool for graphics professionals. Whether they work for advertising agencies, news organizations \u2014 or, frankly, anywhere else \u2014 Photoshop users take advantage of the program\u2019s digital darkroom tools to seamlessly manipulate images.\n\nPhotography will never be the same.\n\nPhotoshop launch: From ILM to Adobe\n\nBrothers Thomas and John Knoll developed Photoshop. Thomas Knoll began developing the software as a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in 1987, three years before the Photoshop launch. Discovering that his Macintosh Plus computer would not display grayscale images correctly, he started coding a program to help.\n\nThomas\u2019 brother John ran the special effects department at George Lucas\u2019 Industrial Light and Magic. Together, they developed Thomas\u2019 brainchild into an image-editing program they called Display. They later renamed it Image-Pro, then Photoshop. The Knolls completed the first alpha version, Photoshop 0.63, in October 1988. However, they never released that version to the public.\n\nAdobe Systems purchased the program, then released it in February 1990 as Adobe Photoshop, a standalone software application. Once Photoshop hit the mass market, it changed image editing forever.\n\nPhotoshop on Mac changes the image-editing game\n\nCompared to today\u2019s Photoshop, version 1.0 seems, unsurprisingly, quite primitive. Still, the Photoshop launch represented an enormous leap forward compared to other graphics applications available at the time. Version 1.0 boasted revolutionary tools like the Lasso and Magic Wand, which made it easy to select and copy image elements.\n\nMuch like the concerns over AI-generated \u201cdeepfakes\u201d today, Photoshop woke people to the ways in which computers could be used to manipulate images. In 1990, the year Adobe released Photoshop 1.0, photography critic Fred Ritchin wrote:\n\n\u201c[As] the public begins to perceive photography as unreliable, those who control its uses should clearly understand what they are doing to a photograph. They should address both the question of image manipulation by the computer and the more general tendency to use photographs to illustrate preconceived ideas and self-fulfilling prophecies.\u201d\n\nFor a fun trip down memory lane, check out this InfoWorld article about the Photoshop launch from early 1990. It compares Adobe\u2019s software to the other advanced graphics editor of the time, Letraset\u2019s ColorStudio.\n\nThe piece does a good job of summarizing just what a game changer Photoshop was at the time. Even if, as the author noted, it was \u201ca fairly big program \u2026 [taking up] about 2 megabytes.\u201d\n\nPhotoshop sets a new standard\n\nIn the years that followed the Photoshop launch, the software became a standard application for anyone who works with graphics. Today, more than two dozen versions later, Adobe sells Photoshop as subscription software and bundles it into its Creative Cloud suite. And the iPad version of Photoshop continues to add desktop-class features.\n\nAdobe donated the original source code for Adobe Photoshop 1.0 to the Computer History Museum in February 2013.\n\nWhile other image editors rose to challenge it over the years, Photoshop remains the gold standard for many people. And it all started with the Photoshop launch on the Mac on this day in 1990.\n\nDo you remember the Photoshop launch or use Photoshop 1.0 back in the day? What are your memories of this game-changing piece of software? Let us know in the comments below.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Adobe does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Adobe's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth February 18th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Adobe is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.3% and 4.7% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The complexity of modern supply chains has reached a critical point. With global networks spanning multiple systems, data sources, and stakeholders, organizations face unprecedented challenges in making timely, informed decisions. While data availability has grown exponentially, the ability to transform this data into actionable insights hasn't kept pace. A new solution is emerging in the form of AI agents, serving as intelligent translators between complex data and business decisions.\n\n2025 is being hailed as the \u2018year of agents\u2019 by the world\u2019s biggest tech companies including Nvidia and OpenAI. AI agents represent a fundamental shift from traditional automation tools. These specialized digital systems can autonomously handle complex analytical tasks while collaborating with each other and human experts. Unlike simple automation tools that follow predefined rules, agents can learn, adapt and handle nuanced decision-making across the supply chain.\n\nThe Potential Impact of AI Agents in Supply Chain\n\nData Integration and Analysis\n\nSupply chains generate data across multiple systems - from ERP platforms to market data to macroeconomic indicators. While all this data could improve decision-making, organizations struggle to harmonize it effectively.\n\nAI agents can provide a layer of automation that continuously harmonizes this data, automatically handling unit conversions, mapping product codes, and integrating external data sources. This allows supply chain teams to focus on making decisions rather than spending weeks reconciling data formats.\n\nSpeed Through Automation for Better Resiliency\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed how critical speed of decision-making is in modern supply chains. While traditional automation helps with routine tasks, AI agents can transform the speed and scale at which organizations can analyze situations and make decisions.\n\nConsider a global manufacturer facing a 60% capacity reduction from a key semiconductor supplier. Instead of spending weeks gathering data and evaluating options manually, AI agents can immediately analyze the situation across multiple dimensions: mapping current inventory positions, identifying available capacity at alternative suppliers, simulating different production scenarios, and calculating the cost implications of each option. What traditionally took weeks can now happen in hours.\n\nThe impact can extend beyond crisis management. In day-to-day operations, agents can continuously monitor and adjust to changing conditions - reconfiguring production schedules based on real-time demand signals, optimizing delivery routes based on current bottlenecks and reallocating inventory across the network. This enables supply chain teams to shift from reactive response to proactive optimization.\n\nDemocratization of Insights\n\nToday, sophisticated supply chain analysis remains the domain of specialists and data scientists. AI agents fundamentally change this by making complex analysis accessible to business users through natural language interactions.\n\nThis natural language interface, combined with agents' analytical capabilities, transforms supply chain planning from a periodic, specialist-driven exercise into an interactive process where decision-makers can explore scenarios and get instant, comprehensive analysis.\n\nGranular Intelligence at Scale\n\nIn traditional supply chain operations, organizations face a constant trade-off: they can either analyze a few products in detail or many products superficially. AI agents eliminate this compromise by enabling both breadth and depth of analysis simultaneously.\n\nConsider a global retail chain envisioning a transformation in its planning processes. Historically, planners might focus detailed analysis on top-selling products in major markets, applying generic forecasting rules to everything else. With AI agents, they could analyze every product in every location with the same depth. For instance, while planning a winter clothing line, agents could simultaneously process:\n\nStore-level historical sales for each size-color combination\n\nLocal weather forecasts and seasonal patterns\n\nPricing and promotion data from neighboring competitors\n\nSocial media sentiment by region\n\nLocal events and school calendars that might impact shopping patterns\n\nWhen demand patterns shift, agents wouldn't just flag the change\u2014they could trace its implications across the supply chain. A trending color in one region might prompt adjustments to production schedules, reallocation of raw materials, and updates to distribution plans. This granular optimization would occur continuously across thousands of products and hundreds of locations.\n\nMost importantly, this granular intelligence would not come at the cost of holistic understanding. While optimizing store-level inventories, agents would maintain awareness of network-wide constraints and objectives, ensuring that local optimizations align with global efficiency goals.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nAs supply chains continue to grow in complexity, AI agents offer a practical way to handle this complexity while maintaining business context and human oversight. Organizations can start by identifying specific areas where agents can add immediate value - whether in demand planning, inventory optimization or procurement.\n\nThe key to successful implementation lies in maintaining business context. AI agents should be grounded in domain knowledge, business rules and physical constraints while being flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. This ensures their recommendations are both innovative and practically feasible.\n\nThe future of supply chain management lies not in replacing human expertise but in augmenting it with AI agents that can handle complexity at scale. As these technologies mature, organizations that effectively integrate AI agents into their operations will be better positioned to handle the challenges of modern supply chain management.",

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Adobe Inc. ( ) share price is up 32% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 15% in that time.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Adobe achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of .\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 24% in the last year, Adobe shareholders lost 15%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period.

So, that's a whole other expense.\"\n\n\n\nA 2021 Connecticut Paraeducator Advisory Council study found most paraeducators make less than $19 an hour and one in five makes $13 to $16 an hour. The state is already grappling with a shortage of teachers and aides.\n\n\n\nA Connecticut Education Association survey last year found 69% of school districts reporting job openings for paraeducators.\n\n\n\nAnother way to help paraeducators would be to raise the minimum wage, more than it was already increased this year. The latest ALICE update shows the number of \"asset-limited, income-constrained, employed\" families grew 13% in 2022, the largest jump in a decade.\n\n\n\nBarry argued creating a living wage would be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\"Rents are outrageous now. You know, rent, utilities are bad,\" Barry outlined. \"Eversource keeps raising rates and it's just terrible. You know, just being able to survive, you need to be making a decent amount of money.\"\n\n\n\nConnecticut's minimum wage is a little over $16 an hour, or an annual income of around $34,000.

Spencer Cox has signed House Bill 267 into law, a controversial measure that takes away the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions.\n\n\n\nMany union workers voiced their concerns and urged Cox to veto the bill, which they contend would damage unions.\n\n\n\nBut the bill's sponsor, state Rep. Jordan Teuscher - R-South Jordan, said he heard from many teachers and other public sector workers in the right-to-work state, who weren't part of a union and felt they didn't have a voice.\n\n\n\nHe said now, the bill will allow them to negotiate their own employment terms.\n\n\n\n\"Teachers talked about where they had an idea, a change that they wanted - in insurance is an example,\" said Teuscher, \"and they went to the administration to ask them about that and the administration said, 'Well, you're going to have to go talk to the union about it.' And so they'd go to the union to talk about it and the union says 'well, you're not a member, we don't really care what you think.'\"\n\n\n\nTeuscher contended the law will make public employers' wages and benefits more competitive.\n\n\n\nHe added that employers will continue to \"value and listen to the priorities\" of union leaders, as they'll still represent a significant portion of workers.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Utah Education Association - a union which represents 18,000 public school teachers - said they're not letting the \"setback\" stop them, and said this moment reinforces the importance of unions.\n\n\n\nWhile lawmakers considered a compromise, they couldn't reach an alternative.\n\n\n\nIn a statement Cox said, \"Utah has long been known as a state that can work together to solve difficult issues. I'm disappointed that in this case, the process did not ultimately deliver the compromise that at one point was on the table and that some stakeholders had accepted.\"\n\n\n\nTeuscher argued that no one worked harder than he did to reach that compromise.\n\n\n\n\"I met daily, multiple times a day with different union leaders,\" said Teuscher, \"to try to get to the end of the road, something that the Senate could be comfortable with and the House could be comfortable with that was short of the ban.\"\n\n\n\nTeuscher contended public employees that like their unions are going to continue being members and have unions advocate on their behalf.\n\n\n\nBut labor groups fear if public entities were resistant to listening to concerns before, now they likely won't listen to a single employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n\n\nA New York City music school's faculty is back in the classroom after a weeklong strike.\n\n\n\nThe Manhattan School of Music's Precollege Program faculty walked off the job after lengthy union negotiations broke down. The teachers have been working without a union contract since last August. While the union has made concessions, it said the school has been reluctant to compromise.\n\n\n\nAdam Kent, president of the Manhattan School of Music Precollege Faculty Union, said they were forced to strike because the school was not taking the union seriously.\n\n\n\n\"We gave them over three weeks. We asked them if they wanted to reconsider their last proposal and they spelled it out that, no, they wouldn't be making any new proposals,\" Kent recounted. \"We gave them two days notice when we actually declared the strike, and their first response was to try to line up 'scabs.'\"\n\n\n\nHe noted the union is heading back to the bargaining table with the hope of getting a cost of living increase aligned with other schools, such as the Mannes School of Music and Juilliard. In a statement, the Manhattan School called the union's actions \"disruptive to student learning\" and argued they have had little or no availability to negotiate. Students, parents and other union members have joined the faculty's picket line.\n\n\n\nWhile this was the first strike, Kent said he cannot say whether it will be the last. He cautioned there could be another, longer strike if the pattern of bargaining continues. He added recent comments from the school's attorney regarding the union's National Labor Relations Board case against the school make him leery about what lies ahead.\n\n\n\n\"The attorney made a comment to us, 'Good luck with your board,' in the context of the eviscerating of all of these federal agencies under the new administration, and we were really chilled by that,\" Kent acknowledged. \"We really saw it as part of this idea of people claiming impunity and taking advantage of the current political climate.\"\n\n\n\nThroughout negotiations, there have been questions about how much money is available for faculty raises. The school has continuously said there are not enough funds for a pay raise, but tax filing data show the school's president and executives received large pay increases last year. Other data indicate the school's tuition has risen 58% since 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n",

            "content": "Check Point\u2019s newly minted CEO, Nadav Zafrir, kicked off the company\u2019s CPX 2025 conference in Bangkok this week with a bold vision for the future of network security, centred on the \u201chybrid mesh architecture\u201d and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered security.\n\nSpeaking at the event\u2019s opening keynote, Zafrir, a veteran in the cyber security industry, underscored the importance of \u201creal security\u201d in a world saturated with buzzwords and hype. He noted that while AI presents both opportunities and challenges, Check Point\u2019s core mission remains the same \u2013 that is, to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive data from increasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\n\u201cWe live in a hyperconnected world, rapidly evolving with the emergence of AI,\u201d said Zafrir. \u201cThis new dimension demands a shift in our approach to security. It\u2019s no longer enough to solely rely on cloud-based solutions. We need a flexible, adaptable framework that empowers organisations to consume security where and when it\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nThis framework, he said, is the hybrid mesh architecture. A departure from the cloud-only secure access service edge (SASE) approach, it allows organisations to integrate on-premise and cloud security offerings. This flexibility allows for a better user experience, enhanced security and better control over cloud costs.\n\nZafrir noted that the hybrid mesh will allow organisations to adapt their security posture to their specific needs, adding that it\u2019s about creating a security fabric which encompasses all endpoints and connections, ensuring consistent protection regardless of location or device.\n\nNataly Kremer, Check Point\u2019s chief product officer, said the hybrid mesh architecture lets organisations move beyond the confines of cloud-centric SASE offerings.\n\n\u201cInstead of forcing all traffic through the cloud, the hybrid mesh allows businesses to dictate the inspection point for each use case,\u201d she said. \u201cThis means organisations can leverage the power of the cloud when needed, while retaining the flexibility to secure traffic locally on-premise, ensuring optimal performance, cost efficiency and, most importantly, security.\u201d\n\nRead more about cyber security in APAC CrowdStrike CTO Elia Zaitsev explains how the company\u2019s multi-agent AI architecture can help enhance analyst efficiency and tackle cyber security challenges.\n\nSophos found three distinct clusters of activity targeted at a high-level government organisation that appeared to be tied to Chinese interests in the South China Sea.\n\nThe National University of Singapore\u2019s Safe initiative has strengthened the security of IT systems and end-user devices while prioritising user experience through passwordless access.\n\nThe chairman of Ensign InfoSecurity traces the company\u2019s journey and how it is leading the charge in cyber security by doing things differently, investing in R&D and engaging with the wider ecosystem.\n\nZafrir noted that while Check Point had been late to the SASE market, the company was able to learn from the mistakes of others and develop the right architecture. \u201cWhen you think about a hybrid mesh, sometimes you want to connect from your branch office to the internet, and you\u2019d want to go through a SASE infrastructure to get the security in the cloud,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut other times, you want flexibility, because you want to go directly from your datacentre to your cloud environment and you don\u2019t want to go through a SASE architecture. And many times, your users need connectivity to the internet, but it\u2019s not always through SASE.\u201d\n\nAt the event, attended by customers and partners across the Asia-Pacific region, Check Point executives also dived deeper into the company\u2019s product roadmap, including innovations in its Quantum, CloudGuard and Harmony product lines, along with advancements in AI-driven security for both on-premise and cloud environments.\n\nThese include the launch of AIOps, a new cloud service designed to predict and prevent network issues before they arise, and enhancements to Check Point\u2019s web application firewall, boasting a 90% reduction in false positives through advanced AI engines.\n\nCheck Point also envisions the rise of the autonomous firewall, where AI makes real-time security decisions based on contextual awareness. \u201cInstead of having thousands of predefined rules, we want to have AI that makes decisions in real time based on context,\u201d said Kremer.\n\nAddressing the growing concern of AI-driven threats, Zafrir acknowledged the nefarious potential of AI in the hands of malicious actors, citing the potential for AI-driven malware and the automation of sophisticated attacks.\n\nHe also pointed to threats around deepfakes, the expanding attack surface, as well as threats to AI models. \u201c[Attackers] can go after your models, steal them and poison the data that feeds your models, which makes it incredibly hard to understand where the output stems from,\u201d said Zafrir, adding that Check Point is developing capabilities to counter such threats, including tools to safeguard AI models and protect against AI-driven attacks.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nEurope is back and means business in the artificial intelligence race. That's the sentiment echoed at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris as France President Macron touted a $112.8 billion investment in AI. The massive investment comes as four of the biggest US tech giants plan to spend $325 billion to further strengthen their AI ambitions in 2025.\n\nFrance's $112.8 billion underscores Europe's desire to take on the US and China, which have dominated the AI debate on innovations and investment in recent years. For starters, the US is receiving praise as part of the $500 billion Stargate project as China appears to have an edge on innovation following DeepSeek's revelation of cost-effective AI models.\n\nCritics of Europe have long argued that the continent has overregulated the tech sector, hindering innovation. Nevertheless, some in the technology sector believe that Europe is headed in the right direction, even though that perception hasn't completely changed.\n\n\"As a European region, at least, we are starting to see global leaders emerge, and that's the thing we really need,\" Victor Riparbelli, CEO of AI video company Synthesia, told CNBC in an interview on Monday.\n\nWhile there appears to be a tussle or fierce competition between nations to spearhead the AI revolution, China has made it clear that it is willing to work with other countries. Beijing insists it is willing and ready to promote development, safeguard security, and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, Zhang Guoqing, AI has become an essential driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. China has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.\n\nCorporations between nations instead of competing against each other to control the spoils are key to unlocking the full advantages of the AI revolution. Likewise, economists at Goldman Sachs expect widespread adoption of generative AI to raise US labour productivity by 15% over the next 10 years. It is also likely to unlock about $4.5 trillion in annual US GDP.\n\nAI economic benefits are anticipated to flow to hardware and infrastructure providers early on. Later, they will spread to platform and application developers, and finally, they will manifest as increases in productivity and efficiency throughout the industry as a whole. According to the Goldman Sachs team, the US AI investment cycle will peak at 2% of GDP before declining as the compute costs of running AI queries and training AI models decline. Investment in AI software was expected to rise gradually over time as end-user adoption rose.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "AAK Personal Care has introduced Lipex SheaLuxe TR, a shea-derived emollient ester positioned as a sustainable alternative to non-volatile silicones in light skin and hair formulations; especially those for skinification of hair, anti-frizz and glass hair trends. The ingredient offers a soft, silky texture with a non-greasy after-feel, making it ideal for leave-on applications, per the company.\n\nFunctional Benefits Comparable to Dimethicone\n\nLipex SheaLuxe TR (INCI: Ethyl Oleate and Ethyl Stearate) exhibits sensory characteristics similar to low molecular weight dimethicone, including comparable viscosity, spreadability and a lightweight feel during and post-application. According to AAK, trials have demonstrated its efficacy in providing key benefits aligned with leading trends such as moisture retention, anti-frizz performance and long-lasting shine under varying environmental conditions.\n\nA sensory evaluation by trained experts found no significant differences between Lipex SheaLuxe TR and dimethicone, with both described as light, dry, highly spreadable and non-greasy, the company reports.\n\nAdditional benefits include:\n\nShort- and long-term reductions in TEWL,\n\nA visible anti-soaping effect,\n\nMiscibility with plant-based oils and butter, and\n\nCompatibility and miscibility with ethanol, making it suitable for sun care oils.\n\nSustainable, Climate Compensated and Traceable\n\nAs AAK explains, Lipex SheaLuxe TR is formulated for sustainability using an eco-friendly process involving low temperatures, non-toxic catalysts and 100% renewable resources. As a readily biodegradable ingredient, it addresses environmental concerns posed by dimethicones.\n\nThe product is sourced through AAK's Kolo Nafaso program, which engages large networks of women shea collectors across several West African countries. This initiative fosters direct trading partnerships, provides micro-credits and supports socio-economic and environmental development within the communities.\n\nLipex SheaLuxe TR also stands out as a climate-compensated ingredient. The carbon footprint from its production, covering all stages from shea collection to factory gate, is offset with Fairtrade and Gold Standard carbon credits. This offset program, operated in Burkina Faso, further enhances its sustainable profile by funding energy-saving cookstove projects while supporting community-level climate resilience.\n\nMeeting Market Demands for Sustainable, Ethical Solutions\n\nLipex SheaLuxe TR aims to offer brands a high-performance natural alternative to dimethicones, aligning with consumer demand for sustainable, effective and ethically sourced ingredients. Its multifunctionality and supply chain transparency position it as a versatile solution for innovative skin and hair care formulations.",

            "content": "The recently launched Digital Experience Index from digital and research agencies Bernadette and Watermelon has shed light on a rather gloomy statistic: one in three digital experiences are actively failing users. Nearly half of consumers (49%) feel that brands are \"missing the mark\" with their websites and apps, and 47% struggle to access the support they need.\n\nGiven that 60% of brand interactions now happen online, these figures highlight a pressing issue that designers, developers, and brands should all be aware of. Bad digital experiences aren't just frustrating; they're expensive. The report estimates that poor UX costs brands 8% of their annual revenue, amounting to a staggering \u00a33.07 trillion ($3.8T) globally.\n\nSo, what are brands getting wrong, and how can they move beyond 'good enough' to create digital experiences that truly resonate with users? We asked leading designers to weigh in on the common pitfalls, the standout experiences that set the bar, and what it takes to bridge the gap between functional and fantastic UX.\n\nThe pitfalls of prioritising style over usability\n\nOne of the biggest issues brands face is prioritising style over usability. \"There's still a bit of a dispiriting tendency to prioritise style over substance,\" says Conran Design Group digital designer Hayden Sheppard. \"Whether a digital experience looks good is seen to trump whether that experience is intuitive and seamless for users.\"\n\nIn addition, tight budgets and time constraints often mean that UX refinement is overlooked, and digital platforms are treated as an afterthought rather than a core brand experience. Sheppard also notes that digital experiences are often launched to great fanfare, only to be neglected over time, with little attention given to ongoing maintenance or improvements.\n\nAll images from The Digital Experience Index\n\nUX alone won't solve all your problems\n\nAnother common mistake is the misconception that interface design alone can solve every problem. Koto's Anton Martinez and James Howard argue that a truly effective digital experience is built from deep within the business.\n\n\"Good experiences are a result of a lot of things - product, pricing models, data, business decisions, content, visual design, brand, or technical performance,\" they explain. Many brands also default to established UX patterns to create familiar experiences, but in doing so, they risk making their platforms feel generic rather than distinctive. \"Friction isn't always negative if added in the right place and form,\" they note. \"Finding opportunities to inject personality can add to that uniqueness and, in the context of a digital product, build a memorable brand experience.\"\n\nAccessibility as an afterthought\n\nAccessibility is another major blind spot that continues to hinder digital experiences for a vast number of users. \"It's largely misunderstood and more often treated as a final adjustment or compromise rather than an empowering aspect of design,\" says DesignStudio digital creative director Jordan Sheldrick Devine. When accessibility is deprioritised, brands alienate users who rely on inclusive design features, effectively failing at one of the fundamental purposes of UX - ensuring a seamless experience for everyone.\n\nThe lack of early commitment to accessibility leads to clunky, retrofitted solutions rather than intuitive, integrated experiences. On the contrary, the team at ustwo highlights their work on the Spotscan+ Coach app, which was designed with accessibility at its core from the outset. \"Committing to accessibility early across the product design workflow meant that users with accessibility needs weren't left to fend for themselves. The experience was built to be inclusive from the moment it launched rather than months into the roadmap,\" explains Ustwo Design Principal Taylor Westoby.\n\nIt's important to note that accessibility isn't just about legal compliance; it's a competitive advantage. According to a WebAIM study, over 97% of the top one million websites still fail basic accessibility standards. Arguably, brands that proactively design for accessibility differentiate themselves, fostering loyalty and inclusivity in a way that competitors often overlook.\n\n\"A well-thought-out accessible experience doesn't just help those with disabilities\u2014it improves usability for all users,\" notes Sheppard. Features like high-contrast modes, voice navigation, and clear, intuitive layouts don't just benefit a minority but create a frictionless experience for everyone, including those in temporary or situational limitations (e.g., using a device in bright sunlight or with a broken arm).\n\nThe critical role of user research\n\nThe report and expert insights also reveal that one of the biggest failings in digital experience design is the lack of deep, ongoing user research. \"All too often, people sit in a room discussing what the project should look like without properly understanding the end users and getting their feedback early using a prototype,\" says Signifly managing director Jamie Vaughan.\n\nWhen brands assume they know their audience without direct engagement, they risk developing experiences that frustrate rather than facilitate. Westoby underscores the importance of considering the broader digital landscape: \"When designing digital experiences, you aren't just fighting at a brand level - you're competing for attention against every notification, distraction, and procrastination available.\"\n\nUser research isn't just a one-time task but a continual process. It involves qualitative interviews, usability testing, and analytics to uncover both overt and hidden pain points. Wiedemann Lampe's strategy and innovation director, Alex Lampe, stresses the need for ongoing engagement with users. \"There are two tiers of UX. There is the 'I've read the book, and here are the best practices' approach, and then there is the true design thinking kind that addresses the specific needs, challenges, and opportunities of a brand.\"\n\nFor brands looking to build more engaging digital products, research must move beyond demographics and surface-level surveys. Observational studies, A/B testing, and even ethnographic research can reveal surprising insights into user behaviour. Vaughan advises: \"Start by better understanding your users. Take more time to speak to them, test with them, and understand their needs and wants. Then, take quality time in the design phase to iterate and get feedback before rushing through to development and launch.\"\n\nUltimately, the brands that excel in UX are those that continually refine their experiences based on real user data. From understanding the motivations behind user actions to predicting friction points before they become issues, deep research ensures digital products remain relevant, intuitive, and genuinely useful.\n\nBrands setting the standard\n\nDespite these challenges, some brands have been very successful in designing seamless UX. Fintech and travel brands, including Monzo, Uber, and Booking.com, consistently rank highly because they focus on efficiency, speed, and intuitive interfaces.\n\nSheppard adds: \"Apps that are designed to drive action\u2014like Citymapper, Airbnb, and Monzo\u2014are successful because they prioritise function, speed, and efficiency.\" Again, Monzo, in particular, stands out for its ability to help users take control of their finances in a human-centric way, addressing pain points and making money management more accessible.\n\nE-commerce and subscription services are also demonstrating best-in-class UX. Martinez and Howard highlight Bloom & Wild as a prime example, noting that its seamless user journey, strong brand voice, and rejection of dark patterns make for an experience that \"just works\u2014from order to delivery.\" Meanwhile, Sheldrick Devine points to YouTube Kids, which has been meticulously designed to encourage exploration and learning while minimising frustration, an approach that prioritises both function and accessibility.\n\nBernadette's chief design officer, Jonny Goodall, also highlights the Pizza Express app as an example of a brand delivering a strong digital experience. He says, \"The Pizza Express app experience underpins an exceptional loyalty programme.\n\n\"It feels 100% on brand and offers a range of genuinely useful and delightful features for regular restaurant goers and creates a sense of connection between you and those eating with you, as well as the brand.\" He notes that brands often fail to align their digital interfaces with their core identity, which weakens the overall experience.\n\n\"Sadly, we often see a tech implementation approach in favour of prioritising design\u2014often tech platform templates and design conventions over-standardise the interfaces, and consequently reduce any true brand expression or standout.\"\n\nClosing the gap between good and great UX\n\nSo, how can brands close the gap between good and truly great UX? First, ongoing optimisation is crucial. \"Digital experiences need constant optimisation to ensure they evolve in line with rapidly changing user needs,\" says Sheppard. A clunky experience - even if beautifully designed - will ultimately push users away.\n\nAligning UX with brand strategy is another key factor. \"For UX to truly stand out, it needs to be rooted in the brand's vision, values, and character,\" says Lampe. Establishing clear design principles that connect back to a brand's identity ensures greater consistency and impact.\n\nUser research must also be prioritised throughout the process. \"Start with better understanding your users, take more time to speak to them, test with them, and understand their needs and wants,\" Vaughan advises. Taking time to iterate in the design phase before launching can mean the difference between a 'good enough' experience and one that fosters real engagement and loyalty.\n\nBrands should also embrace a balance between function and friction. \"Not enough friction can turn a seamless experience into something forgettable,\" Lampe notes. The best digital experiences don't just guide users from screen to screen - they do so in a way that feels unique to the brand itself.\n\nLast but certainly not least (which is also kind of the point), accessibility should never be an afterthought. \"Committing to accessibility early across the product design workflow means users with accessibility needs aren't left to fend for themselves,\" says Westoby, ensuring that all users can fully engage with a platform from the outset.\n\nWith UX failures costing brands trillions, the need to bridge the 'experience gap' has never been more urgent. As these insights from leading designers show, great digital experiences aren't just about aesthetics or conversion rates - they're about understanding users, designing with empathy, and ensuring that digital touchpoints feel as good as they function.\n\nBrands that commit to this will create digital experiences worth talking about, worth promoting, and worth returning to again and again.",

Shares have fallen some 15% in the roughly two months since the Q4 results came out.\n\nOne investor known by the pseudonym The Value Edge is not too concerned about the dip, believing that Adobe is following a prudent path that will pay off going forward.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s winners will be dictated by who proliferates the market most effectively today and builds an entrenched user base,\u201d explains Value Edge. \u201cAdobe is a very clear leader in this sense.\u201d\n\nValue Edge notes that Adobe products are pervasive, and widely used for a vast variety of different applications. The investor details that Adobe is working hard to solidify its market share in the AI creation space, and has launched a family of Generative AI products \u2014 Firefly \u2014 that should help further cement its leadership position.\n\n\u201cAdobe\u2019s Firefly AI model and innovative features position it as the defining leader in AI-powered digital creation,\u201d says the investor.\n\nMoreover, the recent decrease has sent ADBE\u2019s Forward PE ratio to historically low levels, which are even more enticing due to the company\u2019s stock repurchases that have decreased the number of outstanding shares on the market.\n\n\u201cAdobe\u2019s stock weakness is an opportunity to accumulate shares in a company with a strong moat and exceptional AI integration,\u201d asserts the investor, who rates Adobe a Strong Buy. (To watch The Value Edge\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWall Street seems to feel pretty comfortable with Adobe as well. With 19 Buy, 7 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings, ADBE holds a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Its 12-month average price target of $580.90 would yield gains over over 25% in the year ahead.

            "content": "If you haven't achieved a net worth north of $1 billion by wisely investing in stocks, there's probably a lot that you can learn from the handful of folks who have.\n\nOne fund manager most investors could learn a lot from is David Tepper, the billionaire who manages the Appaloosa fund. It's delivered an average annual return of more than 28% since its inception in 1993.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Tepper closed an Adobe (ADBE -2.28%) position worth more than $100 million. Also in the fourth quarter, Appaloosa increased its stake in Lam Research (LRCX -3.37%) by 1.15 million shares.\n\nTepper's track record speaks volumes about his ability to pick stocks that outperform, but even the best fund managers make decisions they later regret. Here's a closer look at recent results from these two companies to see if selling Adobe or acquiring Lam Research could be a smart move for your portfolio.\n\nTime to sell Adobe?\n\nShares of the Creative Cloud subscription provider are down about 33% from the peak they set all the way back in 2021. The stock hasn't performed well, but its software business keeps growing. In its fiscal year that ended on Nov. 29, 2024, total revenue rose 11% year over year.\n\nAdobe's bottom line is rising more quickly than sales. Adjusted earnings rose 14.6% in fiscal 2024 to $18.42 per share. GAAP earnings that don't adjust for the $1 billion reverse termination fee Adobe incurred when abandoning its pursuit of Figma, rose just 4.6% to $12.36 per share.\n\nAdobe's main advantage is a strong network effect, not necessarily terrific software. Last October, Photopea, a web-based Photoshop competitor, announced it served users over 1 billion files over the previous 12-month period. Photopea was developed by one guy working alone and is free to use. Four years of Photoshop access will run you more than $1,000.\n\nThere are plenty of less expensive alternatives to Adobe's most popular products, but completing projects with them can be a challenge. For example, the proprietary file type Adobe Illustrator employs is ubiquitous among professional illustrators. As a result, most print shops don't know what to do with an EPS file even though this file type is used by dozens of competing vector art applications.\n\nAdobe's heavy investment in generative artificial intelligence (AI) functions could make its products stickier and offset non-professional users who are no longer willing to pay for expensive, recurring subscriptions. With a strong network effect likely to keep subscribers on board for the foreseeable future, selling this stock now doesn't seem like the right move.\n\nIs Lam Research a buy now?\n\nLam Research is a member of a tiny group of companies that produce advanced etch and deposition equipment used to manufacture semiconductors. Laying down billions of tiny transistors on a silicon wafer requires an incredible level of precision now that they're spaced just a few nanometers apart.\n\nLam Research is in an even more enviable position than most of its peers because it specializes in processes that stack semiconductor components on top of each other. Lam's verticalization expertise allows it to produce equipment used to manufacture high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is an increasingly important component of AI processing. The market for HBM chips is expected to soar from $4 billion in 2023 to $130 billion by 2029.\n\nIn 2024, Lam Research grew adjusted earnings by 23% to $3.36 per share, and investors can reasonably expect more gains in the years ahead. That's because it doesn't necessarily matter which memory chip manufacturer goes on to gain a leading share of the HBM memory chip space. An extremely limited number of etch and deposition equipment manufacturers with verticalization expertise means most of the winners, and losers will end up buying equipment from Lam Research.\n\nLam Research's equipment sales could surge on the back of demand for AI, but the market hasn't seemed to notice yet. At recent prices, you can scoop up shares of this well-positioned picks-and-shovels business for just 21.9 times forward-looking earnings expectations. Following Tepper's lead in this case seems like a very smart move.",

The list is full of notable U.S. names in business and sports\u2014just the latest example of American capital flooding into European sports ownership.\n\nOver a quarter of the new investments\u2014\u00a3144 million ($173 million)\u2014was pledged by an ownership group led by Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora that also includes tech CEOs Sundar Pichai (Google), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), and Shantanu Narayen (Adobe). That group bought a 49% stake in the London Spirit.\n\nAnother group, Knighthead Capital Management, successfully bid \u00a340 million for a 49% stake in the Birmingham Phoenix\u2014a natural outgrowth of its ownership of Birmingham City football club.\n\nKnighthead was also behind Tom Brady buying a stake in Major League Pickleball in 2022 and in Birmingham City football club in 2023. According to a source close to Brady, he came very close to investing in The Hundred with Knighthead, but did not. (Initially, a number of media outlets including Front Office Sports reported that Brady did invest, but that source has clarified that while Brady has made sports investments with Knighthead, he is not an investor in Knighthead.)\n\nOther successful bidders include Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, which owns the Mumbai Indians cricket team, and private equity firms Cain International and Ares Management (the latter of which received approval from NFL owners in December to purchase a 10% stake in the Miami Dolphins).\n\nAfter the investments, the total valuation for the eight teams is \u00a3975 million ($1.17 billion).\n\nWhen the ECB launched The Hundred in 2021, each host county held a 51% stake in its local franchise (both men\u2019s and women\u2019s) and the ECB retained a 49% stake. The ECB auctioned off its stakes in January to raise investment dollars that can \u201csafeguard the future of cricket in England and Wales at all levels.\u201d\n\nRoughly 10% of that is earmarked for recreational cricket, with the remainder going to counties that host \u201cfirst-class\u201d cricket teams, whether they have a team in The Hundred or not.\n\nThe league said the funds will go toward reducing debt, building up reserves, and generating future revenue. And the high-profile ownership doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nIn all, it\u2019s a big sum for a tournament that only runs in July and August.\n\nCricket tournaments are traditionally long affairs, with some lasting at least three days. But the ECB, aiming to grow the game on the island of its birth, has a history of innovating. In 2003, it created T20 cricket, an abbreviated format that cut the game to about three to three and a half hours. The Hundred reduces that further, creating a television-ready product for Sky Sports and the BBC that spans two and a half hours.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: As explained in the story above, an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Tom Brady participated in the investment in The Hundred.",

That's where Adobe Express \u2014 an all-in-one editing tool, owned by Adobe, the very same company behind Photoshop \u2014 comes in. What makes Express stand out from its competition is its intuitive, easy-to-use interface and the fact that there is a free version available to use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, Adobe Express hopped onto the AI bandwagon, and introduced several AI-powered editing features, like Generative Fill and Text to Template, designed to make editing faster and easier for users, regardless of their skill level. One of these AI features allows you to remove an image's background in seconds.\n\nThe best part is that the \"Remove background\" feature is currently available for free to all users, regardless of whether you have a premium account or not.

The new AI model is available via the redesigned Firefly web app and is being positioned as the first \u201ccommercially safe AI video generation model\u201d.\n\nThe new Generative Video model allows users to generate both text-to-video and image-to-video content. The text-to-video feature allows users to generate a video using only a text description, while the image-to-video feature allows users to reference an image along with the text prompt to create customised footage.\n\n\"Generate Video (beta), powered by the Firefly Video Model, empowers creative professionals with tools to generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles to control shots, create professional-quality images from 3D sketches, craft atmospheric elements and develop custom motion design elements.\" Adobe explained in a release about the new feature.\n\nCurrently, the video generation model is capable of generating video up to 1080p for 5 seconds at 24 frames per second and takes about 90 seconds or more to create. Adobe says it is working on a lower-resolution model for high-speed iteration and a 4K model for production work.\n\nAdobe Firefly\n\nUnlike many other AI companies that have been sued for using copyrighted data, Adobe said it only trains Firefly on content it has permission to use, which includes Adobe Stock and public domain data. The company also noted that it does not use customer content to train its AI.\n\nAdobe says Firefly is integrated with other Adobe Creative Cloud applications, including Photoshop, Premier Pro and Adobe Express, to enhance the seamless editing process.\n\nThe San Jose, California-based company also announced two other features for its paid users. First, Scene to Image allows users to create \"professional-quality images\" from 3D sketches, which Adobe says can be used to seamlessly render production-ready assets from 3D shapes.\n\nSecondly, Translate Audio and Translate Video - as the name suggests - allow users to translate spoken dialogue into more than 20 languages. Adobe says its new tool allows creatives to quickly and easily translate video and audio, while matching the voice, tone, cadence and acoustics of the original content..\n\nAdobe Firefly subscription plan pricing: Adobe has also announced a new Standard and Pro plan. The Standard plan allows users up 2,000 video/audio credits per month and 20 vidoe generations of 5 second 1080p. It is priced at \u20b9797.68/month or 7,986.24 for an year, inclusive of GST.",

Women make up 60% of law students, compared to 51% in 2004.\n\nLGBTQ+ representation has also experienced strong growth, rising from 4% in 2009 to 17% today.\n\nDramatic debt increases\n\nIn 2004, only 18% of all LSSSE respondents expected to owe more than $100,000 in student loan debt. By 2009, that number had skyrocketed to 39% and has remained at similarly high levels.\n\nOnly 11% of law students graduated with no educational loans in 2004; by 2024, a full one-quarter (25%) of law students graduated debt-free.\n\nIn 2004, there were only marginal racial differences among students expecting to owe more than $100,000 upon graduation. By 2024, 51% of Black respondents and 53% of Latinx respondents expected to owe more than $100,000 in law school loans, compared to 32% of White and Asian American respondents.\n\nExpanded learning outcomes\n\nIn 2004, fewer than one-quarter (23%) of law students believed their schools did \u201cquite a bit\u201d or \u201cvery much\u201d to help them understand people of different racial backgrounds; 20 years later, almost half (47%) of students believe their schools help in this way, contributing to their ability to work proficiently with diverse populations.\n\nHigh levels of satisfaction\n\nOver the past two decades, students have consistently reported high levels of overall satisfaction with law school. While overall satisfaction rates look surprisingly constant over time, there are differences by race, gender and raceXgender.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2024, roughly 80% of all law students consistently rated their overall experience as good or excellent.\n\nWhite students report the highest levels of law school satisfaction (84% in 2024), while Black students remain among the least satisfied. Alarmingly, 28% of Black men and 33% of Black women rated their overall experience as fair or poor in 2024, highlighting persistent disparities in student experiences.\n\nWhile law students today maintain strong bonds with peers (76%) and with faculty (73%), positive relationships with administrative staff have dropped significantly, from 65% to 68% pre-pandemic to just 59% in 2024 \u2014 the lowest level recorded in two decades.\n\nConsistent job expectations\n\nBetween 2004 and 2024, roughly half (49%) of all LSSSE participants have expected to join private law firms upon graduation.\n\nExpectations for work in government have remained between 26% (2004) and 28% (2024).\n\nAs over the previous two decades, roughly 6% of students expect to work in public interest law.",

Adaptive Profiles and Distraction Removal are the standout features included in the update and are designed to help photographers elevate their editing game while keeping things simple and efficient.\n\nAdaptive Profiles is a new tool that helps photographers create stunning HDR images by dynamically adjusting tones and colors, resulting in realistic-looking photos. Unlike traditional presets, Adaptive Profiles uses an AI model to analyze images and correct tones and colors to make them look natural. Exposure, Shadows, Highlights, Color Mixer, and other global settings stay in their neutral position, giving you more flexibility to fine-tune the final look of an image.\n\nDistraction Removal is a tool that detects and removes common distractions in images like unwanted people in the background in just a few clicks. When distractions are identified, the tool masks them out and applies content-aware fill that seamlessly matches the rest of the image. Distraction Removal is currently in early access in Camera Raw and will be coming soon to Lightroom.\n\nAdobe Lightroom Workflow Enhancement Tools and Performance Updates\n\nIntroduced in the latest update, the Clean Up tool helps you organize your library by identifying and removing unneeded images. Find Duplicates is a part of the Clean Up tool which shifts through the thousands of images in your library and marks duplicates that you can delete later on. The tool can also identify blurry photos, screenshots, and other unwanted images that may find their way into your photo library. Clean Up is available for early access in the web version of Lightroom.\n\nThe update also adds the Intuitive Focus Point Selection tool which allows you to change the camera\u2019s focus point when tethered to Lightroom. While in Tether Live View, clicking on a subject automatically shifts focus to the desired area. This is very handy when the camera is mounted on a boom arm for those overhead shots. The feature is available for Lightroom Classic and supports Sony, Nikon, and Canon cameras.\n\nLightroom Mobile gets a bunch of updates including the ability to make selective edits on the background of your photos from your smartphone with a new AI masking tool. iOS users also get an enhanced sharing experience, making it easier to share albums and photos. Additionally, you can now get a real-time preview of any customizations to shared albums and content.\n\nLightroom Classic also receives performance improvements, making the editing experience more responsive when doing common tasks like brushing masks, rotating crop angles, and adjusting white balance. Accessing and reading folders in catalogs have also been optimized, significantly improving performance.\n\nWhere to Get Adobe Lightroom\n\nYou can download all the latest updates to Lightroom and Lightroom Classics from the Creative Cloud Desktop app, which is part of the Adobe app subscription.",

Today on KVPR's Central Valley Roots, the story of one such landmark along a highway in Kings County.\n\nOn the west side of Highway 41 just north of Lemoore sits El Adobe de Los Robles Rancho. It\u2019s a long rectangular ranch house, with a shake roof with white plaster covering most of its adobe brick walls.\n\nThis modest adobe structure might not look like much, but it is one of the most historic sites in the region. It was built in 1856 near the shoreline of Tulare Lake. It's the second oldest remaining building in the San Joaquin Valley. When it was built, the only European settlements in the area were Visalia and the former town of Kingston.\n\nThe house was built by early California settler Daniel Rhoads who came west in 1846, before the gold rush. Rhodes and his brother played another important part in California history. In 1847 they were part of the group that rescued the Donner Party.\n\nRhoads eventually became a cattle rancher, settling near the Kings River on what he called the ranch of the oaks. Today his original ranch house is a California state landmark. It\u2019s been continually occupied since 1856.",

            "content": "EXPANDING AI INITIATIVES ACROSS CAMPUSES\n\nBUILDING A WORKFORCE PIPELINE\n\nA MODEL FOR OTHER STATES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\nThe California State University System (CSU) is pouring millions of dollars into an AI education plan involving almost a dozen of the state\u2019s biggest names in technology. To better understand where that money is going and what is motivating those industry partners,gathered insights from NVIDIA, Intel and Adobe.To start, $16.9 million will go toward access to ChatGPT Edu, a new purpose-built version of Open AI\u2019s chatbot with data privacy guardrails, for faculty and students across the state\u2019s 23 campuses. But the initiative extends beyond chatbots, with major tech companies stepping in to provide faculty training and certifications, hands-on learning tools for students and ultimately create industry pipelines to make California a global competitor in an AI-driven workforce.A sampling of California State University campuses have already started working with tech companies to expand AI education programming, but the statewide initiative is focused on aligning priorities and ensuring all campuses have access to these resources.For example, five university campuses are currently Adobe Creative Campuses, or schools offering all students, faculty and staff access to Adobe Express, an AI-powered content creation platform. According to the company's Director of Education Learning and Advocacy Brian Johnsrud, that platform will now be available across the CSU system.\u201cWith Acrobat AI Assistant, they can boost their productivity in their research,\u201d Johnsrud wrote in an email to. \u201cAnd with Firefly generative AI models, students are better able to bring their creative visions to life, no matter how much creative training they have.\u201dLouis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives for the developer ecosystem at NVIDIA, touted the CSU partnership as an expansion of the company's work to date. In August 2024, NVIDIA partnered with the state to offer AI training and certification through its Deep Learning Institute University Ambassador Program . In December, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with San Jose State University and the city of San Jose, outlining goals to promote AI literacy and workforce development.\u201cIt really is just a continuation and allows us to work with everybody,\u201d Stewart said.For its part, CSU created an AI Commons Hub that offers AI tools, training and certification programs available for students across the university system.Darren Pulsipher, chief solution architect for the public sector at Intel, explained in an email tothat education will be key to filling jobs created by emerging AI technologies.\u201cA rapidly growing creator economy and breakthrough AI technologies have increased the demand for AI literacy and creative skills across all industries,\u201d Pulsipher wrote. \u201cIn California alone, the creator economy employs more than 800,000 people, or 4.6 percent of the state's workforce, and supports nearly 875,00 local service jobs.\u201dUltimately, these companies, along with government officials and educators, hope to equip students to meet the needs of California\u2019s industries. In NVIDIA\u2019s case, that will mean a focus on upskilling students, fostering talent retention and looking beyond their own internal needs.\u201cWe\u2019re actually really looking at the states, looking at the universities in those states, and the entire ecosystems,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBecause we're largely industry agnostic \u2014 we can help those ecosystems grow, whether it be startups, whether it be new developers, whether it be the states, and just trying to retain talent so they don\u2019t go other places.\u201dIntel\u2019s contributions to the CSU partnership will include training modules and tools like OpenVINO, an open source AI coding toolkit, for AI optimization and computing. Meanwhile, Adobe tools leverage AI in more creative spaces.\u201cAll of us bring different skills and talents to the table to help uplift the workforce in the state,\u201d Stewart said.According to a news release , students will also have opportunities to work with AI professionally through apprenticeship programs.With more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty members, CSU is touting its AI initiative as the first and largest of its kind.The news release said leaders from the companies and universities will work together on an AI Workforce Acceleration Board, whose first meeting will be held in March. Johnsrud said he hopes their discussions on what is working can be useful to anyone interested in replicating the program.\u201cOur priorities in these conversations include AI literacy, responsible AI development and bridging academia with industry needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe collaborate with other tech companies by sharing best practices, aligning skill requirements and co-investing in AI education initiatives.\u201d",

The tool is designed to integrate with Adobe\u2019s Premiere Pro software, making it useful for film and television professionals. Instead of focusing on generating long video clips, Adobe\u2019s model helps improve or extend real production shots that need adjustments.\n\nThe tool currently produces five-second clips at 1080p resolution, shorter than OpenAI\u2019s 20-second limit, but Adobe argues that most production clips are only a few seconds long. Pricing starts at $9.99 for 20 clips per month and $29.99 for 70 clips, with a separate \u2018Premium\u2019 plan for high-volume users like studios to be announced later this year. Adobe is also working on 4K video generation, prioritising visual quality over longer clips.\n\nVice President of Generative AI Alexandru Costin emphasised that Adobe aims to make AI-generated video look as realistic as traditional filming. The company remains focused on improving motion, structure, and image quality rather than extending clip duration. Meta Platforms is also developing a video-generation model, but has not yet confirmed a release date.\n\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

This week: Adobe\u2019s new Firefly AI video generator, and Netflix originals by the numbers.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Firefly video generator is a reality check for AI filmmaking\n\nAdobe officially released its answer to OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Google\u2019s Veo AI video generators this week: Firefly, which is now available in beta, allows filmmakers and other creatives to generate short video clips from simple text prompts or images. In addition to being available through a revamped Firefly web app, the video model has also been integrated into Adobe Premiere Pro. Firefly has been trained on both commercially licensed and public domain footage, with Adobe claiming that it is the \u201cfirst commercially safe AI video model.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of hype around AI video over the past few months, and it\u2019s easy to understand why: Some of the footage generated by Sora and Veo looks truly stunning, and Firefly does hold its own against the competition (check out Adobe\u2019s announcement blog post for a few very impressive clips). But there\u2019s also been a bit of a disconnect between those loud declarations that \u201cAI just killed Hollywood\u201d and the reality on the ground.\n\nI recently had a chance to talk to Adobe VP of Gen AI Alexandru Costin as well as the company\u2019s senior strategic development manager Morgan Prygrocki, who also gave me a demo of Firefly. This gave me a better understanding of what a video model like Firefly is capable of, and what its limitations to date are \u2013 and it reinforced what I\u2019ve come to believe for some time:\n\nAt least for now, AI is not a bomb that is going to blow up Hollywood. But it may just be the pyrotechnics that will help filmmakers get more bang for their buck, and in the end help dazzle us all with their craft.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe Internet of Things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are the key catalysts driving trends in the semiconductor market. Likewise, the market is expected to grow by $157.1 billion at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% by 2029, as per estimates by Technavio. The growth would be fueled by the growing need for chips to power the telecom sector, automotive, consumer electronics, IT and communications, healthcare, aerospace and defence, and consumer goods.\n\nSimilarly, the growing demand for semiconductors brought on by emerging technologies like 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT) presents serious challenges for the semiconductor industry. Two to four million gallons of ultra-pure water are needed every day at a single semiconductor fabrication plant, which uses about one Terawatt-hour (TWh) of energy annually.\n\nAdditionally, tussles between nations could pose significant challenges to the semiconductor sector, consequently hindering the development of artificial intelligence innovations. Countries passing protectionist measures to curb access to advanced semiconductors are seen as one hindrance to the robust growth projected.\n\nIn addition to its potential to improve access to food, healthcare, and education, artificial intelligence (AI) can also aid in developing biological and other weapons, support cyber attacks, aid in surveillance, and contribute to other human rights violations.\n\n\"The potential military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled applications of these technologies and products pose risks to U.S. national security particularly when developed by a country of concern such as the PRC,\" the Treasury Department notification said.\n\nThe US has already passed restrictions on Chinese firm's access to advanced semiconductors and equipment developed by US companies. The restrictions come amid concerns that China's gaining access to advanced semiconductors could pose significant security risks in the future.\n\nChina has also hit back with similar measures. China has blasted the United States for imposing new export restrictions on semiconductors made in the United States, which Washington believes Beijing may use to create the next generation of weapons and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\n\"The U.S. has to be prepared for rapid increases in AI's capability in the coming years, which could have a transformative impact on the economy and on our national security,\" U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.\n\nStory Continues",

Learn More.\n\nAdobe has officially entered the AI video generation race with the launch of its Firefly Video Model in a public beta. This move marks a significant step in Adobe\u2019s expansion of AI-powered creative tools specifically designed for professional filmmakers and video editors.\n\nUnlike OpenAI\u2019s Sora, which generates entirely AI-driven video clips, Adobe has tailored the Firefly Video Model for professional filmmakers and video editors, particularly those using its Premiere Pro software. Instead of only generating random AI footage, Firefly is designed to enhance or fix existing scenes. It offers features like generating clips to fill gaps in scenes or adding atmospheric effects like snow or fog, making it a practical tool for film and TV studios.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s Sora can generate videos up to 20 seconds long, Adobe\u2019s Firefly currently produces five-second clips at 1080p resolution.\n\nIP safety and professional use\n\nAdobe\u2019s strong stance on intellectual property is a major differentiator. The Firefly Video Model is trained on licensed and public domain content, ensuring users can confidently use the generated videos in commercial projects without risking copyright infringement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the most useful solution because we\u2019re IP-friendly and commercially safe,\u201d said Costin. \u201cYou can use our model without worrying about legal risks.\u201d\n\nTo reinforce content authenticity, Adobe embeds Content Credentials into all AI-generated videos. This digital certification aligns with the company\u2019s leadership in the Content Authenticity Initiative, which promotes transparency and verification for digital media.\n\nThe tool also seamlessly integrates with Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud suite, including Premiere Pro and Photoshop. It allows users to generate AI clips and then fine-tune them using Adobe\u2019s professional editing tools, such as color matching and atmospheric effects.\n\nAdobe Firefly Video Model pricing and accessibility\n\nAdobe has introduced a tiered pricing model for Firefly Video Model to cater to different user needs:\n\nStandard Plan: $9.99/month \u2013 20 video clips\n\n$9.99/month \u2013 20 video clips Pro Plan: $29.99/month \u2013 70 video clips\n\nIn contrast, OpenAI offers 50 videos for $20 per month but at a lower resolution. A premium pricing plan for studios and high-volume users is also under development, with details expected later this year.\n\nAdobe is also rolling out additional AI tools, including Scene to Image, which lets users create 3D references for AI-generated images, and an Audio and Video Translation tool for dubbing content into over 20 languages. These features and the Firefly Video Model are part of Adobe\u2019s broader strategy to dominate the professional AI creative space.\n\nRising competition in AI Video\n\nDespite its fresh entry, Adobe faces stiff competition from AI video models like Sora from OpenAI and the upcoming second generation of Google\u2019s Veo AI model, both of which have gained attention for their advanced features. Startups like Runway and Pika Labs also push the boundaries of what AI can do in video creation.\n\nAdobe\u2019s strategy focuses on quality over clip length, emphasizing professional-grade results that smoothly integrate into existing workflows. \u201cWe think great motion, structure, and definition are more important than longer clips that might be unusable,\u201d Costin explained.\n\nWith Firefly Video Model, Adobe signals that AI-generated video is not just for experimentation; it\u2019s a professional-grade tool ready for real-world production.",

            "content": "Yesterday, Adobe released the beta version of its much-anticipated Firefly Video Model. The text-to-video and image-to-video generator offers the ability to produce 16\u00d79 and 9\u00d716 video clips up to five seconds in length at 1080p resolution, with the promise that 4K is coming soon.\n\nFirefly is the brand name for Adobe\u2018s family of generative AI applications, first made publicly available in March 2023 with its still image generator. Today that\u2019s part of its Creative Cloud applications suite and, according to the company, has produced over 18 billion assets. Developing Firefly Video took longer than the company expected. Its first significant steps forward came last fall with the introduction of Gen AI tools like Object Removal and Generative Extend to Premiere Pro. Adobe\u2019s professional video editing software is widely used by independent filmmakers, including a majority of those at Sundance this year.\n\nFirefly is not the first publicly available text-to-video generator and \u2014 we\u2019ll wait for reviews, once users have time to fully test drive \u2014 it may not be the most powerful. The big selling point for Firefly Video is, unlike OpenAI\u2019s Sora, it is commercially safe.\n\nFrom day one, a \u201cclean\u201d model was the company\u2019s AI selling point: Adobe doesn\u2019t infringe on copyrighted material. Unlike so many Gen AI models that steal (and can we please start using this word) whatever it can scrape off the internet, Adobe trained Firefly using images and video it owns \u2014 in part by leveraging its stock photo and video business and relationships.\n\nIn conversations with IndieWire over the last year, Adobe executives told IndieWire that the \u201cclean\u201d approach slowed their Firefly video progress. It also means that its Gen AI generator may have initial gaps in its abilities. But for those who care about AI ethics (or, are simply paid professionals who can\u2019t work commercially and violate copyright laws), Adobe\u2019s approach is refreshing in the face of Silicon Valley thieves who believe that breakneck AI development will outpace the courts\u2019 ability to legislate it.\n\nFilmmakers working in Premiere Pro must exit that application and open the Firefly to generate video. However, once the video is in Premiere they can make key adjustments to the Firefly footage, rather than having to toggle between apps.\n\nThe beta version of Firefly Video also offers basic filmmaking and camera controls. It understands a \u201cclose-up,\u201d and \u201cwide shot,\u201d and it can execute basic camera moves. This is a particularly powerful feature with the photo-to-video generator. In a demonstration for IndieWire, the controls work well; it also lets you avoid some of the madness involved with trying to get ChatGPT to write a paragraph that will allow Sora to understand a long shot.\n\nAs seems to be true with all things AI, the audio features are impressive today. The ability to generate narration or dubs in other languages is potentially huge for independent creators who want to reach a global audience.\n\nAvailable today are two new Adobe Firefly plan offerings, Firefly Standard ($9.99) and Firefly Pro ($29.99). Firefly Standard provides 2,000 video/audio credits per month with up to 20 five-second 1080p video generations. Firefly Pro provides 7,000 video/audio credits per month with up to 70 five-second 1080p video generations. Coming soon: a Firefly Premium plan for high-volume professionals.",

            "content": "Since its premiere at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, \u201cThe Substance\u201d has captivated audiences with its highly entertaining and satirical perspective, innovative filmmaking and career-defining performance from Demi Moore. Directed, written, produced and edited by Coralie Fargeat, the film follows Elisabeth Sparkle (Moore), a former A-lister past her prime and drawn to the opportunity presented by a mysterious new drug that transforms her \u2014 temporarily \u2014 into the gorgeous, twenty-something Sue (Margaret Qualley).\n\nThis \u201cbe-careful-what-you-wish-for\u201d fable for the ages is currently nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. We sat down with Fargeat\u2019s long-time collaborator and co-editor, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet, to get an inside look at the experimental post-production process, learn more about his own creative inspirations and explore how they used Premiere Pro to execute this ambitious project.\n\nBecause this film has very little dialogue, Fargeat and Eltabet worked tirelessly through the 300+ hours of footage and 230 sequences to build its dynamic rhythm through sound. \u201cPremiere Pro\u2019s flexibility and powerful features make it ideal for shaping the sound design. It allowed us to create the precise atmosphere we envisioned for each scene,\u201d said Eltabet.\n\nRead on to learn more about the making of \u201cThe Substance.\u201d\n\nHow and where did you first learn to edit?\n\nI first learned to edit at a post-production company called UMT in Paris. As a technical assistant, I took every opportunity to practice. Whenever an edit room was available, I would go in and teach myself.\n\nHow did you get involved with this project?\n\nI have been working with Coralie Fargeat for about twenty years \u2014 and this is our second feature film together (our first was Revenge in 2017). We have a unique way of working \u2014 it's a four-handed editing process where we share and exchange sequences throughout the process. We have also collaborated on TV and commercial projects.\n\nImage Source: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nI keep my approach fairly simple. I like to have each shot of a sequence on the same timeline and drag the circled takes to V2. Then \u2014 I go through all the footage, isolate my favorite moments, and add locators to note my initial impressions while reviewing the rushes.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes from this project is when Elisabeth is putting on makeup in front of the mirror before going on a date. At first, we needed to feel her joy and excitement, but gradually, it had to become clear that she wouldn\u2019t be able to go \u2014 overcome by the realization that she cannot face Sue\u2019s perfect beauty. The rhythm of this sequence had to be absolutely precise, as it serves as the emotional core of the film.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nThe biggest challenge was managing the enormous amount of footage \u2014 over 300 hours in total. With around 230 sequences to edit and very little dialogue, the process became quite complex. It wasn\u2019t just about cutting the footage \u2014 it was also about creating a dynamic rhythm through sound. Since there was minimal dialogue, it was crucial to design the sound from scratch, building a soundscape that would match the tone of each scene. I also had to find temporary music for every sequence, making sure it captured the right emotion and energy to guide the editing process. This required a lot of trial and error, but it was key to shaping the film\u2019s overall mood and pace.\n\nWhat Adobe tools did you use on this project and why did you originally choose them?\n\nWe primarily used Premiere Pro, which we chose for its intuitive and modern interface. Coralie and I work a lot on sound editing \u2014 and Premiere Pro is the perfect tool for this. Its flexibility and powerful features make it ideal for shaping the sound design. It allowed us to create the precise atmosphere we envisioned for each scene.\n\nImage Source: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nI use keyboard shortcuts to adjust the audio levels of a clip, either increasing or decreasing the volume, and I also learned how to nest one sequence into another. Very useful!\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nFor me, creative inspiration comes from many different sources. In terms of filmmakers, I have always been inspired by the work of directors like Darren Aronofsky or David Fincher for his meticulous attention to detail, and the way he builds tension through both visual and auditory elements (he also liked to work on Premiere Pro). I also admire the editing style of Thelma Schoonmaker, whose work with Martin Scorecese has taught me the importance of rhythm and pacing in storytelling.\n\nWhat\u2019s the toughest thing you\u2019ve had to face in your career and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nThe most challenging task of my career was editing \u201cThe Substance\u201d. It was a long and meticulous process. With Coralie, we worked in a very artisanal and experimental way, with a lot of research to find the film's unique universe. She wanted her film to feel like a sensory and emotional trip. My advice, as Coralie successfully did, is to avoid sanitizing your film and to believe in your project all the way through. Stay true to your vision, no matter the challenges.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nImage Source: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Eltabet.\n\nI love working from home. I\u2019m well-equipped, which allows me to organize my work efficiently. Plus, I can easily take care of any urgent matters for my children if needed, which makes it easier to balance my professional and personal life.",

You can choose from either vertical or horizontal aspect ratios. To better guide video generations, you have the ability to add keyframes at the start and end or generate an image in Text to Image to then easily open in Generate Video as the starting keyframe. You can also leverage Firefly-powered features in Adobe Creative Cloud, such as Generative Fill in Photoshop and Generative Remove in Lightroom , to edit photos making it easier to bring them to life with the video model.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited by the AI products that Adobe is developing for filmmakers. As an editor, it\u2019s my job to stay on top of new technologies that expedite the creative process and get us closer to seeing what\u2019s in the mind of the filmmaker on screen. My philosophy with editing is to get the offline edit to 85 percent of the way there with color, sound, and vfx so my clients can watch an edit and focus on the story and not be distracted by roughness. Sometimes that means futzing with sound or dabbling with color or maybe trying my hand at some temp VFX. Premiere Pro features like Enhance Speech, Media Intelligence, and now Generative Extend help me get the edit there faster \u2014 so we have more time to dig into the edit and creative with my collaborators down the pipeline. These tools will help remove some of the tedium of the process allowing us to focus on what\u2019s ultimately going to affect the audience most.\u201d\n\n\n\n-Ernie Gilbert, Filmmaker (editor, A24\u2019s Opus)\n\nSeamlessly convert images into high-quality video clips and generate b-roll to fill gaps in your timeline with Image to Video, ensuring a smooth and professional workflow.\n\nDevelop compelling storyboards and pitch concepts with ease, using Generate Video in the Edit menu of Text to Image to seamlessly visualize and refine your creative ideas.\n\nGuide your video creation process by setting precise starting and ending keyframes, ensuring consistent and visually cohesive results.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more creative control in image generation.\n\nFirefly gives you the ability to fine-tune the details to create images that match your imagination, adjust composition, use photorealistic styles, change the mood and lighting, and produce high-quality images with the most advanced creative controls yet.\n\nThe Text to Image interface in Firefly has been redesigned to streamline the creative process.

            "content": "\n\nOriginally posted on 11 September 2024, and updated with details of the public beta.\n\nAdobe has rolled out the Firefly Video Model, a new AI model that will bring generative AI to the company\u2019s video production tools like Premiere Pro, and potentially After Effects.\n\nIts capabilities include generating additional audio or video frames from an existing video clip, and generating new video clips from reference images or text prompts.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve compiled our FAQs on the Firefly Video Model, which is now available in public beta on the Firefly web app, and in beta builds of Premiere Pro.\n\nWhat can Firefly\u2019s generative AI models currently do?\n\nReleased last year, Firefly is a suite of generative AI art tools available both as a web application and integrated into Adobe Creative Cloud tools.\n\nThe underlying AI models were initially geared towards generating still images, and are now integrated into applications including Photoshop and the Substance 3D tools.\n\nWhat are the key features of the Firefly Video Model?\n\nThe new Firefly Video Model extends those capabilities to moving images, synthesising new video footage from a range of sources in a similar way to platforms like Runway.\n\nAccording to Adobe, its capabilities include Generative Extend, which extends existing video clips, generating new frames at the start or end, or generating extra audio \u2018room tone\u2019.\n\nImage to Video generates clips based on reference stills, or even concept illustrations.\n\nText to Video generates video from text prompts, with the additional option to specify camera properties like camera position, zoom extent and common camera motion types.\n\nWhat kinds of video and animation can the Firefly Video Model generate?\n\nAlthough the Firefly Video Model can generate 2D and 3D animation \u2013 Adobe\u2019s initial blog post showed examples of generated footage resembling 3D, hand-drawn and stop-motion animation \u2013 its main initial use case is more naturalistic video.\n\nAccording to Adobe, it \u201cexcels at generating videos of the natural world \u2026 like landscapes, plants or animals\u201d.\n\nHowever, the firm also cites a range of other possible uses, including creating FX elements like fire, smoke and dust that could be composited into VFX or motion graphics projects.\n\nHow good is the Firefly Video Model?\n\nAlthough the Firefly Video Model could potentially generate entire video sequences, current generative video tools struggle to maintain temporal and stylistic consistency in their output.\n\nAdobe\u2019s blog post suggests that its initial use will be to generate supplementary material for projects shot conventionally \u2013 essentially, generating AI stock footage \u2013 citing use cases like generating B-roll and missing establishing shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat user controls does the Firefly Video Model provide?\n\nAs well as the source image and/or text prompt \u2013 it supports up to 1,000 characters of text \u2013 the implementation of the Video Model in the Firefly web app includes built-in controls.\n\nUsers can select the aspect ratio of the video generated (currently only 16:9 or 9:16), and choose from a range of presets for shot size (ranging from extreme close up to extreme long shots), camera angle (including aerial shots), and camera moves (including handheld shots).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the Firefly Video Model?\n\nIn the initial public beta, generated clips are limited to 5 seconds in length and 1080p resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Firefly Video Model\u2019s Generative Extend feature in use in a Premiere Pro project.\n\n\n\nWhich Adobe applications will the Firefly Video Model be integrated in?\n\nAlthough the Firefly tools are available online, Adobe is also increasingly integrating them into its Creative Cloud apps.\n\nSo far, the only one in which the Firefly Video Model will definitely be included is video editing software Premiere Pro, beta builds of which now include Generative Extend.\n\nHowever, Adobe\u2019s initial blog post also namechecked compositing app After Effects. The firm has previously shown tech previews of generative AI tools suitable for After Effects.\n\nWhat data is the Firefly Video AI model trained on?\n\nAdobe describes the Firefly Video AI model as \u201ccommercially safe and is only trained on content we have permission to use\u201d.\n\nEarlier in 2024, the firm updated its Terms of Use to explicitly rule out the use of users\u2019 content \u2013 aside from that uploaded to stock content marketplace Adobe Stock \u2013 to train AI models, following a widely publicised artist backlash.\n\nHow much does it cost to use the Firefly Video AI model?\n\nAs with many of the other Firefly services, pricing for the Firefly Video Model is credit-based.\n\nAdobe has introduced new pricing to coincide with the public beta. Generating video initially uses 20 credits per second of footage, set to rise to 100 credits per second.\n\nThe new $9.99/month Firefly Standard plans provide 2,000 video credits per month; $29.99/month Firefly Pro plans provide 7,000 credits per month.\n\nCredits are also included as part of Creative Cloud subscriptions.\n\nWhen will the Firefly Video Model become available?\n\nThe Firefly Video Model is now available via the Firefly web app. Text to Video and Image to Video are both in beta.\n\nRead more about the Firefly Video model on Adobe\u2019s blog\n\nVisit Adobe\u2019s Firefly web app\n\n(Includes Text to Video and Image to Video)\n\n\n\nHave your say on this story by following CG Channel on Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).

The company is positioning this as a competitive advantage over rivals like OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Runway\u2019s Gen-3 Alpha, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Veo.\n\n\u201cFirefly is designed for creative professionals looking for unmatched creative control and IP-friendly tools that can be used safely and effectively in both ideation and production,\u201d said David Wadhwani, president of Adobe\u2019s digital media business. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thrilled to hear from beta customers who\u2019ve found it a game-changer for ideating concepts and producing stunning videos, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the creative community uses it to bring their stories to the world.\u201d\n\nINSIDER TAKE: Monetizing AI in the Creative Economy\n\nAdobe\u2019s subscription-first approach to generative AI marks a shift in the monetization of creative tools. While Firefly\u2019s AI-powered image generation was initially bundled within Creative Cloud, Adobe is now testing direct AI subscription revenue with Firefly Video.\n\nFor subscription businesses, this move offers two takeaways:\n\nAI as a Premium Subscription Add-On \u2013 By launching Firefly Standard and Pro separately, Adobe is testing how much creators are willing to pay for AI-generated content. This could set a precedent for SaaS companies looking to layer AI functionality into existing subscription tiers. The IP-Friendly Differentiator \u2013 Adobe\u2019s emphasis on commercial safety aligns with the growing concern over AI-generated content\u2019s legal implications. While OpenAI and others face scrutiny over training data, Adobe is actively marketing Firefly as a \u201csafe-for-commercial-use\u201d AI model.\n\nAs AI-generated content becomes more mainstream, Adobe\u2019s AI subscription strategy will be a key case study for subscription businesses evaluating how to integrate AI-driven innovation into their own models.",

This includes the new Firefly AI video model, which is rolling out in public beta on the Firefly website and in the Premiere Pro Beta app.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Firefly AI model made This. Looks like a deformed whale in the back? Image Credits:Adobe\n\nFirefly\u2019s Standard plan costs $9.99 per month and provides unlimited access to Adobe\u2019s AI image and vector generating features, as well as Adobe\u2019s new AI video model. The Standard plan gives users 2,000 credits, which is enough to make 20 five-second AI videos.\n\nUsers can also connect Firefly plans to their Creative Cloud accounts to get unlimited AI image and vector generation in Photoshop, Express, or other Adobe apps.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pro plan will run users $29.99 a month, and offers enough credits to generate 70 five-second AI videos per month. The company is also working on a \u201cPremium\u201d tier (it hasn\u2019t announced pricing for this yet) that lets users create 500 AI videos per month, according to Adobe\u2019s VP of Generative AI, Alexandru Costin.\n\nAdobe wants creators to generate visual effects with Firefly. Image Credits:Adobe\n\nPreviously, Adobe offered many of Firefly\u2019s AI tools within its existing Creative Cloud subscriptions, letting users try the new tools for no added cost. Users could upgrade to pricier plans if they wanted more access to Firefly, but they didn\u2019t have to. That system worked well for Adobe: Firefly\u2019s generative fill feature, added to Photoshop in 2023, has become one of the company\u2019s most popular new features of the last decade.\n\nNow, Adobe wants to see if users will also pay up for its Firefly AI models.\n\nThe Firefly video model lets you turn text or images into a five-second, AI-generated video. There are controls on a side panel for changing the camera angles, camera movement, aspect ratio, and other features that creative professionals might want to customize.\n\nThe new Firefly offerings will compete directly with OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Runway\u2019s Gen-3 Alpha, and other AI video models that already have dedicated web pages and subscription plans. Google DeepMind\u2019s AI video model, Veo, seems to be a legitimate contender in the space as well, but it\u2019s still in private beta.\n\nPart of Adobe\u2019s pitch to creative professionals is that Firefly was trained on a dataset of licensed videos, without any brand logos or NSFW content (something the company paid quite a bit to do). That means, according to Adobe, creatives should be able to use the Firefly AI models without worrying about legal troubles.\n\nHere\u2019s what prompting FIrefly\u2019s AI model looks like. Image Credits:Adobe\n\n\u201cWe think the key differentiator for us is that we\u2019re the only IP-friendly, commercially-safe video model,\u201d Costin said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cWe want to differentiate with deep understanding of customer problems.\u201d\n\nAdobe has also tried to ship AI tools that solve problems for creative professionals instead of just generating random AI videos.\n\nFor example, one of Firefly\u2019s AI video features, Generative Extend, lets users extend any clip\u2019s video and background noise by a few seconds. This is one of the more practical AI video tools on the market; other AI models just let you create new videos from scratch, or animate photos.\n\nCostin says Adobe is working on another AI video tool to help with pre-production. The tool, which has yet to be announced, would help get creatives aligned on the same vision by creating a rough sketch of what a scene, or string of scenes, would look like.\n\nHowever, Adobe needs to walk a fine line with generative AI. Many professionals who have used Adobe\u2019s apps for decades are upset about the rise of generative AI tools in their industries. The technology poses a threat to their livelihoods as they risk having their work automated away to an AI model \u2014 like the ones Adobe is building.\n\nBut Adobe is convinced this is where the puck is going in the creative world.",

Adobe says it\u2019s also working on both a faster, lower-resolution \u201cideation model\u201d and a 4K model, which are \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nAdobe has also updated the Firefly web app that hosts many of its generative AI tools. Alongside sporting a new UI, it now integrates with Creative Cloud apps including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Express, making it easier to move and edit AI-generated assets. And because Firefly is trained on public domain and licensed content, it\u2019s safe for commercial use. Adobe even describes its Generate Video tool as \u201cproduction-ready\u201d to entice users who want to use AI-generated videos in films without the risk of violating copyright protections.\n\nAdobe faces growing competition in the AI video market. In addition to Sora, Google is testing the second generation of its Veo AI video model, which looks more impressive than OpenAI\u2019s model judging by early demo examples. ByteDance and Pika Labs have also recently announced new video-focused generative AI tools. Adobe\u2019s main advantage is Firefly\u2019s commercial viability, but it will still need to keep up with the quality and features its competitors are offering.\n\nTwo additional tools will also be available in public beta on the Firefly web app starting today \u2014 but these aren\u2019t free to use. Scene to Image lets users create their own references for AI-generated images using built-in 3D and sketching features \u2014 seemingly built on the \u201cProject Scenic\u201d experiment that Adobe announced in October. The Translate Audio and Video tool is pretty self-explanatory, allowing users to translate and dub audio into over 20 languages while preserving the original speaker\u2019s voice.\n\nAdobe is launching two new Firefly subscription plans which provide credits that can be spent to use Adobe\u2019s Firefly models. Firefly Standard starts at $9.99 per month for 2,000 video/audio credits and provides up to 20 five-second 1080p video generations. The pricier Firefly Pro plan starts at $29.99 for 7,000 credits and up to 70 five-second 1080p video generations. A notable perk is that both plans include unlimited access to Firefly imaging and vector features.",

The company's earnings report is set to go public on March 12, 2025. On that day, Adobe Systems is projected to report earnings of $4.97 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 10.94%.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

(Image credit: Rebecca Spear / Windows Central)\n\nIf you're interested in learning how to use Adobe Creative Cloud apps, I highly recommend going for this discount. I can personally say that knowing how to use many of these programs can give you an edge in various career fields, whether or not they are creative-focused. Adobe subscriptions are usually pretty expensive, so getting a year's subscription for 70% off is a real boon when you're a poor, starving college student. Believe me. I know.\n\nWhen I was in college, a similar student and teacher Adobe discount was going on, and I decided to go for it. I'm so happy I did. Seriously, I could not have foreseen how knowing Photoshop, Illustrator, and more would help me stand out in my career, but it really has. Between photo editing, video editing, and digital drawing, I tend to work in Creative Cloud programs every week, if not every day. I've been a professional writer for years now, but I'm often one of the only people I work with who knows how to use Adobe's flagship software.\n\nSince graduating college, I've been able to use Creative Cloud apps to create mockups, visuals, videos, and final projects that frequently get used at just about every job I've had. More than once during interviews, my Photoshop skills have been one of the first things potential employers bring up when looking at my resume.\n\nThat's not to say that you'll automatically know how to use these programs once you have access to them, but having that access at a much lower price than usual brings you one step closer to mastering them. As for myself, I ended up taking a couple of classes in college and have since learned how to use Creative Cloud programs more thoroughly by looking up various video and written tutorials online. If you have the drive, you can learn these programs and give yourself an edge in just about whatever career you choose.",

Adobe\u2019s stock has plummeted 28.1% over the past 52 weeks and gained a modest 1.4% on a YTD basis, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 20.7% surge over the past year and 3.1% gains on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, Adobe has also lagged behind the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF\u2019s (IGV) 20.4% gains over the past year and a 6.3% surge in 2025.\n\nDespite crushing analysts\u2019 estimates, Adobe\u2019s stock plunged 13.7% in the trading session after the release of its Q4 results on Dec. 11. Driven by strong demand for its subscription-based software and services, Adobe\u2019s total revenues for the quarter surged 11.1% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, exceeding the Street\u2019s expectations by 1.2%. Meanwhile, driven by disciplined expense management, Adobe\u2019s net income increased by a robust 13.5% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, its non-GAAP EPS of $4.81 also surpassed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by a notable margin.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Q1 2025 revenue guidance range of $5.63 billion to $5.68 billion fell short of the Street\u2019s expectations of $5.73 billion by a notable margin, unsettling investor confidence.\n\nFor the current fiscal 2025, ending in November, analysts expect Adobe to report a solid 11.7% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP earnings to $16.65 per share. However, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters while missing on one other occasion.\n\nAmong the 33 analysts covering the ADBE stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 21 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d nine \u201cHold,\u201d one \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than a month ago when two analysts gave \u201cStrong Sell\u201d recommendations.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Wells Fargo (WFC) analyst Michael Turrin reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on ADBE, while setting a price target of $640.\n\nADBE\u2019s mean price target of $575.42 represents a 27.6% premium to current price levels, while its street-high target of $703 indicates a staggering 55.8% upside potential.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

On his DNG file was a bizarre orb, the question had to be asked: had he just captured the best photo of a UFO ever?\n\nSadly for Geraci and everyone here at PetaPixel, the answer was more prosaic: an AI hallucination had somehow worked its way into the photographer\u2019s RAW file.\n\nBizarre Artifact\n\nWhen the rest of the United States were watching the Super Bowl on Sunday evening, Geraci headed out to capture photos of the bright, full Moon.\n\n\u201cFlash forward to the next morning, I started to edit a few of the photos,\u201d Geraci, a Sony Artisan of Imagery, tells PetaPixel. \u201cMy normal workflow is to process my RAW files inside of Adobe Lightroom Classic and export from there.\u201d\n\nAfter he was happy with the edit, Geraci synced the settings across all the other pictures so he didn\u2019t have to reprocess every image. However, there were a few small sensor spots that he used Lightroom\u2019s Generative AI-powered \u201cRemove\u201d tool to eliminate.\n\nGeraci chose one of the RAW files to crop vertically, deeming it a more interesting composition. He then deployed the \u201cDenoise\u201d tool on Adobe Lightroom, which removes digital noise \u2014 usually without issue \u2014 and generates a new DNG file.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the image is still cropped,\u201d he says. \u201cI decided that I wanted to go back and re-compose the shot for Instagram, so I had to un-crop it. That\u2019s when I noticed this orb-shaped object in the frame. It was incredibly weird, and I definitely didn\u2019t see it when I first started processing the imagery.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first thought when I saw this, because it was simply just strange, was like, \u2018What the #$@% did I capture?\u2019 I went back through the RAW photos on my camera but couldn\u2019t see anything. I then decided to post the image on Facebook to see if anyone else had any ideas, and of course the number one answer was \u2018It\u2019s a UFO!!!\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s the Death Star!'\u201d\n\nGeraci insists that, as much as he would love it to be, he never truly considered that he\u2019d captured a UFO. Yet, he couldn\u2019t immediately explain what the weird orb was.\n\n\u201cAfter discussing it with other photographers (and even a few astronomers), I realized it had to be something in the processing of the imagery,\u201d he says. Geraci went back and retraced his steps, undoing all of his edits and walking the image backward until he found the culprit.\n\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that because I used the \u2018Remove\u2019 tool, which has AI generative capabilities, and then used the denoise tool\u2026 My only choice was to accept that the image created an artifact from the removed area which turned into the \u2018UFO,'\u201d he explains.\n\nOther photographers have had similar experiences using Generative Remove in recent versions of Adobe software, including a photographer earlier this year who had generative remove put a bitcoin in his bird photo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally never had this happen on any other imagery that I\u2019ve used, and even after trying to replicate it (and not having success), that\u2019s the only logical answer as to what it could be.\u201d\n\nGeraci says it \u201cwould have been really neat to have taken the best or sharpest UFO image in history\u201d but says it\u2019s still taught him a valuable lesson: from now on he will be careful using generative AI-powered editing tools.\n\n\u201cI would prefer if Adobe would leave UFOs out of my work moving forward,\u201d he jokes.\n\nMore of Geraci\u2019s work can be found on his Facebook and website.\n\nImage credits: Photographs by Drew Geraci",

It allows you to adjust the duration, but it doesn\u2019t allow you to save it.\n\nIf you want to save a transition with its duration or any other customizations, go into the effect controls (Shift+5), and right click on the FX badge.\n\nThis will give you a pop-up to save the preset, and yes, you want to save it with transition duration.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s no way to apply these to multiple transitions. But here\u2019s where you can always submit a request for it!\n\nThis series is courtesy of Adobe.",

They need AI literacy and creative skills to navigate and succeed in an AI-powered future. University systems everywhere are building new programs to equip their students for this future, and the California State University (CSU) is leading the way with a groundbreaking new initiative to empower students with the skills most in demand by employers.\n\nCSU, the nation\u2019s largest public, four-year university system, recently announced the establishment of an AI Workforce Acceleration Board, a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership. Adobe has joined the AI Workforce Acceleration Board as a founding member, building upon our long-standing partnership with CSU to help ensure that graduates across all disciplines \u2014 business, healthcare, engineering, education, or the arts \u2014 enter the workforce AI-skilled and career-ready.\n\nBridging the skills gap for the next generation of workers\n\nA rapidly growing creator economy and breakthrough AI technologies have increased the demand for AI literacy and creative skills across all industries. In California alone, the creator economy employs over 800,000 people \u2014 nearly 5 percent of the state\u2019s workforce \u2014 and supports 875,000 local service jobs, according to Otis College.\n\nYet, there\u2019s a skills gap. According to a recent Graduate Employability Report, nearly two in three (62 percent) employers believe candidates should have foundational knowledge of GenAI tools, but 55 percent of graduates said their campuses did not prepare them to use GenAI tools.\n\nHow Adobe is helping CSU students gain a competitive edge\n\nCSU\u2019s new initiative will equip students across all majors to learn how to use AI and to build their digital creative skills. The program builds on Adobe\u2019s long-standing partnership with the CSU system. More than 300 Student Ambassadors from CSU have hosted workshops, participated in events, and engaged in professional development activities with Adobe to bolster their career readiness.\n\nFive CSU universities \u2014 Fullerton, San Jose State, Fresno State, San Diego State, and Stanislaus \u2014 have also become Adobe Creative Campuses. At an Adobe Creative Campus, all students, faculty, and staff have access to Adobe Creative Cloud apps, including Adobe Express. That access to creative tools with innovative AI capabilities encourages students in all fields to strengthen their digital literacy, embrace their creativity, and take charge of their learning.\n\nThrough this new initiative, Adobe will help CSU faculty and students:\n\nGain hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools. Students can use Adobe Express, including its built-in AI tools, to create presentations, build resumes, or refine portfolios. With Acrobat AI Assistant, they can boost their productivity in their research. And with Firefly generative AI models, students are better able to bring their creative visions to life, no matter how much creative training they have.\n\nStudents can use Adobe Express, including its built-in AI tools, to create presentations, build resumes, or refine portfolios.

We look forward to working closely with the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies to develop amezalpat with the goal of bringing this promising therapy to patients.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing MORPHEUS-LIVER trial is evaluating immunotherapy-based combinations in patients with advanced liver cancer.4 The open-label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study is enrolling patients at least 18 years of age with histologically, cytologically, or clinically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC that is not amenable to curative surgical and/or locoregional therapies and not previously treated with systemic therapy. Other key inclusion criteria consist of an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; liver diseases criteria in patients with cirrhosis; a Child-Pugh class A score; and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and adequate hematologic and end-organ function are both required in stages 1 and 2 of the trial.\n\nKey exclusion criteria for stage 1 of the trial include prior treatment with anti-CD137 agonists, immune checkpoint blockade therapies, or HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitors; treatment with investigational therapy within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment; treatment with locoregional therapy to the liver within 28 days of enrollment; untreated or incompletely treated esophageal and/or gastric varices with bleeding or at high risk for bleeding; and prior bleeding due to esophageal and/or gastric varices within 6 months of study enrollment.\n\nPatients are being excluded from both stages of the study if they have fibrolamellar HCC, sarcomatoid HCC, or mixed cholangiocarcinoma and HCC; a history of hepatic encephalopathy; symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing central nervous system metastases; or a history of leptomeningeal disease.\n\nDuring stage 1, several novel agents are being evaluated with the atezolizumab-plus-bevacizumab backbone, including tiragolumab (MTIG7192A), tocilizumab (Actema), amezalpat, ADG126, and NKT2152. Tobemstomig is also being evaluated in combination with bevacizumab.\n\nIn the amezalpat arm, patients received 1200 mg of amezalpat per day on days 1 to 21 in combination with 1200 mg of atezolizumab on day 1 and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In the control arm, patients received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab alone following the same dosing schedule. Treatment continued in both arms until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit. Patients who discontinue treatment during stage 1 may be eligible to receive a different combination in stage 2.\n\nORR is serving as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points include progression-free survival, OS, duration of response, disease control rate, and safety.\n\nReferences",

A topline analysis showed that responses were durable, and the safety profile of liso-cel was consistent with prior findings for the CAR T-cell therapy with no new safety signals reported.\n\n\u201cMZL is a slow-growing cancer that, for many, has a favorable prognosis. [However,] for those patients who relapse or become refractory, the disease can be quite aggressive, and there is a need for new effective and tolerable treatment options to address this unmet critical need,\u201d Rosanna Ricafort, vice president and head of the Late Development Program Leadership, Hematology and Cell Therapy, at Bristol Myers Squibb, stated in a news release. \u201cWe are pleased that the TRANSCEND FL study supports the potential of [liso-cel] in MZL and look forward to presenting detailed results from the study at an upcoming medical meeting.\u201d\n\nTRANSCEND FL MZL Cohort Study Design\n\nThe open-label, multicenter, single-arm TRANSCEND FL trial is investigating the efficacy and safety of liso-cel in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma (FL) and MZL.2 To be eligible for enrollment in the MZL cohort, patients must have had MZL that was histologically confirmed within 6 months of screening, as assessed by local pathology; prior treatment with at least 2 lines of systemic therapy that included an anti-CD20 and alkylating agent, or relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplant; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; adequate organ function; and adequate vascular access for leukapheresis.\n\nPatients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with intravenous (IV) fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 plus IV cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 for 3 days prior to liso-cel infusion. Liso-cel was administered on day 1 at a target dose of 100 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells 2 to 7 days after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.\n\nAdditional secondary end points include duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, overall survival, pharmacokinetics, and quality of life.\n\nOutcomes From the FL Cohort\n\nLiso-cel is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent.3 This regulatory decision was supported by findings from the FL cohort of TRANSCEND FL, in which patients who received liso-cel (n = 94) achieved an ORR of 95.7% (95% CI, 89.5%-98.8%). Furthermore, at a median follow-up of 16.8 months (95% CI, 16.3-17.0), the median DOR was not yet reached (NR; 95% CI, 18.04-NR).\n\nAt a data cutoff date of January 27, 2023, and a median follow-up of 18.9 months (range, 0.3-28.2), additional findings showed patients in the FL cohort who received liso-cel in the third line or later experienced an ORR of 97% (95% CI, 91.6%-99.4%; P < .0001) and a CR rate of 94% (95% CI, 87.5%-97.8%; P < .0001).4\n\nRegarding safety, the most common adverse effects were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), headache, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, constipation, and fever.3 The FDA approval of liso-cel for patients with FL included a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy due to the agent\u2019s associated risk of fatal or life-threatening CRS and neurologic toxicities.\n\nThe recommended dose of liso-cel in patients with FL is 90 x 106 to 110 x 106 CAR-positive viable T-cells with a 1:1 ratio of CD4 and CD8 components.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\n| \u00a9 LASZLO\u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nTreatment with venetoclax (Venclexta) plus obinutuzumab (Gazyva) resulted in significantly higher rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) compared with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (Rituxan; FCR) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia who did not harbor 17p deletions or TP53 mutations, according to data from the phase 3 CRISTALLO trial (NCT04285567).\n\nData presented at the 2024 ASH Annual Meeting demonstrated that 81.3% of patients treated with venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (n = 80) achieved undetectable MRD at a sensitivity of less than 10\u207b\u2074 in peripheral blood at month 15 compared with 54.7% of those treated with FCR or BR (n = 86; P = .0004). At the end of treatment, the undetectable MRD rates in the peripheral blood and bone marrow in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm were 81.3% and 70.0%, respectively. In the FCR/BR arm, these respective rates were 60.5% (P = .0053) and 38.4% (P < .0001). Notably, statistical significance could not be determined for the end-of-treatment tests due to hierarchical testing procedures.\n\nAt deeper undetectable minimal residual disease cutoffs, 76.3% and 63.8% of patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm achieved undetectable MRD at thresholds of 10\u207b\u2075 and 10\u207b\u2076, respectively, at month 15, compared with 43.0% and 22.1%, respectively, for those in the FCR/BR arm.\n\n\u201cResults from this trial confirm and extend the findings observed in from the [phase 3] GAIA-CLL 13 trial [NCT02950051], validating increased depth of response with novel therapies compared with existing chemoimmunotherapies,\u201d lead study author Jeff P. Sharman, MD, and colleagues wrote in a poster presentation of the data. Sharman is director of research at the Willamette Valley Cancer Institute in Eugene, Oregon, and medical director of hematology research for The US Oncology Network.\n\nStudy Design\n\nCRISTALLO was an international, open-label, randomized trial that enrolled patients with previously untreated CLL who required systemic therapy. Eligible patients needed to have a cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score of 6 or less and a creatinine clearance of at least 70 mL/min. Patients with 17p deletions or TP53 mutations were excluded. Randomization was stratified based on Binet stage, IGHV mutation status, and age.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive venetoclax and obinutuzumab, or FCR or BR. Venetoclax was administered orally for 12 cycles, beginning with a 5-week ramp-up period before reaching the target dose of 400 mg from cycle 3, day 1 onward. Obinutuzumab was given intravenously for 6 cycles before venetoclax was continued alone for the final 6 cycles. Patients in the control arm received FCR or BR for 6 cycles.\n\nThe trial\u2019s primary end point was the rate of undetectable MRD in peripheral blood at month 15. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS); undetectable MRD rates in peripheral blood and bone marrow at the end of treatment; overall response rate (ORR); duration of response (DOR); and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints included deeper undetectable MRD cutoffs.\n\nBaseline Patient Demographics\n\nThe median age was 62.0 years (range, 40-83) in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm and 61.0 years (range, 36-77) in the FCR/BR arm. The majority of patients in both cohorts were male (venetoclax/obinutuzumab, 68.8%; FCR/BR, 66.3%), had mutatedIGHV (56.3%; 55.8%), had Binet stage B disease (52.5%; 52.3%), and were classified as medium risk for tumor-lysis syndrome (TLS; 62.5%; 59.3%).\n\nAt the time of data cutoff, 83.8% of patients in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab group completed 12 cycles of venetoclax. Additionally, 78.8% completed 6 cycles of venetoclax plus obinutuzumab, and 75.6% of patients in the control group completed 6 cycles of therapy.\n\nAdditional Efficacy and Safety Findings\n\nPFS data were not mature at the time of analysis. Fewer patients had experienced a PFS event in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm (8.8%) compared with the FCR/BR arm (15.1%; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.2-1.3; P = .13). The 2-year PFS rates were 95.7% and 90.4%, respectively.\n\nOS data also remained immature. There was no significant OS difference between treatment arms, and the median OS was not evaluable in either group. Adverse effects (AEs) led to death in 3 patients in each arm, including COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 2) and pneumonia (n = 1) in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm; and COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis (n = 1 each) in the FCR/BR arm.\n\nRegarding safety, AEs occurring in at least 10% of patients included infusion-related reactions (experimental arm, 70.1%; control arm, 42.4%), COVID-19 infections (45.5%; 35.3%), thrombocytopenia (39.0%; 21.2%), diarrhea (35.1%; 12.9%), and nausea (20.8% vs 40.0%).\n\nLaboratory TLS was reported in 10.4% of patients treated with venetoclax plus obinutuzumab compared with 2.4% of those receiving one of the control regimens. No clinical TLS occurred in either arm. Notably, all TLS in the venetoclax plus obinutuzumab arm occurred during obinutuzumab debulking before venetoclax initiation.\n\nReference\n\nSharman JP, Laurenti L, Ferrant E, et al.

            "content": "The government is inviting local and regional authorities across the country to bid to become one of the UK\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) growth zones.\n\nThe plan to develop AI growth zones is part of Labour\u2019s 50-point AI opportunities action plan policy, and is focused on speeding up planning permission for AI-led initiatives.\n\nAt the end of January, science minister Patrick Vallance announced the Culham AI growth zone and his ambition for the so-called Oxford-Cambridge arc \u2013 which covers Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge \u2013 to become a region for tech innovation. \u201cWe are already putting billions behind the Oxford-Cambridge region through East-West Rail, the Culham AI growth zone, and our record-breaking backing for UK R&D,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing Culham, the government now plans to focus on developing AI growth zones in deindustrialised areas of the country. It has encouraged local and regional authorities to submit their proposals, including sites with existing access to power or that would be suitable to establish major energy infrastructure.\n\nSecretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle said: \u201cThese new AI growth zones will deliver untold opportunities \u2013 sparking new jobs, fresh investment and ensuring every corner of the country has a real stake in our AI-powered future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving no stone unturned in how we can harness expertise from all over the UK to deliver new opportunities, fresh growth, better public services and cement our position as an AI pioneer, and that\u2019s the message I will be sending to international partners and AI companies at the AI Action Summit.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s goal is to encourage energy companies and datacentre developers to provide the infrastructure needed to drive forward the roll-out of AI growth zones. It has committed to speeding up planning permission to build out AI infrastructure quickly, which means building out datacentre capacity and providing the energy capacity the power-hungry servers in these datacentres need to run AI workloads. It said it will be working with network operators to scale each zone to 500MW+, which is enough to power roughly two million homes.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) plans to assess proposals from energy providers and datacentre firms to help inform the final selection of sites and broader policy decisions, which are expected later this year.\n\nThe government has already received interest in developing AI growth zones in Scotland, Wales, and north-east and north-west England.\n\nThose involved in bidding and encouraging bidding for AI growth zone status see opportunities to inject new investment and attract skills.\n\nScotland Office minister Kirsty McNeill said: \u201cScotland is already at the centre of these plans, with our world-leading universities at the forefront of AI development and our industrial heritage providing a range of possible sites. I would encourage our local authorities to explore becoming an AI growth zone, which will help attract further investment.\u201d\n\nTees Valley mayor Ben Houchen hopes to attract people with high tech skills to work in the region. \u201cMy job, above everything, is to bring good, well-paid, long-term jobs to local people. We have everything we need to host an AI growth zone in our region. We have the land, we have the power and we have shown in our efforts at Teesworks how we can get huge projects moving forward at pace,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the ongoing challenges facing the UK as it pivots to a high-tech-led industrial strategy is that while there are plenty of great ideas and startups with innovative products, scaling these commercially is a major barrier. Earlier this month, witness statements published in the latest edition of the AI and creative technology scaleup report for the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee described the UK as \u201cterrible place\u201d to scale up startup businesses.",

Moreover, at a median follow-up of 46.9 months (95% CI, 43.4-55.0), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.3-5.4) and the median overall survival (OS) was 14.8 months (95% CI, 6.7-28.2).\n\n\u201cThe PEACOCC trial showed clinical benefit with pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated advanced CCGC, of whom all except 1 had mismatch repair\u2013proficient [MMR] disease,\u201d Rebecca Kristeleit, MD, PhD, of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Kings College London, in London, United Kingdom, and colleagues, wrote in the paper. \u201cClinical outcomes were durable with an overall tolerable safety profile, justifying further evaluation of pembrolizumab monotherapy for advanced CCGC in a randomized clinical trial.\u201d\n\nThe multicenter, single-arm trial enrolled patients with CCGC, including ovarian, endometrial, vaginal, vulval, and cervical cancer who were at least 18 years of age who had received 1 or more prior courses of platinum chemotherapy, including in the adjuvant setting. They had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria and investigator assessment, and disease amenable to biopsy. Patients were excluded if they had known autoimmune disease, second malignancy, central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis, untreated venous thrombosis, or hospitalization for bowel obstruction within 4 weeks.\n\nStudy participants were given 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously, once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. They continued to receive the immunotherapy until radiographic progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawn consent, physician decision, or 35 cycles were completed.\n\nIn addition to PFS at 12 weeks serving as the trial\u2019s primary end point, secondary end points included ORR, duration of response (DOR), PFS, OS, safety, and quality of life.\n\nThe median patient age was 58.5 years (range, 32-77). Regarding clear cell cancer type, 85% had ovarian, 13% had endometrial, and 2% had cervical. In terms of ECOG performance status, 54% had a status of 0 and the remainder had a status of 1. Patients had a FIGO stage of I (38%), II (19%), III (29%), or IV (15%) at the time of diagnosis. Most previously underwent surgery (90%) but had not previously received radiotherapy (77%). All received prior systemic treatment, with a median of 3 prior courses (range, 1-6). Forty percent of patients had a platinum-free interval of longer 12 months; 31% had an interval ranging from 6 to 12 months and 29% had an interval of less than 6 months. The median cancer antigen 125 was 117.5 U/mL (range, 5-4375).\n\nAdditional efficacy data showed that in the 20 patients who had confirmed disease control at 12 weeks, the median duration of control from the initiation of pembrolizumab was 11.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-16.5). In the 12 patients who experienced response, the median time from pembrolizumab initiation to disease response was 2.2 months (95% CI, 1.3-2.8); the median DOR was 13.1 months (95% CI, 4.2-26.5).\n\nThe 1-year PFS rate was 21% (95% CI, 11%-33%) and the 2-year PFS rate was 8% (95% CI, 3%-18%); the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 54% (95% CI, 39%-67%) and 38% (95% CI, 24%-51%), respectively.\n\nOne patient enrolled for retreatment with the immunotherapy after their disease progressed. They received 6 cycles of the immunotherapy and stopped treatment because of immune-related hepatitis that was grade 3 in severity. Their best response to retreatment with pembrolizumab was disease stability, and they progressed for the second time 7.1 months from their first progression.\n\nPatients had received a median of 4.5 cycles (interquartile range, 1.5-12) of pembrolizumab. Eighty-one percent of patients discontinued treatment because of disease progression. The most common treatment-related adverse effects were diarrhea (grade 1, 17%; grade 2, 2%; grade 3, 0%), fatigue (17%; 13%; 0%), pruritus (17%; 4%; 0%), maculopapular rash (13%; 2%; 0%), nausea (10%; 4%; 0%), oral mucositis (8%; 0%; 0%), dry skin (8%; 0%; 0%), dry mouth (8%; 2%; 0%), anorexia (8%; 6%; 0%), vomiting (6%; 0%; 0%), hypothyroidism (6%; 15%; 0%), hyperthyroidism (6%; 4%; 4%), dysgeusia (6%; 0%; 0%), cough (6%; 0%; 0%), increased alkaline phosphatase (4%; 4%; 2%), rash (4%; 2%; 0%), increased alanine aminotransferase (2%; 4%; 4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2%; 4%; 2%), acute kidney injury (0%; 0%; 2%), anemia (0%; 0%; 2%), increased y-glutamyltransferase (0%; 0%; 2%), immune-related hepatitis (0%; 0%; 2%), ketoacidosis (0%; 0%; 2%), and noninfective encephalitis (0%; 0%; 2%).\n\nThe single-arm design and moderate sample size represent the key limitations of the study.\n\n\u201cPembrolizumab has robust, durable clinical benefit in patients with heavily pretreated CCGC and was tolerated in the overall population. The clinical activity was observed in a predominantly MMR-proficient population,\u201d the study authors concluded. \u201cClinical outcomes are superior to historical data for current standard-of-care chemotherapy, and translational research to identify those patients who benefit most is underway. Further evaluation of anti\u2013PD-1 monotherapy or PD-1 inhibitor combinations in randomized clinical trials is justified for this poor-prognosis gynecologic cancer population with a significant unmet clinical need.\u201d\n\nReference\n\nKristeleit R, Devlin M-J, Clamp A, et al.

            "content": "Adobe (ADBE -2.28%) shareholders might wish they could use Photoshop, the tech giant's flagship image-editing tool, to magically erase the stock's disappointing performance in 2024. Despite solid growth and record profitability, shares are down about 30% in the past year. This seems related to uncertainty in the market about how the digital media giant is managing the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), as both a competitive threat and a significant opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, Adobe remains on a firm footing into 2025, supported by overall strong fundamentals and several factors positioning the stock to rebound. With shares trading near a 52-week low, let's look at three reasons that Adobe shares look like a great buy.\n\n1. Adobe's AI leadership\n\nFor over 30 years, Adobe has built a global leadership position in software categories spanning creative media, marketing tools, and document management. Its extensive portfolio of products like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Adobe Acrobat are recognized as industry standards, serving everyone from global enterprises down to amateur creators.\n\nA large part of the company's success has been its ability to constantly innovate, with that legacy a core part of its current AI strategy. Adobe has integrated AI and machine learning features across its app ecosystem, a major upgrade in functionality that improves productivity and enhances the user experience. Multiple generative AI models in Adobe Firefly are seen as game changers in the creative process.\n\nWhile specialized AI companies like privately held Canva and OpenAI have introduced text-to-image and video generation features, Adobe maintains a significant advantage, with its more comprehensive offerings integrated with a professional-level application suite.\n\nUltimately, Adobe's AI initiatives should further cement its market positioning and open up new growth opportunities. If you're confident in the company's ability to navigate its strategy for the changing technology landscape, you have a great reason to buy and hold the stock for the long run.\n\n2. Adobe's strong growth outlook\n\nAdobe's recent trends have been impressive. In its fiscal 2024's fourth quarter (which ended Nov. 29), sales climbed by 11% year over year, alongside a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Management highlighted significant demand from its AI offerings in segments like Digital Media, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud.\n\nThe metric that stood out was Adobe's remaining performance obligations (RPO) exiting the year at $19.96 billion, up 16% from the prior year. RPO represents the total value of subscriptions or services yet to be delivered to customers, which offers good insight into the company's growth runway.\n\nFor 2025, Adobe is targeting revenue growth of 8.3% to 9.5%, with a forecast for adjusted EPS of between $20.20 and $20.50 -- representing a 10.5% increase at the midpoint compared to the previous year. While these guidance figures fall slightly short of initial Wall Street estimates, triggering the recent stock-price volatility, the bigger takeaway is that operating and financial momentum are positive.\n\nHere's the bullish case for the stock in the year ahead. Adobe has plenty of room to outperform its expectations over the next few quarters, which would be a catalyst for the stock to rally higher.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 (Estimate) Revenue (in billions) $21.51 $23.30 to $23.55 Revenue growth (YOY) 11% 8.3% to 9.5% Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $18.42 $20.20 to $20.50 Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 14.6% 9.7% to 11.3%\n\n3. Adobe's bargain valuation\n\nPerhaps the most compelling reason to buy Adobe stock right now is its attractive valuation. Shares are currently trading at under 22 times forward earnings (based on consensus 2025 estimates), a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that's deeply discounted from its historical five-year average of about 46.\n\nOne interpretation is that the stock is undervalued, considering its outlook for double-digit earnings growth and exposure to high-level themes within AI. Even within the broader tech sector, Adobe stands out as a value stock next to other software names such as Microsoft or Salesforce, each currently trading with a forward P/E of around 31.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI'm bullish on Adobe, and believe all the pieces are in place for the company to reward shareholders into 2025 and beyond. The recent sell-off looks like a golden opportunity to buy into Adobe's story of innovation, growth, and market leadership.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 44.3%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) operates as a diversified software company. The company\u2019s highly differentiated technology platforms, the pace of innovation, diversified go-to-market, and integration of clouds place it well for long-term growth. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) saw $21.51 billion in revenue, $8.06 billion in cash flows from operations, and $19.96 billion in RPO in FY24. The company\u2019s strategy, AI innovation, and massive cross-cloud opportunity place it well for 2025 and beyond.\n\nIts continued focus on expanding its enterprise customer base offers a strong opportunity for long-term growth. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s comprehensive suite of creative, document, and experience management solutions places it well to capture a significant share of enterprise IT budgets. With well-established organizations increasingly prioritizing digital transformation and customer experience initiatives, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s integrated offerings become more attractive. Furthermore, its healthy relationships with Fortune 100 companies continue to offer a strong foundation for upselling and cross-selling additional products and services.\n\nThe enterprise customers are more stable and less price-sensitive as compared to individual consumers or small businesses. By deepening its enterprise relationships, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) can potentially shield itself from competitive pressures in the broader market while, at the same time, fuel recurring revenue growth, courtesy of long-term contracts and expanded service adoption.\n\nOverall ADBE ranks 3rd on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

That\u2019s because at some point, an evil presence rose from the pit (or a boardroom \u2013 same thing) and decreed software should no longer be something you owned outright. And then furiously mashed \u2018software\u2019 into \u2018services\u2019 with a fork. The resultant goop transformed into a product you merely rented. Need to perform some Photoshop magic today? Pay your monthly Adobe \u2018tribute\u2019 or they\u2019ll cut you off! (Unless you can somehow coax that DVD of Photoshop Stone Age Edition to work on a modern computer.)\n\nThis is bad enough with apps you use fairly often. It\u2019s even worse when companies treat you like a cash machine when you rarely use an app. You forget all about it and then \u2013 BAM! \u2013 surprise inevitable email that you\u2019ve just been charged. Super Inbox Pro: 15 bucks! Learny Thing Ultimate: 100 bucks! Super Duper Everything You Thought You Wanted But Never Used Omniverse Nirvana Godlike Edition: almost-like-a-mortgage bucks!\n\nIt\u2019s all awful. Except it isn\u2019t. Because not all app subscriptions are entirely evil. At least in theory.\n\nApp to the future\n\nPlay A visual representation of platform stability whenever new operating system updates appear.\n\nAt this point, I imagine a few readers are eyeing this column suspiciously \u2013 or making plans to call me a massive idiot-brained idiot-faced idiot on Bluesky. But wait. Because I have a bit of a caveat. It\u2019s that not all app subscriptions are entirely evil. Emphasis on the \u2018all\u2019. And that\u2019s because a pay-once model is in some cases today as archaic as Photoshop 1.0.\n\nMuch of that is because apps have to deal with the moving targets of hardware that evolves at a blistering pace and operating systems that won\u2019t stand still for five minutes before shaking things up with a new feature set. Which for app creators regularly presents much the same level of stability as shaking up a bottle of soda into which you\u2019ve unwisely fed an entire family pack of Mentos.\n\nFor giant corporations, I\u2019d have to break out the electron microscope to find my pity violin when it comes to this issue. But for tiny indies, it does feel a bit off to expect a one-off payment of a few bucks to give you unlimited updates for an app until the heat death of the universe.\n\nThe human touch\n\nOne day, we\u2019ll tell our children this is how we dealt with app subscriptions before Kagi had its brainwave. Probably. (Image: Markus Winkler.)\n\nSo what is the solution? We all hate app subscriptions. But without app subscriptions, lots of apps suddenly cease to be viable. Search engine Kagi has a solution: \u2018fair pricing\u2019.The idea is absurdly simple. If you don\u2019t use Kagi during your billing cycle, the service credits you for a month. Instantly, frustration is gone. No more busywork, regularly checking subscriptions. An end to unexpected bills for something you haven\u2019t used. The eradication of that stupid (yet effective) technique of immediately cancelling a subscription the second it\u2019s made, to ensure billing won\u2019t recur.\n\nOf course, maybe Kagi\u2019s plan won\u2019t work either. There\u2019s a possibility that, months from now, it will subtly shift from \u2018fair pricing\u2019 to \u2018fair warning: next month, we\u2019re going to fleece you for our own survival\u2019. I hope not. Kagi\u2019s system feels well-suited to a service that believes that it offers value \u2013 and is confident you\u2019ll return, even if you pause payment for a while. And in an age of increasingly draconian tech, I rather like that one company is doing something radically different: offering an app subscription that it\u2019s impossible to hate.",

            "content": "Looking Ahead to the AI Action Summit: Seizing the AI Opportunity\n\nThe upcoming AI Action Summit taking place in Paris next week represents a pivotal moment for public and private sectors to come together in shaping a common approach to responsible and ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI). Building upon previous Summits in Bletchley Park and Seoul, this year\u2019s Summit will have a new focus on seizing the opportunities that AI presents through the responsible development and deployment of technologies.\n\nWith the upcoming AI Action Summit, we see key areas where governments from around the world and industry can come together in ensuring AI innovation thrives in the right way for everyone.\n\nHelping creators protect their style and livelihoods\n\nAt Adobe, we believe AI should advance creative careers, not threaten them. One of the main concerns we\u2019ve heard from creators is related to style, specifically when someone uses AI to mimic an artist\u2019s style and then passes off the AI-generated work as the original artist\u2019s. In the age of AI, it takes just a few clicks for a bad actor to use an AI model to reproduce art works in a certain style and pass it off as the original artist\u2019s, essentially forcing artists to compete against themselves in the marketplace.\n\nAdobe has been advocating for a federal anti-impersonation right that helps protect creators against bad actors who use an AI model explicitly to impersonate their style for commercial gain. The recent legislative effort, Preventing Abuse of Digital Replicas Act (PADRA) in the U.S., is a critical step towards ensuring the responsible use of AI-generated content.\n\nCreators using AI tools also want to ensure they can obtain copyright protection over their work in this new era. Copyright law is designed to protect human creativity \u2013 therefore an AI output alone may not be copyrightable, but we believe the combination of human creativity and AI will and should be. The U.S. Copyright Office recently issued guidance on this topic, concluding similarly that works that people create or edit with assistance from AI can be copyrighted, but that works generated entirely by an AI system or based purely on text prompts are not eligible. We encourage governments around the world to establish clear guidance for how creators can earn a copyright for their works that include AI as part of the creative process.\n\n\u201cWe all share a responsibility to ensure that AI innovation develops in a way that benefits everyone. Protecting artists from commercial, AI-based exploitation is in all of our best interests and we\u2019re committed to advocating for policies that support artists, and empower them to thrive in the age of AI\u201d Karen Robinson, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, Adobe\n\nLegislation can be a vital deterrent to bad actors, and technological solutions can also strengthen creators\u2019 options. To give creators more control over how their content is used, the recently announced Adobe Content Authenticity Web App empowers creators by giving them the option to attach Content Credentials to gain attribution for their work and signal to other generative AI models if they do not want their content to be used for AI training, and is also actively working to drive industry-wide adoption for this feature.\n\nCombatting the dangers of deepfakes\n\nWith advancements in AI, content creation and editing has become more powerful for creators and more accessible than ever for consumers. But the power of anything good can also be used for bad. AI tools can be weaponised to create deepfakes that undermine national security, seed discord, and even influence elections.\n\nOne of the most critical guardrails needed in the age of AI is ensuring we have the right tools and policies to combat harmful deepfakes and deceptive digital content. Without tools and standards to help guard against these threats, we risk the ability to tell the difference between fact and fiction.\n\nTo combat deepfakes and build trust and transparency in digital content, governments can leverage industry standards such as Content Credentials, which essentially serve as a \u201cnutrition label\u201d for digital content. Developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), Content Credentials are a free, open-source, technical standard that can provide detail on who made a piece of content, as well as how, where, and whether AI was used. It empowers consumers to verify and then trust, navigating the digital ecosystem with greater clarity.\n\nThe Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) is a global, cross industry coalition, supported by over 4,000 members, that is working to advance free, open-source implementations of Content Credentials provenance technology. Having already been integrated into Adobe apps that creators know and love including Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro and Adobe Express, Content Credentials are also being adopted by CAI and C2PA members including Leica, the BBC, Agence France Presse (AFP), Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and most recently, Samsung in their new Galaxy S25 smartphone. Widespread adoption of Content Credentials across the content supply chain will play a vital role in realising a more trustworthy and transparent digital ecosystem.\n\nGovernments also have a crucial part to play in driving adoption of this standard by including provenance requirements in AI legislation for those that make, use, and distribute content \u2013 from manufacturers of cameras and smartphones to social media platforms and news websites. Governments should seek to make content provenance technology available to users, as well as ensure that online platforms and social media companies implement Content Credentials capabilities and do not strip away any metadata associated with content published on their platforms.\n\nGovernments can also build trust with their citizens by incorporating content provenance technology into the content they publish. By using Content Credentials, governments provide citizens with a way to verify the authenticity of the content they are viewing. This can be a critical tool to leverage when policymakers need a trusted way to communicate with the public. Finally, industry, academia, and government need to work together to raise awareness about the risks of deepfakes and teach the public how to use tools like Content Credentials.\n\nCommitment to Responsible Innovation\n\nAt Adobe, we have long been committed to responsible innovation. Our approach to developing generative AI is guided by our longstanding AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency, and rooted in support for the creative community. As an example, when we started developing Adobe Firefly, our family of creative generative AI models, we made the decision to train it exclusively on content that Adobe has permission to use \u2013 including licensed content from Adobe Stock and public domain content \u2013 and never on user content.\n\nOur deliberate approach to training Firefly ensures that it is commercially safe, giving everyone - from creators to enterprise customers \u2013 confidence in using it. This is evidenced by the incredible adoption of Firefly, which has been used to generate over 16 billion images globally. With Firefly, we have demonstrated that it is possible to develop best-in-class generative AI models without having to infringe on the rights of creators.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that AI is only as good as the data it is trained on\u2014more data likely means more accurate and less biased outcomes. As governments around the world develop their approach AI, supporting access to quality data to ensure AI innovation continues to thrive both accurately and responsibly is important.\n\nCollaboration for Responsible AI Future\n\nWe stand at a transformative moment with AI, and collaboration between policymakers, creators, industry and the public will be vital to ensuring that AI accelerates creativity and opportunities while also ensuring the right guardrails in place.\n\nIn this spirit, as part of the official AI Action Summit Business Day on 11 February, we will be leading a discussion on the adoption of Content Credentials to restore trust and transparency in the era of synthetic media alongside Microsoft, Google, Imatag, AFP, and French lawmaker Violette Spillebout.\n\nAs we look ahead to the AI Action Summit, we look forward to continuing to work with governments globally to ensure AI is developed and deployed in the right way for everyone.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other AI stocks sending shockwaves on Wall Street following DeepSeek scare.\n\nThe pace of artificial intelligence development and deployment is \u201cpretty terrifying\u201d. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed by Steven Adler, a former safety researcher at OpenAI. The remarks come amid growing concerns that robust AI systems capable of evading human control could come into being with catastrophic consequences.\n\nAmid the safety concerns raised, tech giants and emerging startups are not showing signs of slowing down on AI spending. They are allocating billions of dollars on capital expenditures to accelerate the development of powerful AI systems. Bloomberg expects capital expenditures in the development of various AI solutions to exceed $200 billion in 2025, representing a $90 billion increase from last year.\n\nHigher capital expenditure should result in new innovations resulting in the widespread use of AI in many industries. Similarly, AI is predicted to transform various sectors, including healthcare, retail, finance, and the automotive industry.\n\nNevertheless, billionaire investor Steve Cohen believes AI\u2019s transformational shift could take decades to realize. \u201cThis is a 10- to 20-year theme. It\u2019s going to affect everybody in how they conduct their lives, how they do their business,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the first, second inning of something that\u2019s going to be transformational for the economy and the world. \u2026 It is such a dramatic, important shift that to ignore it, I think it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe CEO and chairman of hedge fund Point72 maintains that there may be ups and downs in the AI boom and that the volatility surrounding investments related to AI may worsen due to a lack of reliable information. However, the increasing need for cutting-edge AI technologies like deep learning and robotics may present difficulties for hardware parts like AI chips. That\u2019s because the high processing demands of AI algorithms and machine learning models are beyond the capabilities of conventional CPUs and GPUs. Top tech firms must increase their expenditures and production to overcome these obstacles.\n\nBecause AI applications like generative AI and large language models require massive data processing, energy efficiency is another issue. Potential remedies include quantum computing and high bandwidth memory, but each has drawbacks. Amid the ever-growing energy needs needed to power AI models and infrastructure, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has urged President Donald Trump to take the threat of tariffs off the table definitively. According to Freeland, the US needs Canadian energy to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence. Freeland insists the US should thank Canada for being \u201ca great partner\u201d that can provide the much-needed power to dominate the AI space.\n\nStory Continues",

The buyer was Shea Sullivan, according to public records. She was represented by Laura Kaufman at Corcoran Icon. Kaufman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nListing agent Lauren Klapper of City Real Estate would not confirm the buyer or seller identities, but said the sellers put the home on the market because they moved into a larger home in San Francisco.\n\nKlapper said the asking price on the home, which the Warnocks acquired in 2012, was \u201ctotally fair,\u201d and not strategically underpriced to elicit multiple offers, as is common in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful property so I wasn\u2019t surprised by the interest in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it to go as far over asking as it did.\u201d\n\nMaking sure that it was among the first to hit the market in the $5 million to $10 million range this year was a strategic gamble that paid off with the \u201camazing\u201d response, Klapper said.\n\n\u201cWe toyed with coming to market the Monday after the Super Bowl,\u201d she said, as the big game typically marks the start date for the city\u2019s spring market. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing like this in the market and I know that all my buyers are itching to get into places. I\u2019m like, why not? Let\u2019s just bring it on and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe home came to market on Jan. 7, elicited 25 requests for disclosures and seven offers, six of which were all cash. After an offer date when Klapper asked buyers to come in with their highest and best offers, an all-cash offer at $6.8 million was accepted on Jan. 17. It closed 13 days later.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nCompetition on the home was boosted by two buyers from Los Angeles who were either displaced by the fires in Pacific Palisades themselves or had family members who were, she added. More displaced Angelenos also toured the property but didn\u2019t end up making an offer.\n\nKlapper attributed the quick, competitive sale to its location \u2014 a block from the Palace of Fine Arts and the Presidio and walking distance to shops and restaurants on Chestnut Street \u2014 as well as its size, natural light, large yard, \u201ccompletely turnkey\u201d interiors, and luxurious bonuses like a wine cellar and infrared sauna.\n\nShe added that the election of San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has buoyed buyer morale across the higher end.\n\n\u201cPeople are ready to invest again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like there was a complete shift once he came to office.\u201d\n\nThe AI boom and the well-performing stock market have helped as well, she said. But it is too early in the spring season to tell if the Beach Street sale marks a return of the city\u2019s infamous over-asking trend, she said, or if it will end up being just a unique example of the rare home that \u201cchecked every box\u201d and came on at just the right time.\n\n\u201cIf this is a benchmark of what\u2019s to come in 2025, I feel very hopeful,\u201d she said, before clarifying, \u201cas a selling agent, not as a buying agent.\u201d",

            "content": "Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this software maker have returned +3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 0.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.02 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Adobe, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.65 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.45 billion and $25.77 billion estimates indicate +9% and +9.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAdobe reported revenues of $5.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $4.81 for the same period compares with $4.27 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.22%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAdobe is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Unmetered access to the complete Substance 3D Assets library means subscribers have access to the full collection of nearly 20,000 professional materials, models and lighting environments.\n\nYou get the feeling that Adobe is preparing a serious push on its Substance 3D interlinked offering of five apps for 3D design as the year goes on. It sits outside the scope of the normal Creative Cloud offering, instead allowing access to a range of tools at two monthly price points.\n\nAdobe Substance 3D Texturing provides access to Substance 3D Painter, Designer and Sampler for $19.99 a month; while Adobe Substance 3D Collection adds the 3D Modeler and Stager into the mix for $49.99. Both tiers now get full access to the growing Substance 3D Assets library without having to manage how much they are consuming within a calendar month.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in the library too. There are 13,000 materials in three distinct categories: Surfaces that can be tiled across any surface; Decals, specialized materials perfect for adding details, wear and unique characteristics; and Atlases, collections of individual elements that can be scattered on surfaces to create more detailed materials.\n\nThese are joined by 6000 3D models that come production-ready in either .fbx or .glb formats with professionally unwrapped UVs; cleaned and optimized polygon counts; and organized sub-components with proper pivot points. And there is also a collection of 3D HDR Lights to choose from that offer independent control over individual light sources and adjustable parameters for temperature, intensity and color.\n\nPerhaps one of the standout features of the library though is the degree of parametric customization that is built into it. As Adobe explains, each material includes built-in parameters that let you adjust attributes like color, surface finish, pattern scale and more \u2014 while maintaining photorealistic quality. This flexibility means a single material can be used as a jumping off point for generating countless variations.\n\n\u201cUnmetered access transforms how you work, letting you download assets on-demand for concept exploration and mood boarding while quickly iterating on designs with ready-to-use models and materials,\u201d the company explains in a blog post. \u201cYou can maintain consistent quality from concept to final render and focus on creating without worrying about download limits. This freedom also opens opportunities to learn from professional material graphs and techniques, and experiment with infinite variations through parametric controls.\u201d\n\nMore substantial information at www.adobe.com/products/substance3d.html.\n\ntl;dr",

This year, these technologies are on the trajectory to further advancements and widespread adoption. Tony Paine, CEO, co-founder at HighByte, says these technologies have accelerated the ability to solve a greater number of use cases, specifically across industrial sectors, driving value through an organization.\n\n\"The solutions to these use cases can no longer be static and must follow agile methodologies to continuously evolve and meet ongoing / new business requirements,\" says Paine. \"Outsourcing projects won't decline, as global systems integrators (GSIs) will continue to be leveraged to accelerate implementation and plan for scale, but there will be more pressure to understand the scope and implementation of outsourced projects. Bringing more expertise in-house will allow for incremental improvements over time by internal staff \u2013 allowing organizations to minimize recurring costs.\"\n\nCouple this with the use of generative AI and LLMs, businesses are finding success in diversifying their repertoire of technology. According to John Harrington, chief product officer, co-founder at HighByte, throughout the year, we will see an increase in AI agents to help solve real business problems.\n\nThe quantity of agents, Harrington suspects, should eclipse the number of individual applications we use today, making modern data integration and highly capable data infrastructure critical \u2014 this will require data infrastructure that not only provides orchestration but also ensures high quality, visibility, security and governance.\n\n\"Many manufacturers are moving their industrial data to the cloud, driving the adoption of Industrial DataOps and the Unified Namespace. These practices enhance the speed and agility of delivering the right data to the cloud in a usable format. As a result, 2025 will be the year manufacturing companies develop robust data strategies, implement Industrial DataOps practices, and invest in their data infrastructure to enable their AI strategy,\" says Harrington. And that's just the tip of the iceberg as the sector moves on into emerging technology territory and continues to grow well past the days of outdated infrastructure.",

The survey also found that 61% of knowledge workers have signed a contract at work without knowing what\u2019s in it while 63% of technology leaders say difficulty interpreting contracts and confusing terms has caused business delays.\n\nLast year, Adobe introduced Acrobat AI Assistant, a conversational engine integrated deeply into Reader and Acrobat workflows that generates summaries and insights, answers questions, and can even format information for sharing in emails, reports, and presentations.

Finance teams can accelerate reviews of sales contracts and marketers can pinpoint changes in updated scopes of work and quickly find deliverables in brand and advertising partnerships.\n\nProtecting data and enhancing reliability\n\nAs the inventor and innovator of PDF, Adobe Acrobat has become a core productivity tool for more than 650 million monthly active users who open 400+ billion PDFs in the app each month.\n\nAdobe Acrobat AI Assistant supplements LLM technologies with the same artificial intelligence and machine learning models behind Liquid Mode, the technology that supports responsive reading experiences for PDFs on mobile. These models provide a highly accurate understanding of PDF structure and content, enhancing the quality and reliability of AI Assistant\u2019s outputs.\n\nBudhaditya Baul, Director of Product Management at Adobe, manages Document Cloud\u2019s Generative AI efforts for 0-1 products such as Liquid Mode, AI Assistant, and other projects currently in incubation.

            "content": "Generative AI burst into the public consciousness with the 2022 release of ChatGPT. Since then, AI\u2019s development has accelerated at a pace that is exhilarating and disorienting. Unlike past technological revolutions which primarily targeted manufacturing jobs, this wave of innovation is rewriting the rules for all, from workers in service industries to artists in creative fields. The rapid evolution of this technology is raising questions about its real impact on the workforce.\n\nThe debate over how automation impacts the workforce is age-old. Philosophers and economists have wrestled with these questions for centuries. Aristotle mused about tools that could operate independently, hinting at an early conception of automation. Centuries later, Adam Smith and Karl Marx examined the tensions between technological progress and labor, offering contrasting visions of how innovation shapes society. Smith advocated for machinery to amplify human labor and highlighted the importance of specialization. Marx worried about machines disempowering workers.\n\nIn 2023, Salesforce reported that more than 90% of surveyed workers felt that automation had increased their productivity, with 93% adopting a positive view after using it. The reason is simple; humans and technology go together. The strongest business results come from using technology as a tool rather than attempting to create a standalone replacement for human employees. This amplifying effect is why Goldman Sachs predicts that the integration of AI into the workplace has the potential to increase global GDP by 7%.\n\nWhile AI is undeniably reshaping industries across the board, its impact on office-based jobs and manufacturing may unfold along different trajectories. AI seems to threaten to displace human workers in the service sector in a way that feels unprecedented, whereas in the manufacturing sector this wave appears to be continuing a familiar pattern: transforming the role of human workers rather than entirely replacing them. The AI revolution in the physical world, rather than heralding the end of work, will most likely be powered by humans. Why? Robotics and automation, like prior industrial developments, excel at repetitive, mundane, sometimes physically challenging tasks. Humans excel at edge case situations. Near term, AI will not change that reality.\n\nIn fact, the application of industrial automation and physical AI has huge potential to boost employee experiences while also creating new jobs through the integration of solutions which require oversight, maintenance and service. These connected systems generate valuable data benefitting employees and open new strategic opportunities through data analysis and predictive action.\n\nBeyond the capacity to create new roles, industrial automation also improves the safety of the workplace. The tasks that AI and advanced robotics are tackling are often the most physically demanding and dangerous to perform. These factors lead to high rates of turnover in associated roles, while injuries caused by repeated strains and heavy lifting have the capacity to become chronic health issues. Further bottlenecks in staffing can also be resolved for industries with high seasonal variability, where demand for temporary labor ebbs and flows leading to increased competition for talent.\n\nVoices on both sides of the AI argument tend to understate just how difficult it actually is to replace the critical thinking, responsiveness, and ingenuity that are unique to human employees. Current AI and robotic automation tools may not be anywhere near doing that, but what they can achieve is no less impressive when it comes to pure productivity. The automation journey is still in its early days. As of 2021, only 5% of warehouses were fully automated and over 80% had no automation technology in use whatsoever. The next phase is more automation working alongside humans, not replacing them; \u201cdark warehouses\u201d that eliminate human workers may not actually be achievable for decades, if at all.\n\nTaking a typical e-commerce warehouse as an example, robotic automation solutions can retrieve goods from a picking area and bring them directly to packers. From there, human packers can place goods directly into pre-erected boxes that pass down the line for automated height-reduction and sealing. Mispacks can be identified by computer vision systems and rerouted to manual triage lanes where employees can address them before they turn into costly downstream issues. Unplanned work is converted into planned work. The warehouse picks up speed and efficiency. Packing is stream-lined and uses less material. Jobs that might have required manually finding items across the warehouse to place into plastic totes for retrieval can now be focused on an ergonomic pack station. New, quality jobs are created via the technician requirements for maintaining automated systems, the strategic roles needed to react to captured data, and the shortened training times for new hires working with automated systems. This is how warehouse jobs can be brought into the future, with humans leveraging technology for their mutual benefit.\n\nIt\u2019s time to challenge the misconception that physical AI and robotics will be job killers. Upskilling, reskilling, enhancing safety and boosting productivity should be the key areas of focus. Employers and early adopters who approach this the right way will gain more efficiencies and will attract more talent. At the end of the day, they will be offering better quality of work to their workforce. The companies that provide this kind of environment will position themselves to be the leaders of tomorrow, along with their employees.",

The risk:benefit profile for ziftomenib was encouraging, and the safety and tolerability of ziftomenib were consistent with previous reports.\n\nFindings from the trial have been submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Kura Oncology intends to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in the second quarter of 2025 seeking the approval of ziftomenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AML harboring NPM1 mutations.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to report positive topline results in [patients with] relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML, underscoring the strong foundation for our ziftomenib program to potentially transform the treatment landscape for these patients,\u201d Troy Wilson, PhD, JD, president and chief executive officer of Kura Oncology, stated in a news release. \u201cWe believe this achievement for our KOMET-001 trial positions Kura and Kyowa Kirin to deliver on its path to commercialization of ziftomenib, beginning with our potential first NDA submission in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML next quarter. Furthermore, we believe the positive FDA interactions for the [phase 3] KOMET-017 protocol, including the opportunity for accelerated approval in both trials, pave the way for us to position ziftomenib as a potential frontline therapy to address up to 50% of patients with AML.\u201d\n\nKOMET-001 was designed to assess evidence of clinical activity, safety, and tolerability of ziftomenib. In April 2024, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to ziftomenib for the treatment of heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML, which marked ziftomenib as the first investigational agent to be granted breakthrough therapy designation for this patient population.2\n\nEligibility criteria included patients at least 18 years of age; an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; a life expectancy of at least 2 months; adequate liver and kidney function; and peripheral white blood cell counts of 30000/\u03bcL or fewer.3 However, hydroxyurea was permitted to control and maintain white blood cell count before trial enrollment. Trial exclusion criteria included those with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and clinically active central nervous system leukemia.\n\nAll patients received ziftomenib monotherapy during the single-arm trial. Along with the CR/CRh primary end point in phase 2, secondary end points included CR rate with and without minimal residual disease negativity; duration of response; transfusion independence; event-free survival; and overall survival.\n\nIn the phase 1a/1b portion of the KOMET-001 study, 60% (n = 83/139) of screened patients received at least 1 dose of ziftomenib (phase 1a, n = 30; phase 1b, n = 53).4 In phase 1a (dose escalation), patients were treated with ziftomenib at 50 mg (n = 1), 100 mg (n = 1), 200 mg (n = 6), 400 mg (n = 5), 600 mg (n = 5), 800 mg (n = 11), and 1000 mg (n = 1). In phase 1b (dose validation and dose expansion), patients were either randomly assigned to 1:1 to dose validation (n = 34) or allocated to dose expansion (n = 19) to receive 600 mg of ziftomenib as the recommended phase 2 dose. Patients in the dose-validation group were treated with ziftomenib at 200 mg (n = 17) or 600 mg (n = 17).\n\nThe KOMET-017 protocol will include the phase 3 KOMET-017-IC trial evaluating ziftomenib or placebo in combination with 7+3 induction chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed NPM1-mutant or KMT2A-rearranged AML.1 KOMET-017-NIC will examine ziftomenib or placebo plus venetoclax (Venclexta) and azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed NPM1-mutant AML who are unable receive intensive chemotherapy. Both trials are expected to initiate in the second half of 2025.\n\nReferences",

The focus should be on collaboration and designing frameworks that ensure AI serves as a tool to enhance, rather than undermine, human ingenuity.\n\nWho is responsible for AI regulation?\n\nAs AI becomes woven into the fabric of creative workflows, the question of regulation grows more urgent. But who should shoulder this responsibility?\n\nAI impacts everyone\u2014consumers, private businesses and regulators alike. This interconnectedness underscores the need for collective action. Policymakers must collaborate with industry leaders to develop transparent, enforceable guidelines, while businesses and creatives must advocate for ethical practices that align with their values.\n\nWhat role does authenticity play in the future?\n\nIn a world where AI-generated content is increasingly prevalent, ensuring authenticity has never been more important. How can we distinguish what\u2019s real from what\u2019s fake or, at least, digitally altered?\n\nThis is where initiatives like Adobe\u2019s Content Credentials come into play. By embedding verified metadata into creative assets, Content Credentials offer a way to track and confirm the origin of digital content. Lee sees this as a critical step in bridging the gap between the rise of AI and the preservation of creative integrity.\n\nFostering open dialogue, sharing responsibility for regulation and embracing technologies like Content Credentials will help to ensure that creativity thrives in an AI-driven world.\n\nLearn more about the Content Authenticity Initiative, co-founded by Adobe with the goal of fostering greater trust and transparency online.\n\nDiscover even more creative opportunities with Adobe Firefly, integrated with Adobe Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator.",

            "content": "Adobe\n\nWe all have to deal with contracts and agreements as consumers or business professionals. However, as most contracts are written in legalese, understanding them can be challenging. To ease the pain, Adobe has added a new skill to its Acrobat AI that tries to interpret complex contracts for the average person.\n\nAutomatically detecting when a PDF is a contract, the AI can summarize the information, suggest questions for you to ask, and even find differences between multiple versions of a contract. To access the new contract-reading superpower, you'll need to purchase Adobe's AI Assistant for Acrobat, a $5 per month add-on for the paid Adobe Acrobat and the free Acrobat Reader.\n\nAlso: Business leaders are embracing AI, but their employees are not so sure\n\nRecognizing regular PDFs and scanned documents set up as contracts, the AI will generate an overview and highlight keywords and terms for you. After analyzing the document, the AI provides a brief summary of the details with cleaner, clearer language and citations. Selecting a specific citation takes you to the source document for review.\n\nThe AI will also help if you have to deal with multiple versions of the same contract. Here, it can scan for differences among them and find inconsistencies and discrepancies across as many as 10 versions. When you're done, you can review the contract with other people and parties involved and request e-signatures directly from Adobe Acrobat or Reader.\n\nYou can use the new skill for a variety of contract types, including credit card and vendor agreements, loyalty programs, purchase orders, and business agreements. For example, a business owner could use the AI to review a partnership agreement with their attorney. A financial analyst can review sales contracts. Consumers could use it to analyze changes in everything from apartment leases to mobile phone plans.\n\nSounds helpful. But what are the potential pitfalls? Well, AI is far from perfect. How do you know that Adobe's AI is analyzing and interpreting the contract correctly?\n\nTo address that question, Adobe says that its AI assistant combines its large language models (LLMs) with the same artificial intelligence and machine learning models behind its Liquid Mode technology. The goal is to offer a more accurate analysis of the document's structure and content to improve the quality and reliability of the output.\n\nAlso: Perplexity lets you try DeepSeek R1 - without the security risk\n\nAI is also infamous for training itself on user data. Will your contracts be on the training list? To address this concern, Adobe says that the AI is governed by data security protocols and developed in line with its AI ethics processes. The company promises that it will never train its generative AI models on customer data and restricts third-party LLMs from similar training.\n\n\"Customers open billions of contracts in Adobe Acrobat each month and AI can be a game changer in helping simplify their experience,\" Abhigyan Modi, senior vice president of Adobe Document Cloud, said in a news release. \"We are introducing new capabilities to deliver contract intelligence in Adobe AI Assistant, making it easier for customers to understand and compare these complex documents and providing citations to help them verify responses, all while keeping their data safe.\"",

Leading this group are five major companies that have been at the forefront of the tech sector economy, driving innovation and shaping consumer behavior. Over the years, Big Tech firms have benefited from the widespread adoption of smartphones and high-speed internet, increased demand for digital services, the rise of social media, strong demand for cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising.\n\nHow Did the Big Tech Companies Become The Giants They are Today?\n\nBeyond technological advancements, these companies have also benefited from several phenomena. The first is network effects\u2014the more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes. Other contributing factors include economies of scale as they expanded through acquisitions and the ease of scaling digital businesses globally; access to vast amounts of user data used to enhance products, target ads, and create highly personalized services; and their deep pockets (strong balance sheets) that enabled them to invest heavily in R&D, hire top talent, and operate during challenging times. This financial strength also allowed them to aggressively invest in AI and maintain a first-mover advantage. While challenges persist, we believe these companies will continue to innovate, expand their influence, and shape the future of technology.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Wedbush Securities\u2019 Global Head of Technology Research, Dan Ives, expressed optimism about the future of Big Tech, stating:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s $80 billion investment announcement and then Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his company plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence is \u201cthe start of a massive build-out of AI Capex\u201d that I think the Street is massively underestimating. And it\u2019s the multiplier \u2013 every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, means $8 to $10 multiplier goes to the rest of tech \u2013 that\u2019s bullish for tech. Of course, with Trump and Stargate, it just shows that fourth industrial revolution is just starting.\u201d\n\nWhile Big Tech typically refers to the top five mega-cap companies, we have prepared an extended list of 15 stocks that have made a significant impact on the tech landscape and are equally innovative and transformative as the top five.\n\nStory Continues",

Nowadays, with subscription models dominating the creative software space, things have gotten a bit more complicated. And while photographers may need a bingo card to know how much Photoshop is going to cost, there are a lot more benefits than swinging down to the local computer store and picking up a copy.\n\n\n\nWith the launch of Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud subscription service in 2013, the industry underwent a sudden shift from buying a new copy every handful of years to get the latest features, to a monthly subscription model with updates coming far more often, and for \u201cfree\u201d (with updates bundled with the recurring cost). This was the promise of Creative Cloud, and Adobe made it easy to subscribe to.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud plans for photographers looking to use Photoshop for photo editing.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe All-You-Can-Eat All Apps Plan\n\nAdobe\u2019s All Apps plan, provides access to over 20 apps in the Adobe Creative Cloud Collection, from Photoshop to Lightroom, from Premiere to After Effects.\n\nFor the average photographer, the All Apps plan can not only be overwhelming, but it\u2019s also likely not as good a value for simply taking stills and post-processing them. However, for a content creator who does it all, this is by far the best value at $54.99 a month for individuals.\n\nBut pricing is a little more complicated than that single monthly rate advertised by Adobe \u2014 it only applies if you choose to subscribe for a whole year with monthly billing.\n\nTo get access at $55 per month, you\u2019ll need to agree to a whole year, which will end up costing $659.88 over that span. If you cancel before that year is up, you\u2019ll be charged an \u201cearly termination fee\u201d just like with annual subscriptions in other industries such as cellular, Internet, and TV.\n\nIf you would rather pay monthly without being locked in for a year, the All Apps plan will cost you $82.49 per month. If, on the other hand, you would like to maximize savings and do not mind paying for a whole year up front, you can pay $599.88 for a year in advance, which comes out to $49.99 per month.\n\nJust to recap, here is a pricing breakdown for the All Apps plan:\n\nMonthly (pay monthly) : $82.49/month\n\n: $82.49/month Yearly (pay monthly) : $54.99/month\n\n: $54.99/month Yearly (pay upfront): $49.99/month\n\nIf you are not subscribing as an individual but as a business, you will be charged a different rate as well. Business subscriptions break down to $84.99 per month per license (regardless of whether you pay monthly or upfront) or $34.99 for the single app subscription per month. The Business Plan also includes 1TB of cloud storage per user, versus 100GB of storage for the individual plan.\n\nAdobe also offers discount rates for students and teachers, with a monthly cost of $19.99 for the all-you-can-eat plan (regardless of if you pay monthly or upfront). The discount is based on a one-year annual rate of $239.88. At the end of that term, the standard subscription renewal rate, currently $359.88/year (or $29.99 per month) is charged unless the service is canceled.\n\nThe Photography Plan(s)\n\nFor the still photographer, the Photography Plan offers Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom for $10 a month (with no annual contract involved). The Photography Plan comes with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and Adobe Lightroom Classic, plus access to mobile versions of both apps, and Adobe Portfolio. Oh, and it comes with 20GB of storage in Adobe\u2019s Cloud.\n\nIn addition to the basic photography plan, there are two other options available to photographers. First, you can upgrade to 1TB of cloud storage by paying $19.99 per month instead of $9.99. If you do not need Photoshop, you can get just Lightroom with 1TB storage for $9.99 per month.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the photography plans:\n\nPhotoshop, Lightroom, 20GB Storage : $9.99/month\n\n: $9.99/month Photoshop, Lightroom, 1TB Storage : $19.99/month\n\n: $19.99/month Lightroom, 1TB Storage: $9.99/month\n\nWhen you consider that the last stand-alone version of Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop CS6, started at $699, it\u2019s easy to see the value when one does the math and realizes that updates will come twice a year at no extra charge.\n\nThe Photography Plan also comes with Adobe Lightroom, making it an even bigger value, even if the photographer isn\u2019t a Lightroom user.\n\nThe Single App Plan for Photoshop\n\nIt may be tempting to just subscribe to the Single App Plan. This article is about Photoshop after all. But Adobe charges $21 a month to subscribe to a single app. That means the photographer is paying $11 more a month for half the functionality if they choose to subscribe only to Photoshop rather than to one of the photography plans. That\u2019s not a good value.\n\nBut what about if you don\u2019t want yet another subscription service dipping into your wallet every month and siphoning off a monthly fee? At this point, you\u2019re out of luck, as Adobe has long fully embraced the subscription model and turned its back on perpetual licenses. If you just do not need Photoshop enough to pay a subscription fee, your best bet may be to use one of the popular Photoshop alternatives on the market, which are generally either free or available with a perpetual license.\n\nAnother Alternative: Photoshop Elements\n\nHowever, if sandboxing is the aim, it is still possible to pick up Adobe Photoshop Elements, which is a stripped-down version of Photoshop. It has about 80% of the features of Photoshop with new features filtering down from Creative Cloud every year. But there are some that are noticeably missing.\n\nPhotoshop Elements cannot export files in CMYK format, thus making print production work an issue. Elements is missing 16-bit and 32-bit image support, or chromatic aberration repair, while Photoshop does. There are also no Lens geometry profiles, Lab, Duotone, or Multi-Channel color modes, and Elements also doesn\u2019t have access to Adobe Bridge, which has several key features including moving files to dedicated folders, opening up other apps to further the processing without closing out, and resizing without losing resolution.\n\nStill, for $99, it\u2019s a bargain for beginning photographers looking to improve raw still images by fixing them in post. But why stop there? For $149, Adobe Premiere Elements can also be picked up as a two-app set, giving the user the ability to edit video as well.\n\nBoth Photoshop in Creative Cloud and Photoshop Elements are powerful tools and if which version to use still isn\u2019t clear, then users can download a 7-day free trial decide.\n\nHow Much is Photoshop\u2019s Early Termination Fee?\n\nIf you do choose to subscribe to a yearly option with monthly billing for either the All Apps plan or Single App plan, you will receive hefty savings over the course of the year, but you will be charged an early cancellation fee if you end up canceling the subscription before the year is up.\n\nIf you cancel within the first 14 days of your first payment, there is no cancellation fee and you will get a full refund. Those first two weeks are considered a trial period in which you can test out the app(s).\n\nOnce that 14-day window is over, however, you will be on the hook for a cancellation fee of 50% of the remaining balance of the contract. What this means is if you agree to subscribe for a year but decide you\u2019d like to stop paying monthly after 3 months, you will still owe Adobe 50% of the remaining 9 months.\n\nHere is a chart that breaks down roughly how much you would need to pay in early termination fees depending on which month of the year you cancel:\n\nIf Adobe offers you a yearly discount on the 20GB Photography plan, here is what the cancellation fee schedule would look like:\n\nUpon cancellation, your Creative Cloud membership will automatically be turned into a free membership and your access to the paid apps will be ended. Your cloud storage limit will be lowered to 2GB, and you will have 30 days to save your excess data from the Adobe Cloud before it is deleted and lost forever.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are a photographer who has been thinking about subscribing to an Adobe Creative Cloud plan so that you can start editing photos in Photoshop, we hope this guide to Photoshop\u2019s current pricing was helpful to you. If you\u2019re still undecided or have concluded that you can\u2019t stomach the cost, you should look into our picks for the best free photo editing apps and free raw photo editors currently available.\n\nImage credits: Stock photos from Depositphotos",

It can recognize contracts in PDFs or scanned documents, then generate overviews that are more digestible. \u201cAcrobat AI Assistant generates summaries and responses with clear language and clickable citations, making it fast and easy to navigate to the source and verify responses,\u201d says the blog post (spotted by The Verge).\n\nOn the face of it, that seems like a good thing. Contracts are long and confusing \u2014 often intentionally so, but sometimes just out of necessity for a complex process. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in needing some help truly understanding even the basic stuff, like a lease or insurance policy.\n\nBut considering the extremely public and widespread issues we\u2019ve encountered with generative AI summaries, I would hesitate to rely on any tool applying that tech to something as important as a legally binding contract. And that\u2019s just a lack of faith in \u201cAI\u201d on my part.\n\nImagine how someone could use this to their advantage, though. Lawyers and other legal writers who do this for a living would be able to spot the patterns in AI-generated summaries almost immediately. With that knowledge in their back pocket, it would be easy to write entirely legal contracts in a way that\u2019s intended to steer AI-generated summaries into showing you false or misleading text.\n\nI can see the hypothetical press release now: \u201cIt\u2019s not my client\u2019s fault if the plaintiff did not read the contract themselves, and reached the wrong conclusion by using software to read it for them.\u201d\n\nSorry, bank manager, but I\u2019m still going to pester you before I initial here, here, and here, and sign here, at least for the foreseeable future.

            "content": "Adobe, which loves to shove long-term subscriptions onto its customers, has a new add-on for Acrobat that it says will make it easier to read and understand legal contracts. Acrobat AI Assistant, as it is called, is supposed to look at a PDF contract and extract the most important details, as well as simplify them in a way that regular people can understand.\n\nThe new feature is built into Adobe\u2019s Acrobat PDF reader, and serves as a $4.99 per month add-on for both free and paid tiers of the app. You can probably expect that Adobe is going to push the feature hard on users as it has reoriented its whole business around recurring subscriptions.\n\nAdobe says that recent surveys found 70 percent of consumers admit to signing contracts without knowing all of the terms within them. That suggests 30 percent of people actually read through contracts in their entirety, which seems generous. Either way, Adobe says that Acrobat AI Assistant can save users time by surfacing key terms with citations, and recommend questions a user might ask the assistant in order to fully understand what they are signing.\n\nOf course, AI language models are not perfect\u2014they are next-word predictors that try and produce text that looks like a factual synthesis of the information they are provided; they do not inherently try and produce a factual synthesis. That could be good enough some of the time, but in the case of legal contracts it opens up users to risk if they sign a contract claiming they understood it when in fact they had not actually read it in its entirety. Generally, pleading ignorance because you did not read it does not make a contract invalid.\n\nThat being said, because most people do not read contracts anyway, it seems like somewhat of a moot point.\n\nMajor companies like to fill their user agreements with complex language that will protect them from liability. Last year, Disney faced a PR crisis when a man whose wife died after eating at a restaurant in Disney World was told he could not sue the company because he had signed a user agreement for Disney+ that required disputes with the company go to private arbitration. Perhaps a tool like Acrobat AI Assistant could at least surface details like that and explain them so individuals understand what they are signing up for.\n\nAdobe has lost a lot of fans over the years due to its move to a subscription model for apps like Photoshop, as well as its use of dark patterns to keep customers locked in by charging them penalties if they try and cancel annual subscriptions early. Tech and entertainment companies prefer subscription models over one-time purchases because they create recurring, predictable revenue streams. Photoshop being the industry standard in the design world, it has been hard to unseat Adobe from its position of dominance.",

            "content": "Microsoft Viva brand expression: How Substance 3D empowers motion designers\n\nWhen Microsoft sought to transform the visual identity of its Viva platform, they turned to 3D motion designer Wes Cockx to design a visual system that would scale from applications to marketing materials. Using Substance 3D tools alongside Maxon's Cinema 4D and Redshift, he developed 40 illustrations and 60 seconds of motion content that bridged Microsoft's existing Fluent Design system with Viva's identity. Below, Wes shares his creative journey to 3D motion design and breaks down the Microsoft Viva project.\n\nI am Wes Cockx, a Creative Director from Brooklyn, New York, specializing in creative design systems and motion design. My work blends color and form, balancing the abstract with realism. I work on projects solo as well as with a small team through my studio CREAM3D.\n\nThe journey to motion graphics\n\nI studied graphic design with a focus on traditional methods, without any 3D or motion. After a few years working in branding, I realized it was not the right fit for me. To explore other creative paths, I started doing illustration work on the side. At the time, my knowledge of CGI was minimal, and I thought it was only being used in films, architecture and video games.\n\nBut when I noticed 3D in advertising and illustrations, everything changed. I quickly became fascinated, and within a couple of years, I had built up enough freelance work to make the shift.\n\nCreative work\n\nI have been fortunate to collaborate with amazing people and organizations across tech, pharmaceuticals, advertising and fashion. Some brands I have worked with include Microsoft, Google, DeepMind, Meta, Apple, Intuit, Kiehl\u2019s, Adobe, Nike and many others.\n\nOne of the aspects I enjoy most about my job is the diverse range of people and teams with whom I collaborate. The opportunity to express my creativity for a living continually amazes me.\n\nWorkflow\n\nEvery project is different, but I usually start with an exploratory phase. I used to sketch, but now, after writing out some key guidelines distilled down from the briefing, I explore a wide range of visuals directly in 3D.\n\nDuring this phase I start experimenting with short motion tests, eventually this leads to establishing a visual concept and language for the project. Exploring a wide range of directions from the start usually helps me and the client to set boundaries and lock down the overall direction of the project.\n\nSubstance 3D\n\nAfter trying Substance 3D Designer, I was immediately convinced of its potential. The learning curve is short, and it allows me to create textures quickly, from subtle imperfections to intricate, model-specific details. Its ability to automatically generate seamless textures and easily iterate on setups has become a crucial part of my workflow.\n\nI primarily use Substance 3D Designer for my work, as it integrates seamlessly with Cinema 4D. However, since I often need to share files with team members or clients, I do not always rely on direct integration. Not everyone has the same version or a license, so for better compatibility and flexibility, I typically export maps and bring them in via texture nodes.\n\nThe Microsoft Viva project\n\nThe Microsoft Viva team contacted me to enhance the visual representation of their platform by harnessing its core attributes. These elements were intended for use across various channels, including the platform itself, the website, applications and marketing communications. In total, we created about 40 still illustrations and 60 seconds of motion.\n\nVisually, the work needed to connect with the Microsoft Fluent Design imagery I created a few years ago. I revisited textures and materials, using the Viva color palette to establish a seamless link to Fluent while ensuring it became uniquely Viva.\n\nThere are around 50 unique materials for this project all made in Substance 3D Designer. An average of an hour per material or less was required. Substance 3D Designer saves me more time and gives me more control to easily create unique details inside the materials.\n\nIn addition to Substance 3D, Cinema 4D and Redshift, I also worked with a range of software, including Houdini, Rizom UV and the Adobe Creative Suite, along with various plugins and custom scripts for each. I managed all modeling, simulations and keyframing in Cinema 4D, where I integrate everything, set up materials and render through Redshift. All compositing is done through Photoshop and After Effects.\n\nCreative approach\n\nOne of my priorities is to keep learning. With new software applications and updates constantly emerging, I enjoy staying current and experimenting with new tools. However, I also strive not to get too caught up in the tools themselves, instead allowing my creativity to take center stage.\n\nI have been improving my ability to explain my ideas and concepts, articulating the thinking and logic behind them. Since English is my second language, this has not always been easy, but I believe it is an often underestimated or overlooked aspect of our work as designers.\n\nI want to thank Adobe and Substance 3D for inviting me to do this.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently analyzed.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took to the airwaves last Friday to discuss the recent stir caused by DeepSeek in the tech world. Cramer highlighted that we\u2019re in the midst of what he described as the most chaotic two weeks of earnings season.\n\nHe noted that last week alone, nearly 20% of S&P 500 companies reported their results, with another quarter of the index set to follow this week. On top of that, Cramer pointed to the selloff in AI stocks sparked by DeepSeek\u2019s revelations, ongoing political turmoil in Washington, and a number of high-profile earnings reports, all of which have made it nearly impossible to keep track of everything happening at once.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks\n\n\u201cWe learned that maybe just maybe we don\u2019t need to buy as many of those chips as we thought a Chinese outfit called DeepSeek has purportedly figured out a way to get much more out of NVIDIA\u2019s cheaper, lower-end chips, which makes you wonder why should anybody buy the most expensive ones?\u201d\n\nCramer noted that, according to DeepSeek, it managed to train an AI model for a mere $6 million, a fraction of the hundreds of millions typically required for such endeavors. DeepSeek\u2019s claim was that their cheaper approach might even result in performance that\u2019s as good, if not better, than what\u2019s possible with the highest-end hardware available.\n\nFor Cramer, this announcement was unsettling. He reflected on how, for a brief moment, the tech world accepted DeepSeek\u2019s bold claim as fact. The consensus seemed to be that DeepSeek, a company backed by a Chinese hedge fund, had effectively disrupted the semiconductor giant\u2019s ability to command high prices for its products. However, Cramer began to question the full accuracy of this narrative. What if DeepSeek wasn\u2019t being entirely transparent about the true cost of its hardware? What if the $6 million figure they reported was far lower than the actual expenses? He explained:\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what an article and a known authority called SemiAnalysis said today. This publication, which has covered DeepSeek for longer than most people knew it existed, speculates that the $6 million cost is highly misleading. They say DeepSeek\u2019s real hardware spending, all in, could be more than $1.6 billion. Hmm, I wonder if the PRC\u2019s subsidizing them.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

The approval of our test for determining HER2-ultralow status offers new hope to patients by providing a possible path to HER2-targeted treatment where none existed before, helping clinicians transform outcomes for many facing this challenging disease.\u201d\n\nThe approval of T-DXd was supported by data from the phase 3 DESTINY-Breast06 trial (NCT04494425), which were presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Findings showed that among the HER2-low population, patients treated with T-DXd (n = 359) experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.2 months compared with 8.1 months for physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (n = 354; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.74; P < .0001).3\n\nAmong the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included patients with HER2-low and HER2-ultralow disease, T-DXd (n = 436) generated a median PFS of 13.2 months vs. 8.1 months for chemotherapy (n = 430; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.75; P < .0001).\n\nIn the HER2-ultralow population, the median PFS was 13.2 months for T-DXd (n = 76) vs 8.3 months for chemotherapy (n = 75; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.21).\n\nThe randomized, multicenter, open-label DESTINY-Breast06 trial enrolled patients with hormone receptor\u2013positive metastatic breast cancer that was HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH negative) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining). Patients were required to be naive to chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. However, patients needed to have at received at least 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy with or without targeted therapy in the metastatic setting; or 1 prior line of endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting with disease progression within 6 months of starting first-line endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or recurrence within 24 months of starting adjuvant endocrine therapy.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to received T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or physician\u2019s choice of chemotherapy comprising capecitabine, nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), or paclitaxel. Stratification factors included prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use (yes vs no), HER2 expression (low vs ultralow), and prior taxane use in the nonmetastatic setting (yes vs no).\n\nPFS per blinded independent central review in the HER2-low population served as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Key secondary end points included PFS and overall survival (OS) in the ITT population; and OS in the HER2-low population. Other secondary end points consisted of overall response rate, duration of response, safety, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nAdditional data showed OS data reached maturity of approximately 40%; in the HER2-low population, the 12-month OS rate was 87.6% with T-DXd vs 81.7% for chemotherapy (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.05; P = .1181). These respective rates were 87.0% and 81.1% in the ITT population (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-1.00). In the HER2-ultrallow population, the 12-month OS rate was 84.0% for T-DXd vs 78.7% for chemotherapy (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43-1.29).\n\nSafety data showed that any-grade treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) occurred in 98.8% of patients treated with T-DXd (n = 434) vs 95.2% of patients given chemotherapy (n = 417). The rates of any-grade treatment-related AEs were 96.1% and 89.4%, respectively. Serious TEAEs were reported in 20.3% and 16.1% of patients, respectively.\n\nIn the T-DXd arm, TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation, dose interruptions, and dose reductions in 14.3%, 48.4%, and 24.7% of patients, respectively. These respective rates were 9.4%, 38.4%, and 38.6%. TEAEs led to death in 2.5% of patients in the experimental arm vs 1.4% of patients in the control arm. TEAEs leading to death were deemed related to treatment in 1.2% of patients in the T-DXd arm vs no patients in the chemotherapy arm.\n\nReferences",

Most of us know the arguments for ditching X, Threads, Facebook and Instagram in 2025. But before you follow the crowd, it's worth taking a step back and thinking: am I going from the frying pan into the fire?\n\nWhich social media platform to choose is something we've been discussing with our community for some time now. And for good reason. Brand strategist Hammad Aslam reflects the feelings of many when he says: \"Social media is like a moving puzzle, and keeping up can feel like a full-time job\"\n\nWe'd love to be able to tell you definitively that there is one particular social platform that's best for creatives. Unfortunately, it's not so simple. The benefits of different platforms will differ for different people and will largely depend on what you want to get from social media.\n\nSo, this article will instead look at how to choose the social media platform that's right for you.\n\nWhat are you using social media for?\n\nThe first step is to consider what you're actually using social media for. This may sound like a daft question, but different people use social media for many different reasons and in vastly different ways.\n\nMost obviously, celebrities use it to promote themselves and their work without having to please gatekeepers or pay for marketing. On the other hand, journalists use it to gather information, quotes and stories.\n\nFor visual creatives, there are a multitude of reasons for using social media: self-promotion, lead generation, networking, gathering tips, inspiration, and information, and feeling like you're part of a community.\n\nAnd, in truth, many of us use it to pass the time, mindlessly scrolling through stuff we're not really interested in, in the same way we might zone out in front of the TV.\n\nWhich of these are most important to you will greatly impact which social network you choose. For example, if you're primarily interested in lead generation and networking, many creatives are making enthusiastic noises about LinkedIn in 2025.\n\nWhy some are switching to LinkedIn\n\nElla Kashirokova, founder and brand designer at Escent Creative, is among them. \"I never thought I'd say this, but LinkedIn is my go-to right now,\" she says. \"It used to be Instagram, but I've definitely seen a shift of more people coming from there onto Linkedin.\"\n\nIt's also become the go-to for brand builder Matt Lewis. \"We're also active on Insta, but our engagement is way less on there,\" he explains. \"In terms of strategies, we're starting to do some active lead\u2013gen work now rather than just posting about our work. It's not something we've really done before because all of our work comes through word of mouth or referral. But we thought it was time to be more proactive.\"\n\nMost of the creatives active on LinkedIn we've spoken to love its business-oriented nature. That means that everyone is generally on best behaviour, and keeps the chat primarily about work topics: you'll be pushed to find trolls or people ranting about politics here.\n\nLinkedIn is a solid choice for creatives. Image: wichayada - stock.adobe.com\n\nBut at the same time, that can make it feel the least, well, \"social\" of the social networks. As designer, photographer and illustrator Ed Clews puts it: \"LinkedIn works best for me in connecting with potential clients, but it's not particularly geared for fun.\"\n\nIllustrator Sretan Bor agrees. \"I've been using LinkedIn more and more, and it's great for connecting,\" he says. \"But I'm still not sure it's good for actually reaching out to people. Maybe that should be reserved just for emails.\"\n\nInstagram vs TikTok\n\nSo, what are the best LinkedIn alternatives today? For the Creative Boom community, Instagram still seems to be the most popular choice despite frustrations with the algorithm and an increasing lack of engagement with posts that aren't paid for or based on video.\n\nSo why aren't we seeing a mass exodus from this platform in the same way that seems to be happening with X? Well, quite simply because Instagram is still very well positioned for portfolio and brand building, allowing you to curate a polished, professional presence online with minimal effort.\n\nNetworking and discovery are made easier through hashtags, collaborations, and Instagram's recommendation engine. Monetisation opportunities exist through Instagram Shops, paid partnerships, and subscriptions. Features like Stories and Reels keep engagement levels high for those who are prepared to make short videos.\n\nIf you are up for video, though, why not try TikTok? Yes, it may end up getting banned in the US, but all the signs are that the politicians and business leaders are doing their best to save it. Even if it is, that will only cause the platform to lose 170 million users out of a total billion, which is still not to be sneezed at.\n\nTikTok is still popular amongst creatives. Image: Shi - stock.adobe.com\n\nThe good thing about TikTok is that the algorithm is designed to push fresh content to a broad audience, regardless of follower count. That means it can be a good place to share authentic, storytelling content, and raw, behind-the-scenes content often performs better than the overly polished visuals favoured on Instagram.\n\nNiche communities flourish here too, making it an ideal space for specific creative interests. And potential monetisation exists through the TikTok Creator Fund, brand partnerships, and live gifting.\n\nThreads vs BlueSky\n\nWhich brings us to Threads and BlueSky. As they were both launched as direct rivals to X, it stands to reason they're best suited for people who've grown disenchanted with the social network previously known as Twitter. But at the moment, they're in a bit of a vicious circle.\n\nWhile many have signed up, there has been little posting and engagement. So, we have a bit of a chicken and egg situation: Many are unwilling to post until more people join, but people are unwilling to join until more people post.\n\nIf you're willing to take the leap, though, which should you opt for? To look at Threads first, Meta's platform seems to be evolving into a more relaxed and discussion-friendly space. And that makes it a good potential choice for creatives looking to have nice online chats without the pressure of maintaining a visually perfect feed.\n\nBluesky, alternative to X. Image: Mojahid Mottakin - stock.adobe.com\n\nLess algorithm interference makes content appear more chronologically, reducing frustration over hidden posts than you find on Instagram. However, Threads doesn't currently make it easy to find people, meaning gaining traction can be slower than on other platforms.\n\nAlso, following owner Mark Zuckerberg's contributions to Trump's campaign and announcement he was scaling back moderation on his social networks, some are turning to BlueSky instead. It does pretty much the same job as Threads, with the big differences that it's not owned by Meta and that (not coincidentally) it currently has a much smaller user base.\n\nBecause Meta can keep feeding Threads with new people via advertising on Instagram and Facebook, BlueSky is likely to forever remain the smaller of the two. Of course, you might see that as a good thing (a more intimate, connected, and passionate community) or a bad thing (less opportunity to reach a mass audience). It's your call, basically.\n\nHow to choose\n\nSo, how do you choose between all these networks? Again, it goes back to what your main goals are. If showcasing work is key, Instagram might be the best fit. If you're willing to make video, TikTok excels at organic engagement and trend-driven content. BlueSky may appeal if meaningful chat is a priority, but Threads' greater audience reach may swing it if you're interested in large follower counts.\n\nThe type of audience you seek also matters: for example, LinkedIn is best for business connections, whereas TikTok fosters entertainment-driven communities. Stability is another factor to weigh; established platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn offer reliability, while emerging ones like Threads and BlueSky present opportunities for early adoption.\n\n\"What I recommend to my clients is to use the platforms they actually like using,\" says brand consultant Craig Gillespie. \"For me, that's primarily Instagram and Linkedin, although it does mean it's easy to overconsume and under-create. The key thing is, though, to move people over to an email list. We don't own these platforms, so any changes can massively impact businesses.\"\n\nHow not to choose\n\nOf course, you don't actually have to choose between platforms at all: you could use all of them if you want. That's what designer Tom Muller does.\n\n\"I don't believe in restricting yourself into social echo chambers or bubbles, so I'm still active on all main social networks,\" he explains. \"You go where your audience is. I'm still on X, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, Tumblr, BlueSky and LinkedIn. I've built up a good number of followers across these platforms over the years, and I've noticed that over time, engagement will ebb and flow between them, but each\u2014for me at least\u2014caters to a different audience, with some overlap, that brings visibility to my work and my studio, often resulting in new clients and projects. The platforms are bigger than just the people at the top.\"\n\nMost of us, though, have found that trying to do too much leads to burnout and have taken action accordingly. Take Ben Mottershead, founder and strategy director at Never Dull. \"I've ditched Meta, use TikTok for news, and have decreased my time on Linkedin by about 60% since the summer of last year,\" he says. \"Overall, my stress has decreased notably, and I definitely feel more balanced with my outlook on everything.\"\n\nIndeed, maybe it matters less which social media platform you use and more what you do with it. As Cher Keane, associate director at Red Setter, says: \"Irrespective of the platform, real people want to know they're connecting with real people more than ever.\n\n\"My best advice is be you. Spelling mistakes are OK, swear if you swear, stop writing lofty posts that don't actually say anything, talk about stuff you actually give a damn about, and engage with other people to actually engage with them, not because it'll help boost your content. It's really obvious when someone is writing a post for the sake of being visible and to satisfy algorithms rather than genuinely seeking to start a conversation, and it's utterly boring. Be a human.\"\n\nAn alternative if social media just isn't cutting it anymore\n\nIf all of this sounds exhausting, you're not alone. Social media can feel like a never-ending cycle of algorithm shifts, declining engagement, and the pressure to constantly create. That's why we launched The Studio, Creative Boom's private community for creatives looking for something different.\n\nIt's a dedicated space away from the noise, where designers, illustrators, photographers, and other creative professionals can connect, collaborate, and support each other without the distractions of traditional social platforms.\n\nWith industry discussions, portfolio feedback, job opportunities, and live events, it's designed to foster genuine connections without the hassle of chasing likes or playing the algorithm game.

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Adobe Stock\n\nThe news has highlighted the most egregious cases of fraud that were committed during the pandemic, in particular with regard to the Paycheck Protection Program \u2014 better known as PPP. However, the federal government is not only aggressively investigating these extreme criminal cases but also focusing on many other pandemic-era loans, whether forgiven or not. Considering the government could potentially recover three times the amount of the loan, plus interest and penalties that alone may exceed the loan itself.\n\nIf you receive an investigation notice, you should contact legal counsel.\n\nYou will be notified of an investigation in writing \u2014 not via telephone, text, or email. Unscrupulous people utilized the pandemic to commit fraud, and they continue to do so with threats of arrest and prosecution for nonrepayment of pandemic era loans.\n\nYour attorney will confirm whether the investigation is legitimate or not. Do not assume the \u201cinvestigation is fraudulent\u201d and can be ignored, even if a governmental email address or telephone number is incorrect.\n\nMost investigative notices require a response within 20 days, and by statute, responding is mandatory. As a result, once your attorney has confirmed the investigation notice is legitimate, an extension to respond should be requested, which is usually granted. Then make sure your leadership team and counsel are in lockstep. Your attorney should be familiar with the production of documents in federal investigations or federal courts, considering the likely voluminous nature of the documents that will need to be electronically searched and reviewed to fully respond to the requests.\n\nWhile your lender may tangentially be involved, your internal bookkeeper and your accountant will be crucial to proving financial responses to the government. For example, the initial PPP loan only required your business to have a legitimate concern due to economic uncertainty, but the second PPP loan required an actual financial loss. Additionally, your internal nonfinancial recordkeeping will be significant. You may be asked to produce internal texts, emails, and other contemporaneous documentation reflecting your business situation at the time of your loan application. Also, if your IT is not handled internally, you will likely need to contract with third parties to search and download emails and texts into a searchable form.\n\nOnce all of the potential responsive documents have been located, they should be uploaded to a searchable database so your attorney can determine which documents are responsive to which requests by searching key words. Once the responsive documents have been coded to each corresponding request, they can then be transferred to the government via a link database. The investigator may have additional unanswered questions, which you may or may not be able to answer or provide responsive documents. However, even if that is the case, if you have good recordkeeping policies and are diligent in your responses, the investigation, while likely expensive, should be resolved uneventfully.\n\nWhile you are unlikely to ever receive formal notice that the investigation is closed or not being pursued further, in our experience these pre-investigation requests are not an after-the-fact claw back. Instead, they are legitimate investigations by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to root out fraud.\n\nPrichard Bevis represents businesses of all sizes and structures from the formation of business entities, operations, expansion, sale, and dissolution.

Anyone who views or downloads images with this setting enabled can verify their digital history via Adobe\u2019s Content Authenticity web tool or its Chrome browser extension.\n\nThe Content Credentials system is based on open-source technical standards developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). The idea is not only to make it easier for artists and photographers to retain attribution for their work, but also to help people confidently distinguish authentic images and videos from those that have been altered or generated using AI tools.

Today, a Creative Cloud subscription costs between $9.99 per month for a single app to $59.99 per month for full access to the suite. That adds up to quite a lot over the course of a year, especially when you need to buy a laptop for graphic design as well.\n\nExpensive Adobe software can certainly feel like the gatekeeper of legitimate digital art.

A labor of love, it\u2019s a free pro-grade toolset that\u2019s community-built and maintained, and it\u2019s as strong of a pick for photo manipulation as it is for image creation.\n\nGimp\u2019s built-in capabilities include familiar tools like clone stamp, paint bucket, transforms, and various selection tools.

(Here are the links to Windows , Linux , and Mac ; use at your own risk.)\n\nIf you\u2019re newly switching from Photoshop, Gimp\u2019s interface will take some commitment to learn. A Gimp session that\u2019s been updated with plugins will do most of what you\u2019d traditionally expect from Photoshop, but it isn\u2019t laid out the same.\n\nUse it for digital image creation, processing, and retouching photos before they go online. If you work with still images of any type, Gimp is a program you should have in your toolbar.\n\nI bought my laptop for Photoshop , but I\u2019ve had Gimp in my taskbar for longer. I use it whenever I need to crop a photo, tweak a color, or touch up a detail before posting online.\n\nGet Gimp\n\nInkscape: A vector editor for daily tasks\n\nI used Inkscape to take a simple raster sketch and turn it into a favicon for my personal website. (Image credit: Future/Gabriel Morgan)\n\nFirst released in 2003, this vector art software has been updated continuously and still thrives on multiple platforms today.\n\nVector art is rarely as intuitive as raster software, which often feels like painting with digital watercolor. Vector software is something altogether different and provides maximum control over solid, scalable graphics. It primarily deals in flat colors and gradients.\n\nDownload Inkscape to design website favicons, create a brand logo that can scale to the size of a billboard, and build cartoon artwork.\n\nI love Inkscape\u2019s built-in tools for bitmap conversion. I\u2019ve used the software to turn digital raster sketches into crisp logos. I used it to create the favicon for my website . To do so, simply drop a digital drawing into the software, then use the \u201ctrace bitmap\u201d function.\n\nThe program will turn your linework into a digital path that can be micro-adjusted using the software\u2019s path editing tools.\n\nGet Inkscape\n\nScribus: Layout a magazine with an open-source app\n\nScribus follows the same ethos as Gimp and Inkscape, and it\u2019s designed to play well with both programs. It\u2019s a surprisingly powerful alternative to Adobe\u2019s InDesign that\u2019s completely free and open-source.\n\nScribus is the freebie option when you\u2019re looking to create an art book, design menus for a local restaurant, or print your own business cards.\n\nIn Scribus, you\u2019ll be able to use familiar concepts like grids, guides, and frames in much the same way that you would in Indesign. Set guides and grids to create precise layouts that can be applied across an entire book or magazine, then populate your frames with imagery.\n\nGet Scribus\n\nBlender: Build complex 3D worlds, animate them, and more\n\n(Image credit: Future/Gabriel Morgan)\n\nBlender is the classic open-source option for 3D modeling, motion graphics, and beyond \u2014 and it needs to be on your radar. However, Blender is far from intuitive.\n\nInstead of gaining any real proficiency, the hours I put into Blender only served to clarify just how wide the program is in scope. Thankfully, a vast community of dedicated users has made all the content you could need to help steer you in the right direction.\n\nGet Blender\n\nCanva Free: Make simple graphics for the web\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent much time in a corporate environment, you\u2019ve probably encountered Canva . Native to browsers, Canva is free to get started with, though many of its more powerful tools, like its background remover, are locked behind a $120 per-year paywall.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve heard professional designer friends gripe about Canva, there\u2019s no arguing with its usefulness. When you want to build a simple graphic or format an image for your CMS, Canva Free edition gets the job done quickly \u2026 much of the time.\n\nTry Canva\n\nRemove.bg: Get rid of image backgrounds for free\n\nWhat\u2019s the big thing missing from the free edition of Canva? Well, there\u2019s a lot, but I miss the background remover most often. Thankfully, there\u2019s a simple free service for doing just that. Remove.bg is a website that does one thing \u2014 it accepts digital images and sends them back without a background, and it\u2019s really good at it, too.\n\nI use Remove.bg weekly. In fast-paced media environments, where a hero or header image often needs to get built in minutes, Remove.bg enables you to grab a photo, remove the background, then send it on to Canva Free, where you can add it into a photo collage, position it, and then run it on your site.\n\nOne thing to note: Remove.bg\u2019s free version only supplies low-resolution images. You\u2019ll need to make an account if you want high-definition images.\n\nTry Remove.bg\n\nOne-time fee art software\n\nProcreate: A beautiful digital painting suite\n\nProcreate provides the most appealing digital painting experience I\u2019ve encountered. (Image credit: Future/Gabriel Morgan)\n\nIf you\u2019re a digital artist, chances are you\u2019ve been hearing about Procreate for years. The iPad native art app is one of the best art tools I\u2019ve encountered. Running on my 2020 iPad Air, Procreate provides a delicious digital art set that handles drawing as wondrously as it does liquid raster brushes.\n\nI\u2019ve tested industry-leading graphics tablets with Photoshop, and I\u2019ve never yet found a setup for digital illustration that beats the experience of Procreate on iPad.\n\nIf you\u2019re working with specific color grading or technical illustration for billboards, the specificity that can come from running Photoshop on a premium machine is unreachable on an iPad. However, for most of us, Procreate is more than powerful enough.\n\nIn 2025, Procreate is available for a one-time fee of $12.99. For the money, it\u2019s incredible value. When you need more tools, the internet is happy to help with endless libraries of custom brushes for purchase or download. There\u2019s also just as much learning material out there to help you get started.\n\nThe one caveat: You need an iPad .\n\nIf you\u2019re new to digital art and trying to decide whether you want to buy a laptop or an iPad, there\u2019s a real argument to be made for choosing Procreate on iPad. I know many professional illustrators who work exclusively in a Procreate environment. For digital illustrators, I think it\u2019s usually the better choice.\n\nGet Procreate\n\nAffinity: The single-fee Adobe competitor\n\nThe Affinity Suite contains three software packages that fill the roles of the three Adobe apps most designers use. Affinity Designer, Affinity Publisher, and Affinity Photo provide a well-rounded set of digital art tools that can be further expanded with add-ons.\n\nEach Affinity program costs $69.99 individually. This one-time fee grants you indefinite use of the software. The whole suite can also be bought for a lump sum of $164.99. Thankfully, free seven-day trials allow you to try the software without committing.\n\nFull disclosure: I don\u2019t use Affinity myself, but I\u2019m eyeing it. If you\u2019re committing to a career in the arts and want to learn powerful software with a polished touch, an Affinity license is an excellent buy that can fully replace the need for a monthly Adobe subscription.\n\nGet Affinity\n\nWhen to go Adobe\n\nAdobe makes powerful tools \u2014 no doubt about it. When I partnered with a publisher to design my first poetry and art book, I got a copy of InDesign and used that to collaborate on page layouts. I\u2019ve also gone back to Photoshop for large design projects. Adobe Creative Cloud is often the standard for collaborative art and design work, and working within it simplifies file exchange.\n\nHowever, the rest of the time, I get by with Procreate, Gimp, Inkscape, and the rest of the tools mentioned above. Buying a computer for graphic design is an investment in its own right, so why not use open-source and free tools where you can?\n\nGet the Adobe Creative Cloud\n\nOpen-source art software thrives on donations\n\nIf you find yourself using and loving the open-source software we\u2019ve recommended, we suggest you donate. Open-source software might be free, but it isn\u2019t free to make. Programmers have spent countless hours developing these software suites.",

            "content": "The Organization Donated Millions\n\nComplainants Criticize the Finding\n\nOpening the Door\n\nAfter more than two years, California\u2019s political ethics watchdog has closed its investigation into a controversial campaign donor network , concluding that the group followed legal advice from the state and therefore did not violate contribution limits.The decision clears the way for a bold new approach to raising and spending money in California elections. Political committees now have state regulators\u2019 blessing to create an unlimited number of affiliated committees with different leaders, and then closely coordinate fundraising and candidate donations among them. That could exponentially increase their influence on campaigns.Govern For California \u2014 a 16-chapter nonprofit that aims to counter the influence of organized labor at the state Capitol and which aggressively backed the rise of Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas \u2014 declared \u201cvindication\u201d to its supporters.But the extent of the Fair Political Practice Commission\u2019s probe over the past two years remains unclear. In a one-paragraph \u201cno action closure letter\u201d dated Monday, assistant enforcement chief Angela Brereton cited a 2020 advice letter to clear Govern For California of any wrongdoing.\u201cAfter our investigation and review of the evidence, the Enforcement Division has found that Govern For California has followed the advice given to it by the Commission,\u201d Brereton wrote. \u201cTherefore, we are closing this matter without further action because the allegations have been disproven.\u201dBrereton did not return a message seeking clarification. Shery Yang, a spokesperson for the commission, said in an email that the enforcement team \u201cobtained and reviewed voluminous evidence to make its conclusion,\u201d but did not answer follow-up questions about what the evidence entailed. She also declined to provide a copy of the investigative report.Govern for California founder David Crane, a Stanford University lecturer and former economic adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, also did not respond to an interview request.\u201cWe\u2019re happy the matter is closed, though not that we were dragged through the mud and had to spend time, energy and money defending against a politically-inspired action,\u201d he wrote in a message to his group\u2019s mailing list. \u201cBut we are aware that this is the sort of thing that happens to people who challenge the status quo in Sacramento.\u201dA CalMatters report in 2022 explored Govern For California\u2019s growing prominence in state politics as Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, made his move to take control of Assembly leadership. That election cycle, the organization donated millions of dollars to dozens of legislative candidates; most of the money came from a small group of Bay Area venture capitalists, tech executives and philanthropists who maxed out to each chapter in its statewide network.Several campaign finance experts told CalMatters that the structure of the chapters \u2014 which consult with Crane, receive a majority of their funding funneled through a central committee and regularly make identically sized donations to the same candidates on the same days, using the same treasurer and law firm \u2014 pushes the boundaries of state law by potentially enabling donors to circumvent contribution limits.Crane denied that characterization and compared his organization to unions and their local affiliates. But unions differ from Govern From California in some critical ways, including their broad membership of workers, who contribute small amounts to campaign spending through their dues, and their non-political functions such as collective bargaining.Following the publication of the story, a former labor union leader filed a complaint against Govern For California with the Fair Political Practices Commission. The commission\u2019s enforcement division quickly rejected that complaint , citing its 2020 letter that advised: \u201cProvided the GFC Statewide Committee and all local chapters are controlled by different individuals, who independently direct and control the entities\u2019 respective contributions, the contributions from GFC Statewide Committee and each local chapter do not share contribution limits.\u201dYet Richard Miadich, then-chairperson of the commission, told CalMatters at the time that he would seek to develop new regulations more clearly defining coordination among affiliated campaign committees. He said he had questions about the independence of Govern For California\u2019s chapters, which he said were \u201cplaying very close to the line.\u201d The enforcement division subsequently reversed course and opened an inquiry because \u201cfurther review of the relationship between the GFC and its chapters is warranted.\u201dMiadich has since left the Fair Political Practices Commission. He was replaced last year by Adam Silver, the former chief counsel for the Assembly\u2019s legislative ethics committee. Miadich did not respond to several messages seeking to discuss the conclusion of the Govern For California investigation, and Silver declined to answer questions.\u201cIn lockstep with former FPPC Chairs,\u201d Silver said in a statement, \u201cI have directed our Enforcement Division to focus its resources on investigating and prosecuting, where appropriate, the most serious violations of the law, including campaign money laundering, which was alleged in the Govern for California matter. I have full confidence that the Enforcement Division conducted a thorough investigation and arrived at the correct resolution.\u201dDave Low, the former union leader who filed the complaint, criticized the commission\u2019s conclusion as \u201cweak.\u201d He told CalMatters that the enforcement division appeared to have decided that, because of its previous advice letter, Govern For California\u2019s actions were permissible, without digging deeper into whether the group was actually following that advice.Low said evidence he presented to the commission included an audio recording of Crane, who is president of Govern For California and also co-chair of its statewide chapter, discussing the governance structure of his organization at an event. Excerpts from that recording \u2014 where Crane told the crowd that \u201cwe raise their money for them\u201d and if the chapters supported a particular candidate that Govern For California\u2019s leadership did not, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to raise money for them next year\u201d \u2014 circulated online in 2022.\u201cThe chapters know everything we\u2019re doing\u2026\u201d Crane said on the recording, in response to a question about how Govern for California chooses its top priorities, \u201cand if you don\u2019t like that, you can start your own organization.\u201dLow said he believed the Fair Political Practices Commission had no interest in reconsidering its analysis because it would have made them look bad. \u201cIf they would have looked into the evidence we sent them, they would have come to a different conclusion,\u201d he said.Yang would not confirm whether the commission had authenticated or reviewed the audio recording as part of its investigation.Campaign finance experts told CalMatters that the stamp of approval from state regulators could open the door for other donor networks with a similar structure to emerge.\u201cI can imagine other groups being interested in this group\u2019s innovation,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, though he added that the degree of coordination and independence would likely be closely scrutinized in future iterations. \u201cI don\u2019t think this amounts to a blank check for other committees to set up affiliated groups to evade contribution limits within existing campaign finance laws.\u201dAnn Ravel, a former head of the Fair Political Practices Commission and its federal counterpart, the Federal Elections Commission, told CalMatters in 2022 that she considered Govern For California\u2019s structure \u201cundemocratic\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the spirit\u201d of contribution limits, but not illegal. She said this week that she believed the commission had come to the correct conclusion.But she also called the decision letter \u201ckind of namby-pamby, without any deep explanation\u201d and said it lacked the clarity that should have been provided by an investigation, especially one that took more than two years.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it took so long, and I do think it\u2019s a detriment to the public,\u201d said Ravel, who received $25,700 from the Govern For California network when she ran for state Senate in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to be accused of things and for there not to be an outcome\u201d for such a long time.",

The paid options she looks at are Capture One Pro, Luminar Neo and ON1 Photo Raw.\n\nThe video reminded me that Canon users also have access to decent editing software in the form of Digital Photo Professional (you can select your camera and operating system at this link and download the right version for you). It might be worth checking your camera manufacturer's website, where you may find that a native raw editor specifically for your camera might do better than Adobe. Years ago, when I used Canon's software, while it took a little more work than Adobe Photoshop, I was able to eke out ever-so-slightly better raw conversions from it.\n\nThat said, in the event I need free photo editing software, as I have a few computers and only so many Adobe licenses, I turn to Affinity Photo, now on version 2, for $70. The $50 I paid for version 1 lasted for several years and many versions, so by all accounts, it's an excellent value proposition for what is a very good piece of editing and raw development software.\n\nIn any case, check out Lowrey's takes on free photo editing software, and if you have go-to piece of software that you like to use that isn't on this list, leave it in the comments below.",

            "content": "Adobe faces competition from subscription-free apps and AI image generators, but it always seems to have something up its sleeve to stay on top. The creative tech giant has been adding a slew of AI-powered tools to its legacy programs, from Photoshop to Premiere Pro, but gen AI is now being put at the centre of an entirely new product, Project Concept.\n\nFirst announced at Adobe MAX in October, Adobe Project Concept is a browser-based mood-boarding tool that provides a flexible infinite canvas for ideation. I was given a demonstration this week as the program enters private beta. And what I can say it that it should make it easier to get the ideas in your head onto a screen.\n\nThe Remix tool in Project Concept uses AI to combine the characteristics of two or more images (Image credit: Adobe)\n\nDanielle Morimoto, Group Design Manager for Generative AI with Adobe's Machine Intelligence and New Technologies team, showed me examples of how mood boards can be built in the web app by mixing original assets, free Adobe Content and AI image generation as desired. You can drag and drop images where you want, rearrange them and then edit them or remix them using generative AI all in the same platform.\n\nAs an example, Danielle demoed the creation of a series of moodboards for cover art, each with a different theme and colour palette. She showed how you can pull in some original imagery and then use the AI remixing tool to apply texture or colour from another reference to make the source image fit the look you're after. You can also generate AI images from scratch or combine aspects from various references.\n\nWhile the idea of Concept isn't totally novel, Adobe has what I think are a couple of technological firsts. We've seen style and character reference tags added in other AI image generators to give more control over output, but Concept is going super granular, and making the process more gestural rather than text-based.\n\nAn eyedropper tool allows you to pick characteristics like shape, texture and atmosphere from a source image and combine them with a text prompt to influence the output when you click 'generate', much like the eyedropper in Photoshop, but for more than just colour. In the demo, the eyedropper identified \u201cconcentric spirals\u201d as one salient feature in the background of a source image, and the AI applied a similar pattern to the output.\n\nThis solves a common problem where you might have a reference image with the right composition but the wrong tones or textures. You can find an image with the colours or patterns you want to use and apply those the other reference so that everything fits.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

If you have several image references that you want to combine, instead of trying to describe that combination, you can simply select the images, and the program will write a prompt combining their characteristics, which you can tweak as needed.\n\nOther useful features include the ability to review generation history, and the flexible drag and drop interface looks very liberating. If you drag a series of images to an area of the canvas, you can choose if you want them to be placed horizontally or vertically rather than just plonked anywhere.\n\nCreatives testing the Project Concept have used it to design prototypes for physical products (Image credit: Adobe / Cicy Zhu)\n\nI'm still not convinced about using AI for finished assets. For me, the biggest potential remains for ideation, but most of the tools available so far aren't built for that purpose. Project Concept is the most convincing use case I've seen yet, showing real potential to streamline the proof of concept stage for creatives \u2013 after the initial idea but before work on the final product.\n\nI like how the non-linear flexibility recognises the sometimes messy play and iteration in the creative process. As a mood-boarding tool, it could serve for pretty much anything from photography to branding and product design and savie hours of time scouring the web for the right references. But it could also be useful for artists working in physical mediums before prototyping.\n\nI can't see Project Concept providing enough control to use for the entire production process myself, but there's already integration with Photoshop and integrations with more Adobe apps are coming. That said, I'm suresome designers will be happy working entirely in Concept to create finished pieces for things like social media posts\n\nAt the moment, Concept only supports still images, but the idea is to make it multimedia, and that's when it could really come into its own. Allowing video and motion references to be combined with photos, sketches and colour swatches all in the same place would reflect the more cross-discipline approach that many creative teams now work in. It's really for the creatives testing the product to work out the many different ways it could be used.\n\nYou can learn more and sign up for the waiting list at Adobe. It's not yet been announced whether Project Concept will be added to the standard Adobe Creative Cloud All-Apps suite of applications or if it will be available as a standalone tool.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently looked at.\n\nOn Mad Money, Jim Cramer recently delved into the impact of previous President Joe Biden\u2019s policies on the stock market, raising a question that has been on the minds of many executives: Did the market perform well because of the administration, or in spite of it?\n\nAccording to Cramer, one clear example of success despite the prior president\u2019s policies can be seen in the oil sector. He pointed out that oil performed well even though Biden, who was vocal about his opposition to fossil fuels, is not a supporter of traditional energy sources.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Praised These 6 Companies\u2019 Exceptional Management and Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Rounds: 9 Stocks in Focus\n\nCramer remarked that he himself had pushed back on the notion that the oil industry was doing poorly under Biden when speaking with oil executives. He noted that while the stocks of these companies had done reasonably well, the underlying issue was that there had been no meaningful communication between the president and fossil fuel industry leaders.\n\nCramer explained that Biden, who was a staunch advocate for renewable energy, essentially ignored dialogue with the oil sector, leaving executives without a chance to discuss their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe oil company CEOs that I know wanted to plead their case, play ball, but they never got a chance. Instead, they got a kick in the teeth though almost one year ago when the president crushed the most viable portion of the complex, the liquified natural gas market, by putting a pause on new export decisions pending environmental review.\u201d\n\nCramer also pointed to another major sector that saw gains in spite of the president\u2019s policies: the banking industry. He shared that during his conversations with various bank CEOs, many of them took the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration, especially in terms of its tone and approach. While the banks performed well under Biden, Cramer noted that much of this success was despite the administration\u2019s handling of financial regulations.\n\nHe explained that the lack of communication between the government and the business world had created an environment where many companies were hesitant to pursue mergers and acquisitions, which would have been profitable for shareholders. Instead of fostering productive discussions, the administration\u2019s approach seemed to be to litigate first, without ever attempting to engage in meaningful dialogue. Cramer added:\n\n\u201cIt had a very successful chilling effect on doing new deals, many of which would\u2019ve made shareholders like you a great deal of money\u2026 The bankers wanted some degree of transparency about the new regulations that intruded endlessly on what they were doing. They wanted some sense of the real capital levels that the government wanted to see and they wanted a seat at the table when the president discussed business. Didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on January 17. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer said to buy Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as the stock has come down significantly.\n\n\u201cAdobe, okay. Now, I think Adobe has come so far down that it\u2019s just, I think I\u2019m gonna call it a buy. I may look back, I may be criticized, people may think, what the hell is he talking about? But Adobe\u2026 I want to own some Adobe.\u201d\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading software company recognized for its diverse offerings, especially in the areas of digital media creation and document management. In December 2024, Cramer commented:\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned earlier, the enterprise software stocks have been roaring, reacting very positively to pretty much everything these days. So maybe we should start thinking about buying the stock of Adobe, which has some of the very best software to help businesses with marketing and web design. I like this company very much, but it\u2019s been stuck in enterprise software purgatory. Not anymore. Maybe it has a real run by just delivering good numbers.\u201d\n\nOverall ADBE ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently looked at. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Publishers provide them with ARC e-books and audiobooks in exchange for reviews that can be used for marketing purposes. For a long time, Netgalley used Adobe Digital Editions as a form of Digital Rights Management (DRM). However, they just announced that they no longer use it and switched to LCPL protection.\n\nAs part of ongoing security efforts, NetGalley has also adjusted the \u201cDownload\u201d Reading Option, replacing the older Adobe DRM with EDRLab\u2019s Readium Licensed Content Protection (LCP). NetGalley files have been protected with LCP in the NetGalley Shelf app since it was launched in 2020, but with this upgrade, NetGalley members can now download and read files on any LCP-supported device or app.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to making books easily and securely accessible to NetGalley members. However, they like to read,\u201d said Firebrand Technologies and NetGalley, LLC Chief Technology Officer Tom Shawver. \u201cThis major upgrade expands our Reading Options to allow for a seamless in-browser reading experience while strengthening our partnership with EDRLab to offer portable, Readium LCP-protected downloads. We\u2019re thrilled to pull from our extensive experience to create a simple and convenient reading platform for our community and a first-of-its-kind content protection solution for our publishers.\u201d\n\nOne of LCP\u2019s shortcomings is that it is incompatible with Kobo e-readers, so users can no longer load e-books. Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn said, \u201cThey decided to sunset Adobe DRM in favor of LCP (an excellent open standard). We don\u2019t have support for it yet. Working on it, but it\u2019s backed up behind some other big projects.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichael Kozlowski Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

Register now to save 20% on your pass .\n\nBrands are under pressure to produce more relevant content, faster, across more platforms. To meet that demand, Dentsu and Adobe are rolling out Adobe GenStudio Dentsu+, an AI tool designed to help brands scale content production without ballooning costs.\n\nLaunched last year, GenStudio integrates applications from Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Firefly\u2019s AI models into a single platform. Dentsu is layering its proprietary tools\u2014Merkury (identity and audience insights), and generative AI performance marketing tool GIA\u2014onto Adobe\u2019s content supply chain suite, GenStudio, to automate the process. It\u2019s also layering sustainability tracking capabilities and more through its production arm Tag. So far, Adobe, which named Dentsu Creative its global scaled creative and content AOR in October, is the first client to use the studio.\n\nBrands want to create highly relevant content with more variations, all tied to analytics to measure performance to understand how content is performing\u2014all this while keeping AI brand safety concerns and content governance in mind, according to Abbey Klaassen, global brand president, Dentsu Creative & CEO, Dentsu Creative U.S.\n\n\u201cDoing all this in the old school way is a huge cost and slows the speed to market,\u201d Klaassen told ADWEEK. For example, a global camping equipment brand with five products running 12 campaigns a year across 10 channels and 50 global markets needs 600,000 assets annually.\n\nThe collaboration is not based on revenue-sharing, but rather a strategic partnership, according to Klaassen.\n\nThe Dentsu-Adobe tie-up is the latest example of how holding companies are striking partnerships with companies providing AI solutions, highlighting the growing reliance on AI in advertising. However, as brands turn to gen AI for ad creation, they face the challenge of sameness\u2014content spewed from AI tools tends to look alike\u2014risking a lack of differentiation in a crowded space.\n\nThe new solution uses Merkury to gain customer insights and audience behavior based on brand KPIs\u2014understanding what resonates with target groups and what drives their attention. These insights inform the creative brief, ad, and content creation process, enhanced by Adobe\u2019s tech stack.\n\nAs Klaassen puts it, \u201cIt unlocks the ability to produce content that has the right intent, at scale, efficiently, and effectively.\u201d\n\nDentsu, citing growing client concerns looking to modernize their content supply chain, pitched the idea to Adobe and the two have been working on this solution since December. 80% of clients are having conversations with Dentsu about how to integrate data and insights into the content production process for faster and smarter activations, according to Klaassen.\n\n\u201cCombining GenStudio with Dentsu\u2019s audience intelligence and consultancy, we have the opportunity to activate generative AI for different teams, reshape longstanding workflows around content production, and deliver on-brand performance at scale,\u201d said Brent Rudewick, vice president, Adobe GenStudio and Workfront, Adobe.\n\nSeparate from Adobe\u2019s licensing fee, Dentsu is charging clients a dynamic fee for GenStudio denstu+, based on consultation with Dentsu, implementation, and agency services.\n\n\u201cClients almost don\u2019t have a choice\u2014they have to modernize their content supply chain, or they\u2019ll be left behind,\u201d Klaassen said.\n\nThe article has been updated to reflect that TAG is Dentsu\u2019s production arm, and that Adobe was the first brand to test the studio. It has also been updated to reflect that Adobe is a company providing AI solutions, and that 80% of clients discuss integrating data into content production.",

            "content": "Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock is currently undervalued, and investors who buy it now could achieve a 25% compound annual growth rate in price over the next two years, based on my valuation model. In addition, the margin of safety for investment appears to be around 17%. Not only does Adobe offer a strong two-year value trade, the investment is supported by a robust operational profile. The company has a high chance of enduring growth, supporting returns even in the case of lower market sentiment on the stock remaining constant throughout the two-year period in my model.\n\nOperations & financials\n\nFirstly, we should assess the opportunity at hand here. Adobes stock price declined significantly recently as the companys guidance for Fiscal 2025 fell below market expectations. The company projected annual revenue of between $23.30 billion and $23.55 billion, compared to analysts estimates of $23.78 billion. This near-term moderation in the growth outlook has been a significant factor in opening up what I consider a great value opportunity for investors.\n\nAdobe: A Buying Opportunity on Valuation Weakness\n\nIn addition, several investment banks have lowered their price targets, including Deutsche Bank (DB) and UBS (UBS). This has been the result of concerns of competition in key markets reducing overall growth from AI initiatives. However, it appears expectations were too lofty to begin with, rather than Adobes operational strength and growth horizon being notably weak. As such, I think negative sentiment at the moment is overblown.\n\nThe company has a dominant position in the creative and document software markets. It potentially has around an 80% market share in creative software based on my research, which is particularly remarkable. This is supported by world-class design software, including flagship products like Photoshop, Adobe Express, Illustrator, After Effects, and Lightroom.\n\nThough growth may be slower in the next few years than many analysts initially expected, I believe it is safe to assert that growth will indeed continue. This is the key point, and any moderation in the companys valuation multiples will likely be offset significantly by this growth in the next 18 months or so.\n\nIn addition, while there have been concerns with how much Adobe Firefly (the companys family of generative AI models) will drive growth within the company, it will certainly provide customer retention benefits for those already using the platform, and I believe likely continue to sustain growth through word of mouth and opening up a new audience of designers that can rely on automated software rather than innate technical skill.\n\nStory Continues",

Belsky initially joined Adobe when it acquired the Behance artist portfolio platform for $150 million in 2012.\n\nFollowing a brief departure in 2016, he rejoined Adobe in 2017 to lead its product development across Creative Cloud and has since become one of the design software giant\u2019s most respected and recognizable figures. Belsky played a key role in launching Adobe\u2019s lineup of Firefly generative AI products, which debuted its first AI video model in October last year.\n\nBelsky was also a driving force behind Adobe\u2019s failed attempt to acquire rival product design platform Figma for $20 billion in 2023. The merger agreement was squashed under pressure from UK and EU regulators, requiring Adobe to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee.\n\n\u201cAfter 7 years since returning to Adobe\u2026 i\u2019ll be shifting gears over the coming months + jumping into the fast-evolving world of filmmaking and storytelling (a longtime passion),\u201d Belsky said in his farewell message. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to leave a team, mission, and customer base I care for deeply, but the Adobe team, strategy, and pipeline has never been stronger.\u201d\n\nBelsky says he will be relocating to New York City and will remain in the \u201cextended family of Adobe\u201d as a \u201cfuture tech partner.\u201d According to Adobe chief marketing officer Lara Balazs, Belsky\u2019s A24 partner role will see him building \u201ctools and resources\u201d to help support filmmakers\u2019 creative visions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see how his experience developing technology will translate to the entertainment industry,\u201d Balazs said on Adobe\u2019s blog. \u201cWe have always partnered with studios around the world, and we have already begun conversations with Scott and A24 on how the two companies can partner to progress the art of storytelling.\u201d",

Being a few months in at Adobe, it\u2019s wonderful to see firsthand the role the company plays in bringing award-winning films to life.\n\nSince joining Adobe as Chief Marketing Officer, I have been blown away by the creativity and impact of Adobe\u2019s community across design, photography, film, animation, illustration, audio, 3D and more. It\u2019s a testament to our culture of innovation and Creativity for All ethos that for more than 40 years, Adobe has powered storytelling across all mediums.\n\nWe had the privilege of celebrating and advocating for the independent film community at the Sundance Film Festival last week. At Sundance, the Adobe House was the creative hub bringing together hundreds of filmmakers and film lovers to celebrate creative professionals and emerging filmmakers, as well as to discuss the role Adobe\u2019s products play in powering culture-defining storytelling.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from the conversations we\u2019re having with our customers and partners at studios, media companies and streaming platforms is that the confluence of technology and film is creating an exciting new chapter in how creators can tell their stories and how they are distributed and marketed.\n\nA24 is among the leading studios bringing a fresh perspective to film and television. Scott Belsky will soon leave Adobe to take up a new role as Partner at A24, and I\u2019m excited to see how his experience developing technology will translate to the entertainment industry.

We have always partnered with studios around the world, and we have already begun conversations with Scott and A24 on how the two companies can partner to progress the art of storytelling.\n\nAdobe has long been a foundational partner to the entertainment industry, with many original films and television shows powered by Adobe Creative Cloud applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Frame.io, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop and the Substance 3D Collection. This includes films like \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which was made possible using innovative techniques to create groundbreaking visuals; the hit series \u201cThe Bear\u201d which mastered tempo and rhythm; and most recently Oscar-nominated \u201cAnora.\u201d From indie directors making their first shorts to directors and editors working on a blockbuster scale, filmmakers rely on Adobe.

            "content": "Introducing unmetered access to Substance 3D Assets: Access what you need, when inspiration strikes\n\nToday marks a transformative moment for the Substance 3D community as we announce unmetered access to the complete Substance 3D Assets library for Adobe Substance 3D Subscribers. This means that every substance subscriber on a Collection or Texturing plan has access to the full collection of nearly 20,000 professional materials, models and lighting environments without managing points.\n\nThe Evolution of Substance 3D Assets\n\nWhat began in 2016 as Substance Source, a library of parametric materials, has grown into the industry\u2019s largest collection of truly customizable 3D content. From its origins in serving the game industry\u2019s need for optimized, high-quality materials, the library has evolved to support creators across industries, including packaging, product design and automotive visualization.\n\nThis growth has been driven by a dedicated team of expert Technical Artists, Substance 3D power users, and designers who carefully craft each asset to meet professional standards. Through various creation techniques \u2014 from full procedural development to high-end scanning \u2014 every asset meets the demanding needs of professional workflows.\n\nA professional library built by experts\n\nThe Substance 3D Assets library represents an unparalleled collection of high-quality, customizable 3D content:\n\nMaterials (13,000+)\n\nSubstance 3D Asset materials collection forms the cornerstone of the library, offering three distinct categories:\n\nSurfaces : Seamless parametric textures that can be tiled across any surface\n\n: Seamless parametric textures that can be tiled across any surface Decals : Specialized materials perfect for adding details, wear and unique characteristics\n\n: Specialized materials perfect for adding details, wear and unique characteristics Atlases: Collections of individual elements that can be scattered on surfaces to create more detailed materials.\n\nEach material adheres to PBR standards, ensuring consistent appearance across all renderers and real-time engines. Materials can be accessed in two powerful formats:\n\n.sbsar format : The ready-to-use Substance format containing all parameters needed to generate nearly unlimited variations. Adjust everything from color and roughness to pattern scale and wear as well as material-unique properties, all while maintaining photorealistic quality.\n\n: The ready-to-use Substance format containing all parameters needed to generate nearly unlimited variations. Adjust everything from color and roughness to pattern scale and wear as well as material-unique properties, all while maintaining photorealistic quality. .sbs format: The native Substance 3D Designer \u201crecipe\u201d showing exactly how the material was created. This provides both deep customization potential and invaluable learning opportunities for artists wanting to master material creation by deconstructing professionally built materials.\n\n3D Models (6,000+) Substance 3D Asset\u2019s model collection comes production-ready in either .fbx or .glb formats. Each model has been professionally prepared to streamline your workflow with:\n\nProfessionally unwrapped UVs\n\nCleaned and optimized polygon counts\n\nOrganized sub-components with proper pivot points\n\nSimply drag and drop these models into Substance 3D Painter or Stager and start applying materials immediately without the need for extensive technical preparation.\n\n3D HDR Lights Substance 3D Assets\u2019 lighting collection goes beyond standard HDRI panoramas by offering parametric control through the Substance format (.sbsar). These professional-quality HDR assets provide:\n\nIndependent control over individual light sources\n\nAdjustable parameters for temperature, intensity and color\n\nReal-time feedback when modifying lighting setups\n\nConsistent, physically accurate illumination across your scenes\n\nUnlike traditional HDRI environments, our parametric lights let you fine-tune details of your scene\u2019s illumination without switching between multiple assets. Modify the intensity of a window light while maintaining the ambient illumination, adjust the color temperature of key lights \u2014 or balance multiple light sources \u2014 all within a single asset.\n\nThese three asset types available in one library are perfect for jumpstarting your texturing projects or trying out new ideas. Whether you're looking to learn by experimenting with game assets, testing different approaches to product visualization \u2014 or staging and rendering scenes, you'll have everything you need to dive right in and start creating quickly.\n\nThe power of parametric control\n\nWhat truly sets Substance 3D Assets apart is the depth of parametric customization. Each material includes built-in parameters that let you adjust attributes like color, surface finish, pattern scale and more \u2014 while maintaining photorealistic quality. This flexibility means a single material can generate countless variations, perfect for exploring design options or creating consistent assets across your projects.\n\nOur scanning workflow, for example, combines photogrammetry-based capture with custom tools for making materials tileable and adding parametric controls. This ensures that even scanned materials offer the same flexibility and creative freedom as our procedural content.\n\nOur internal team of artists controls every step of the process, in tandem with partner reviews for real-world usage verification, from initial concept and design through production and technical implementation. This rigorous process ensures that every asset meets our high standards for both technical excellence and creative utility.\n\nEnhanced creative workflows\n\nUnmetered access transforms how you work, letting you download assets on-demand for concept exploration and mood boarding while quickly iterating on designs with ready-to-use models and materials. You can maintain consistent quality from concept to final render and focus on creating without worrying about download limits. This freedom also opens opportunities to learn from professional material graphs and techniques, and experiment with infinite variations through parametric controls.\n\nGet started today\n\nSubstance 3D subscribers can access the complete library through the Substance 3D Assets web portal or access materials directly within Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\n\nThis release represents our continued commitment to empowering creators with the tools and content they need to work more efficiently and creatively. Remember that if you\u2019re on an Adobe Substance 3D subscription plan, you now have access to the full library of materials, models and lights from Substance 3D Assets. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll create with unmetered access to Substance 3D Assets.\n\nVisit substance3d.adobe.com to learn more about Substance 3D Assets and start exploring the library today.",

Since then, the creative tech giant has been inviting select artists to test the product, which has resulted in tweaks based on their feedback. These include the addition of shareable canvases and artboards and the ability to import, share and remix work, making it easier to collaborate.\n\nThe user interface has been simplified too, making it easier to guide generative AI by using multiple types of inputs, like text prompts, images or individual ingredients from images. And Content Credentials has been integrated to recognize the source of images, respect generative AI usage and training preferences and to promote transparency regarding how content was created.\n\nThere are also now Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Express integrations to make it easier to bring assets into Project Concept from other Adobe apps.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nAdobe Flash, animation software produced by Adobe Systems Incorporated from 2005 to 2020.\n\nThe development of Adobe Flash software can be traced back to American software developer Jonathan Gay\u2019s first experiments with writing programs on his Apple II computer in high school during the 1980s. Before long, Gay had written a graphics program for the Apple II using Pascal. Later, he teamed up with a local Macintosh users-group organizer, Charlie Jackson, who started a Macintosh software company called Silicon Beach Software. At Silicon Beach Software, Gay combined animation and digital sound to create the Macintosh electronic game Airborne!. Eventually, in his drive to create animation software compatible with Apple Inc.\u2019s Macintosh and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Windows programs, he produced SmartSketch, a program in which users could draw on the computer screen with an electronic pen. This was the start of his own software company, FutureWave Software, in the mid-1990s.\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity, FutureWave added two-dimensional animation features to SmartSketch that let Internet users display graphics and animation over the World Wide Web, and FutureSplash Animator was born. The program\u2019s first success came when Microsoft used the software for their MSN website. Macromedia, Inc., bought the rights to FutureSplash Animator in 1996, creating Macromedia Flash, which became Adobe Flash after Adobe purchased Macromedia in 2005. Adobe Flash allowed users to create animation for use on the Internet, and Adobe\u2019s Flash Player was one of the most widely distributed applications on the Internet in the early 21st century, with many websites using the software.\n\nBritannica Quiz Classic Closing Lines\n\nHTML5 was the latest and widely available standard of the HTML language that encoded websites and allowed animation to be made without Flash. In 2010 Apple cofounder Steve Jobs wrote \u201cThoughts on Flash,\u201d in which he explained why Flash was not allowed on Apple\u2019s mobile devices, the iPhone, the iPod, and the iPad. Jobs reproved Adobe for Flash\u2019s poor security, frequent crashing, and voracious battery consumption. Through the 2010s many websites transitioned from Flash to HTML5. Adobe ended support for Flash on December 31, 2020.",

It can also be used on primitive groups.\n\nMesh to clay, used to convert imported polygonal models to SDF for editing, now uses adaptive subdivision, only subdividing areas needed to achieve a given clay resolution.\n\nDuring export, users can now reduce the poly count of an object by a percentage figure, rather than by setting an absolute value.\n\nVR mode gets a new system of camera previews. Non-physical objects like gizmos do not appear in previews, and users can opt to smooth the camera movement.\n\nThere are also a number of smaller workflow improvements: you can find a list via the link below.\n\nPrice and system requirements\n\nSubstance 3D Modeler is compatible with Windows 10+, and these VR headsets.\n\nIt is available via Substance 3D Collection subscriptions, which cost $49.99/month or $549.88/year. Perpetual licences are available via Steam, and cost $149.99.\n\nRead a full list of new features in Substance 3D Modeler in the release notes\n\n\n\nHave your say on this story by following CG Channel on Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).

Part of a vibrant close circle of friends growing up poor in rural Louisiana, she is determined to overcome the struggles and barriers defining them. Faced with limited minimum wage job options, Autumn devises an online sugar baby operation.\n\nThis documentary is directed by Rachel Fleit (\u201cBAMA RUSH\u201d), known for her nuanced explorations of identity and belonging. We had the opportunity to speak with editor Holle Singer about how she leveraged Adobe tools during every step of the creative process to bring Fleit\u2019s vision to life. Speech to Text in Premiere Pro was essential given various accents and audio recording challenges, After Effects kept shots clean and tidy, and Frame.io enabled seamless review rounds and collaboration on all cuts.\n\nRead more on the making of \u201cSugar Babies\u201d below, premiering at Sundance on January 27th.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nThe director, Rachel Fleit, and I have known each other for years and would discuss projects we were involved with. I always admired her work and hoped for the opportunity to collaborate. We ran into each other on the street, and she told me about \u201cSugar Babies.\u201d The stars aligned and it was the perfect project for us to come together on.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nI was standing with a friend in the bustling entranceway of a Chinese restaurant waiting for soupy buns to go. Rachel (the director) called me and told me the news. I was beyond excited. Literally jumping up and down in this crowded vestibule. My friend was baffled, staring at me like \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d I was ecstatic to hear this film I cared for so deeply was finally getting a chance to be seen and in the best possible place, Sundance.\n\nI still find myself washing my dishes or brushing my teeth and suddenly thinking, \u201cSugar Babies is going to Sundance!\u201d It\u2019s a dream come true.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nI am a creature of habit, so I set up this job the same as I set up pretty much every job. All the footage is stranded out and separated into bins (i.e., audio, footage, etc.) and each bin is broken down into other bins (i.e., B-Roll, iPhone and social media), which is then stranded out by day. Each set up has its own strand.\n\nRachel lives a block and a half from me, so we often opted to work from my home to have more time cutting and less time traveling. Working on Premiere Pro gave us the flexibility to have a roving workspace, dividing time between my office at Consulate, home space in my living room and working on a laptop out at the beach \u2013 sometimes out on the deck.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nThe DPs did a great job covering the verite action, which revolved around following many people moving between locations. The camera work was often handheld as they were shooting on the fly. I embraced the naive feeling of the footage but some shots needed a little extra help. Warp Stabilizer in Premiere Pro was helpful to reduce movement and stabilize shots.\n\nThe Denoise effect was very helpful cleaning up the audio.\n\nPremiere Pro was used for offline editing. It\u2019s my favorite app because it allows me to do everything I need technically (mix sound, cut picture and adjust color), so I can focus on creative storytelling. This project used iPhone footage, social media clips and different sized files from a variety of cameras. Premiere Pro allowed us to seamlessly import and edit all these formats. The Speech to Text feature was also wonderful. We were able to create transcriptions of strands and search keywords, which helped enormously in the editorial process. We also used After Effects to clean up and mask out signage in shots.\n\nWe used Frame.io for postings. It\u2019s a wonderful way to get feedback on cuts. Collaborators can literally write notes on the exact frame of the posting, which can then be imported into the Premiere Pro project timeline. Once the notes are on the timeline in the form of markers, I can change the marker color as I address the comments. This process is a very efficient way to make revisions.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to explore the effects panel. The best way to learn is by doing. We used a variety of effects like mirroring and artificial glitches to visually illustrate Autumn\u2019s life. I love to layer and experiment with effects which can instantly create wonderful, unexpected results that can poetically emphasize the story. In the case of \u201cSugar Babies,\u201d these effects help the viewer experience the disjointed discord the characters were going through emotionally.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nI don\u2019t have one specific inspiration. Thelma Schoonmaker, Julian Schnabel and Hank Corwin are a few creative heroes as they all seem to genuinely love to create and push boundaries. I\u2019m also inspired by the amazing work of every editor at Consulate. Play is such an important part of my process. I like to explore, research and experiment. I look at anything that makes me excited to cut.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nThe shifting of the industry over the decades has had many challenges. Things are constantly changing and what worked yesterday might not today. I have needed to adapt in many ways. But by ignoring a lot of it, focusing on the actual work, and doing the best job I can, business goes on, and I have been lucky to stay part of it.\n\nMy advice: follow what excites you. Focus on solutions instead of problems. Try not to get too attached to any solutions. As an editor, I look out for my director and their vision. It is their film not mine. As a collaborator, I do my best to creatively express their ideas and goals \u2013 sometimes in ways not originally scripted.\n\nIt is said every film is written three times: on the page, in production and lastly, in the edit room. I am grateful to be part of that immensely rewarding and exciting final draft when it all comes together.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nImage Source: Holle Singer Image Source: Holle Singer\n\nMy favorite thing about my home office is my cat, Littles.\n\nImage Source: Holle Singer Image Source: Holle Singer\n\nThe best thing about my office at work is the big, beautiful space. There\u2019s room for my wonderful assistant, James McClintock, a big screen TV and 3 monitors on my desk.",

You spent 14 years in various roles at ClickSoftware, before moving to and spending 13 years at Adobe, going through various roles to your current position, VP of international marketing. Could you walk us through your career path to date?\n\nAt school, I had two aspirations. The first was to be a professional footballer \u2013 I was a decent player but by age 16 I recognized that this was not going to happen! The second was to work for the Foreign Office. I studied International Relations at LSE and was selected to represent the UK at the World Model United Nations.\n\nEverything was in place for a career in the Foreign Office, but when I finished University, my uncle offered me two months\u2019 work at a small Israeli tech company called ClickSoftware (acquired by Salesforce in 2019). He was looking for someone to help open their office in the UK and so I offered to set this up on the top floor of my grandparents\u2019 house. I was doing everything: answering the phone, picking up the post, making cold calls, sending faxes, meeting customers, booking space at events, writing press releases. It was business development, marketing and sales all round into one (not that I realized it) \u2013 it was a great training ground.\n\nWith it also being a startup, it was the start of my journey into the tech industry. I fortunately was surrounded by some incredibly talented individuals, many of whom have become my mentors and closest friends. We took the company public in 2000, by which time I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in marketing. As the company grew, so did my remit. Starting with EMEA, then JAPAC, then heading up global marketing and joining the executive team \u2013 the experience allowed me to build out a marketing team around the world. It gave me great exposure to different cultures and allowed me to hone my skills as both a marketer and a business leader.\n\nIn 2011, I was approached by Adobe. The company had recently acquired Omniture and they were looking for someone to lead this marketing area in EMEA. They invited me to attend one of their events \u2013 soon to become Adobe Summit EMEA \u2013 and I was blown away by the scale, production and overall experience of the event, with over 1000 people in attendance. I vividly recall Adobe\u2019s then CMO, Ann Lewnes (who I would eventually report to) delivering a keynote on the art and science of marketing. The opportunity to market marketing software to marketers felt like a dream job and was too good to turn down.\n\nIt was also a key moment for the business as Adobe was embarking on its own digital transformation journey to become a subscription-based business. Almost overnight there were new business models, direct relationships with customers, whole new audiences and product data to analyze and utilize. It was an incredible time to join the company.\n\n2024 sees me completing my 13th year at Adobe and I now lead international marketing in our global marketing organiszation. I am genuinely excited to go to work every day and to deliver on our mission of changing the world through personalized digital experiences, as well as help unlock growth around the world. At the same time, I am part of a brand that continues to make meaningful, lasting change in the world \u2013 you can\u2019t get better than that.\n\nWhen I look back at my career to date, I think a couple of things have served me well. One is to not be motivated by a title but be motivated by the opportunity. Raise your hand, ask questions and be curious. The second is to be a decent human being. Treat everyone you know - whether it be your team members, colleagues across functions, vendors, agency partners or the people cleaning the office - with respect.\n\nAmong Adobe\u2019s suite of products, Adobe Express is completely free to use\n\nCould you explain the offer at Adobe?\n\nAt Adobe we constantly innovate by offering incredible technology that powers everyone, everywhere to imagine, create and bring any digital experience to life. Whether that be a student who might be starting on their creative journey, a creative professional who uses our tools daily to create and design incredible content or a small business owner or large multinational organization that wants to reach their customers through multiple digital touchpoints \u2013 Adobe makes it possible. Our three solutions include Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud \u2013 all of which are used by billions of people and industries around the world.\n\nOur acceleration in generative AI also means anyone can create! We supercharge creators and empower marketers in the creative process to drive innovation, streamline processes to unlock capacity and connect more deeply with customers.\n\nAdobe\u2019s London Headquarters\n\nWhat are your key responsibilities as VP of international marketing?\n\nMy team sits within our global marketing organization, reporting into our chief marketing officer. Our job is to unlock growth across international markets through a combination of taking global programs, adapting them where relevant and making sure they meet the needs of the local market. It\u2019s imperative that we deeply understand the needs of our local customers and make sure that our messaging and value propositions are tailored for these.\n\nI have teams across EMEA, APAC and Japan covering all aspects of the marketing mix. We use our own martech stack \u2013 Adobe\u2019s Experience Cloud \u2013 to power our marketing. Most recently, we have been rolling out Adobe\u2019s Gen Studio for performance marketing. This generative AI-first application is empowering my team to create their own ads and emails to drive impactful, personalized marketing campaigns.\n\nReviewing Adobe\u2019s financial reporting, I can see that the business has over 29,000 employees and revenues of $21.51bn. In June this year, you announced your AI-powered content hub to help brands manage millions of creative assets. In summary, you\u2019re smashing it financially and are positioned at the cutting edge of content management. So as a senior marketer for Adobe, what does 2025 look like to you?\n\nContent is a key focus for us. Right now, marketing content is exploding and it\u2019s only going to get bigger. Brands that want to deliver personalized experiences now require more content than ever before. Using Adobe as an example, one of the areas we have been trying to address is around our content supply chain.\n\nIf I just look at the last quarter and limit myself to looking at paid social, and display channels, we advertise across 15 different channels, eight different products, 35 different languages, three variants and then three refreshes to avoid ad fatigue. To deliver on this, we require close to 40,000 pieces of content.\n\nAnd we know that\u2019s still not enough! Every platform encourages you to submit as many variants of content as you can. The more variants you have, the better you can optimize and ensure you are getting it in front of the right person at the right time.\n\nEvery brand is faced with a similar conundrum. How do you find a solution that\u2019s going to enable you to tackle this challenge at scale? Thankfully, that\u2019s where Gen Studio is helping us! From planning to production to design to analysis, generative AI is proving to be a huge enabler to deliver personalized marketing campaigns and experiences at a scale we\u2019ve never been able to do before.\n\nWe\u2019ve also recognized that we need to up-skill our marketing teams so that they are empowered to use the technology whilst also appreciating the importance of brand consistency. We know that if we can solve this challenge for Adobe, we can then solve it for all our customers around the world.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Wembley take-over for 2023\u2019s Women\u2019s FA Cup Final\n\nWhat\u2019s your first memory of a marketing success that you were part of where you felt: \u201cThis is me. This is the role for me.\u201d\n\nThe marketing campaigns that we\u2019ve run that really stand out for me are the ones built on a solid foundation of science, and then executed with incredible art and a deep understanding of our audience.\n\nA few years ago, we ran a series of campaigns under the umbrella of \u2018Hidden Treasures\u2019 where we bridged the gap between physical and digital art. From Van Gogh to Keith Haring to David Bowie, the campaign sought to preserve and share the works of great artists that have changed the world, putting their tools in the hands of today\u2019s creators. In the case of Bowie, to mark his 75th birthday and 50th anniversary of perhaps his most famous alter ego, Ziggy Stardust, we looked to empower people to unleash their own personas.\n\nWe created a range of Bowie-inspired digital tools and gave them away for free across certain Creative Cloud apps. The new tools included a range of make-up brushes; texture and pattern samplers that will let creatives sample the fabrics and patterns of Bowie\u2019s well-known outfits; \u200ba collection of backgrounds & 3D Substance props inspired by David\u2019s posters and album covers; and a sticker pack, featuring iconic Bowie-related graphics. It was so inspiring to see what our creative community created with all these tools.\n\nMore recently, we launched an exciting campaign for Adobe Express \u2013 Your Someday is Today \u2013 to crush the misconception that our tools are only for the creative professional and are expensive. It\u2019s our goal to show that with tools like Adobe Express, an all-in-one AI content creation app, anyone can create stunning social posts, videos and flyers, no matter their skill level. Moreover, it\u2019s simple and free, allowing for powerful storytelling. Your Someday is Today involved us partnering with small businesses such as Yendy Skin, to make waves across the country with incredible billboards, ad spots and interactive workshops at tube stations so people could get their own headshots captured and design their own mugs.\n\nWe\u2019ve also partnered with The Football Association for the Adobe Women\u2019s FA Cup with the goal to reach a younger audience. Our work with The FA is built on the shared belief that there are so many incredible stories in the women\u2019s game going untold. Our mission with Adobe Express is to help clubs, players and fans share their stories with the world, bringing them to life in beautiful ways.\n\nWe\u2019ve given free access to Adobe Express Premium plans to all 514 clubs in the competition, with access to training and customizable templates so they can quickly and easily connect with their fanbase. This is game-changing for amateur clubs because so many are supported by volunteers or have players with multiple jobs, with little time to market and promote their clubs. It\u2019s been so rewarding to see so many clubs embrace our technology, and see them create great content for their platforms, raising awareness for upcoming matches and of their players. Whilst it\u2019s massively rewarding to be partnering with The FA, frankly it\u2019s more rewarding to receive an email from the social media volunteer at a small South London football club who attended a workshop and now has the ability to create content like never before, driving more interest in their games.\n\nUsers can add and remove content from images using simple text prompts powered by Adobe Firefly generative AI\n\nHow do you navigate the plethora of media choices available today, from sponsorship to out-of-home via email to addressable TV, to name but a few.\n\nFor a long time now, there has been so much choice available to brands when deciding how to reach and engage audiences. At Adobe everything we do is data driven and we take that ethos into our marketing. We have an amazing data science group who have built market leading planning and attribution tools that help us to navigate the routes to market. That process starts with Adobe Mix Modeller, which helps us identify the level of investment required across the funnel to deliver against our marketing and business goals.\n\nThe output of Adobe Mix Modeller helps us prioritize the stage of the funnel we need to be focusing on and from that, we work with our agency partners and data science team to identify the most optimum channel mix to achieve our goal. Next, we\u2019ll explore the best media tactics to support this and use historical data to inform decisions on which media tactics will help deliver against our goal. Critical to us when we make these decisions is that we have alignment on how to measure success and close the loop on our marketing activations so that we can continue to learn throughout every marketing program we run.\n\nThe final step in the planning process before we move forward involves reflecting on the strategy and approach built. The key questions we ask ourselves include: Are we reaching the right target audience? Where do we need to be seen? How do we integrate media, PR, social and partnerships to make the plan work harder? Where else can we reach our audiences? Could it be sponsoring a podcast? Could it involve a partnership like the Women\u2019s FA Cup.\n\nA recent example is our partnership with Steven Bartlett for Adobe Express. Our goal was to reach a small business audience and so we partnered with someone known for founding their own small business. And this wasn\u2019t only a partnership because we found ways to provide actual support for a small business and planned a media mix that would help us achieve our goals.\n\nThe player tunnel at the Adobe Women\u2019s FA Cup 2024\n\nHow do you go about balancing both the long-term brand building with short-term sales activations?\n\nWe\u2019re very intentional about laying out KPIs for every marketing initiative, having a strategy for full funnel. If you're not priming the top of the funnel with more brand-building initiatives, you\u2019re not going to have great success further along when you get to your performance initiatives.\n\nMeasuring unaided awareness is a long-term brand building activity and is essential, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use other methods to identify some of the signals or indicators to assist your marketing mission. It's important to have these indicators mapped out along the way to give you and the business the confidence you need \u2013 and confirm that you\u2019re on the right path.\n\nDDOM, our data-driven operating model, is our playbook at Adobe for deriving and acting on data-driven insights. This approach has fundamentally shifted how we operate by creating a common language around data, KPIs and measurement. It really helped break down existing internal silos and ensured that all teams were marching towards a common goal.\n\nIts key tenets are commonality of data, consistent measurement, actionable insights and data governance. This kind of data-driven operating model permeates how we run our entire business. And it\u2019s not only enhanced our customer experience over the last few years, but it has made our entire business more agile and adaptable as we continue with our own transformation.\n\nThe reality is that a huge percentage of your market is not looking to buy right now. I believe that the goal of marketing is to make sure when a business or an individual is ready to buy, our brand is top of mind.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that we can be highly targeted with our brand building. We think about: how do we inspire? We think about how you sponsor the right podcasts or collaborate with the right creators; how to be present with the right communities. All those elements are essential, as we build trust and foster word of mouth growth in the right circles.\n\nIt all begins with a deep understanding of whom you seek to serve, and then getting the leadership to understand and appreciate the impact of the of brand marketing on long term growth. For us, long term brand growth is about creating meaningful relevance and lasting connections with our customers.\n\nAs part of their continued support for Women\u2019s football, Adobe helps football teams to create their own promotional content\n\nIn your opinion, how can creative ideas help a brand stand out and connect with its audience?\n\nAt Adobe we believe creativity is a superpower that lies in each and every one of us. The UK creative industry employs 2.4 million people and the industry generated \u00a3126bn in gross value to the economy in 2022.\n\nCreativity provides an amazing way for people to express themselves and to reflect the world in which we live \u2013 it literally creates the future. We believe that everybody has the right to share their story, and the more we can empower people with the right tools to help them do so, the more the world will be a richer and diverse place.\n\nAs a company, we\u2019re also laser-focused on how we become the trusted partner for every part of the creative evolution. Our goal is to empower creators to create the future and at the same time, ensure they\u2019re renumerated and not exploited for their work. We fundamentally believe that technology will never replace human imagination and artistry. In fact, we see technology as a tool to fuel creativity, aid productivity and deliver the power precision that creators expect.\n\nIn line with our ambitions to transform access to the arts and creative expression for young people, The Adobe Foundation initiated the Adobe x Museums program which includes partnerships with the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London. At the V&A we support the full-time, paid employment of three creative residents each year who get access to the studio space, mentorships and their work displayed at the museum for an entire year.\n\nThe residencies also support connection with community and by doing so, widening participation in the arts, particularly in areas across the UK where access and learning is limited. We\u2019re on track helping the V&A triple engagement through its public programming efforts and we hope to reach 250,000 people this year \u2013 that\u2019s 250,000 more people who might feel inspired to tap into their creative superpowers.\n\nThree creatives are invited each year to take residence at Londo\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum, sponsored by Adobe: Rachel Sale, Luca Bosani and Jacqui Ramrayka\n\nWhat myth about marketing would you most like to bust?\n\nPeople say in marketing that everything has changed and everything must be transformed. I disagree. Sir John Hegarty said: \u201cPrinciples remain, practices change.\u201d I believe that marketing will always be about how you communicate and connect with your customers \u2013 how you tell the story about the value that your business provides.\n\nMarketing is about engaging, inspiring and motivating your customers. That\u2019s always been the case and will always be the case. Yes, some things will evolve. Right now, we\u2019re seeing the fusion of AI and storytelling, how that\u2019s transforming the way brands connect with their audience. This means having a deep understanding of and connection with your customer remains fundamental.\n\nContinuing to connect Adobe with creativity and sport: Adobe helped to redesign Camden Town WFC\u2019s kit with player feedback in mind\n\nYour question from another senior marketer is this: tell us about a failure you experienced and what you learned from it?\n\nIf you\u2019re not failing regularly, you\u2019re not testing enough, and we try new things all the time. I can\u2019t think of one big failure example, but I would just say where failings have tended to appear is when you deliver an initiative that is not deeply connected to the outcomes your business cares about!\n\nYou might have a brilliant idea but for success it must be completely connected to the business. The sweet spot is the overlap between the customer need and the business need.\n\nWhat is your question for the next senior marketer I interview? What would you like to ask them?\n\nIn such a fast-changing digital landscape, how do you remain innovative and agile with your marketing strategies, whilst maintaining a consistent brand identity across multiple marketing channels and audiences?\n\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self, if you could go back in time?\n\nThere are three key things that things that I\u2019ve learned along the way: I would advise anyone to declare your career goals and your objectives early. I would also stress the value of storytelling as audiences tend to remember stories, not statistics. Great storytelling allows you to leave an impression. And finally, I would recommend building relationships with key stakeholders: make sure there\u2019s common understanding of the business objectives.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you know about marketing, it is\u2026\n\nMarketing drives profitable business growth. It is a hugely important responsibility and it\u2019s a great time to be a marketer. There\u2019s so many challenges including how you embrace change and how you leverage generative AI storytelling to connect with your audiences. And whilst they\u2019re challenges, they\u2019re also amazing opportunities.\n\nYou might die tomorrow so make it worth your while.

( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 18x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nAdobe's earnings growth of late has been pretty similar to most other companies. It might be that many expect the mediocre earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nDoes Growth Match The High P/E?\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nAdobe's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 4.9% last year. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 26% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 11% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Adobe's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Adobe's P/E?\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nWe've established that Adobe maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

            "content": "Cancer | Image Credit: \u00a9 catalin - stock.adobe.com\n\nThe combination of bezuclastinib (CGT9486) and sunitinib (Sutent) generated favorable efficacy outcomes compared with historical data, as well as long-term tolerability, in patients with previously treated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), according to findings from part 1 of the phase 3 Peak study (NCT05208047) that were presented at the 2025 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.\n\nIn the open-label, multicenter trial, the median progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients (n = 42) was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.4-19.4), and patients had received a median of 2.5 (range, 1-6) prior TKIs. The median PFS in patients receiving the combination in the second-line setting following treatment with imatinib (Gleevec) was 19.4 months (95% CI, 1.0-not estimable). Notably, 3 of 7 patients treated with 1 prior TKI remain on the treatment beyond 19 months.\n\n\u201cEfficacy compares favorably to historical data in previously treated GIST,\u201d Jonathan C. Trent, MD, PhD, and study co-authors wrote in a poster presentation of the data. \u201cEncouraging long-term safety and tolerability [was seen] with combination bezuclastinib and sunitinib therapy in part 1, with a median treatment duration of 32 weeks.\u201d\n\nTrent currently serves as the associate director of Clinical Research and the director of the Sarcoma Medical Research Program in the Department of Medicine in the Division of Medical Oncology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida.\n\nUnderstanding the Methods of the Trial\n\nIn 80% of GIST cases, primary activating mutations are found in KIT, mostly in exon 11 or exon 9, the study authors wrote in the poster. Although the TKI imatinib may be used to inhibit the mutation, resistance to the drug increases to 60% within 2 years. This is driven by additional mutations in KIT exons 13/14 or exons 17/18.\n\nThe investigational combination of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib allows for broad activity across a spectrum of mutations and may target the full spectrum of primary and secondary resistance. This approach was also examined in the phase 1/2 PLX121-01 trial (NCT02401815), in which bezuclastinib plus sunitinib was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumors.\n\nAt the meeting, investigators presented findings from parts 1a\u2014the optimized formulation lead-in portion (n = 19)\u2014and 1b\u2014the investigational drug-drug interaction portion (n = 23)\u2014of the Peak study. In part 1a, bezuclastinib was given at a 300-mg dose or a 600-mg dose daily in combination with sunitinib at a 37.5-mg dose daily; the selected dose was then used in part 1b.\n\nNotably, in part 2, the randomized portion of the study, patients who had received prior imatinib were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 600 mg of bezuclastinib plus 37.5 mg of sunitinib daily or sunitinib alone at 37.5 mg daily, though sunitinib treatment begins on day 2. Also in part 2, mutational circulating tumor DNA is being collected at baseline and at disease progression. In the sunitinib monotherapy arm, patients who progress may be eligible to cross over to the investigational treatment arm.\n\nPatients were eligible for enrollment so long as they had histologically confirmed GIST with at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria; locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease; documented disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib; an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; and at least 1 prior line of therapy (to be eligible for part 1a), at least 2 prior TKIs (for part 1b), or prior imatinib treatment only (for part 2).\n\nThe primary end point of part 1a was the pharmacokinetics of bezuclastinib; the primary end point of part 1b was the pharmacokinetics of bezuclastinib, sunitinib, and the primary active metabolite of sunitinib; and the primary end point of part 2 is PFS per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Notably, the current enrollment status of all 3 study parts is complete.\n\nIn patients enrolled across both part 1a and 1b (n = 42), 81.0% were men; the median age was 59.5 years (range, 33-77); and patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (57.1%), 1 (40.5%), or 2 (2.4%). The median number of prior therapies patients received was 2.5 (range, 1-6), and patients had received a total of either 1 (16.7%) or 2 or more (83.3%) prior TKI therapies. These prior therapies consisted of imatinib (100%), sunitinib (66.7%), ripretinib (Qinlock; 50.0%), and regorafenib (Stivarga; 35.7%). Additionally, patients received prior treatment with radiotherapy (23.8%) as well as prior anticancer surgery (90.5%).\n\nThe primary tumor location at diagnosis for patients included the stomach (16.7%), small intestine (54.8%), and other abdominal locations (28.6%). The primary mutation locations consisted of exon 9 (19%), exon 11 (47.6%), and others (33.3%). The median number of weeks patients had on treatment was 32.1 (range, 1.9-102.7). As of the April 1, 2024, data cutoff date, 11 (26.2%) patients remained on treatment, and 31 patients had discontinued treatment (73.8%) due to disease progression (52.4%), withdrawn consent (7.1%), clinical progression (7.1%), adverse effect (AE; 4.8%), or enrollment onto another therapeutic study (2.4%).\n\nAdditional Data and Safety Outcomes\n\nLooking to responses observed per investigator assessment, treatment with bezuclastinib plus sunitinib resulted in an objective response rate of 27.5% in all patients and 33% in patients with prior imatinib. In all patients, 27.5% had a partial response, 57.5% had stable disease, and 15.0% had progressive disease. Additionally, the disease control rate was 80%.\n\nRegarding safety, the majority of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were of low CTCAE grade and reversible. In total, 3 patients experienced serious AEs, including grade 2 neutrophil count decrease and pyrexia and grade 3 platelet count decrease; grade 2 bacterial peritonitis and grade 3 febrile neutropenia; and grade 3 anemia, asthenia, and peripheral edema. All 3 patients\u2019 serious AEs were suspected to be associated with study medications.\n\nMoreover, dose reductions of study medications due to TEAEs occurred in 29% of patients, and 2 patients in total discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, including grade 2 rash and grade 1 abdominal pain, as well as grade 3 diarrhea.\n\n\u201cThe combination of bezuclastinib and sunitinib does not appear to add to the severity of AEs associated with sunitinib monotherapy and is well tolerated, [with a] median treatment duration of 32 weeks,\u201d Trent and coauthors wrote in the poster.\n\nPatients on both parts 1a and part 1b of the study experienced grade 3 or higher diarrhea (5%), hypertension (17%), neutropenia (7%), increased alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase levels (5%), anemia (7%), and hypokalemia (2%). Common all-grade AEs included diarrhea (69%), fatigue (55%), hypertension (45%), nausea (40%), hair color changes (36%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (31%), taste disorder (31%), decreased appetite (29%), rash (26%), and neutropenia (21%).\n\n\u201c[The] combination was well tolerated with infrequent discontinuations due to AEs,\u201d the study authors concluded in the poster.\n\nReference\n\nTrent J, Wagner A, Attia S, et al.

After tenderly bonding with a local farmer, Anand must decide the fate of his relationship born under duress when the mourning period ends.\n\nAthaley relied on Premiere Pro\u2019s intuitive and customizable tools to edit this touching narrative, leveraging its powerful masking tools to combine elements from different takes into a single shot and clean up dialogue with Enhance Speech. Athaley says Premiere Pro\u2019s integration with other tools in Adobe\u2019s Creative Suite was key: \u201cWe used Photoshop and After Effects to create draft graphics, helping us determine the usability of certain takes and mask elements in some shots.\u201d\n\nRead on for an inside look at editing \u201cSabar Bonda,\u201d premiering at Sundance on January 26th.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nI was in the middle of working on the edit of a narrative series when I got a call from Rohan, the film's director. We instantly connected over the storyline. Having lost my father a few years earlier, I deeply resonated with the protagonist's journey. After reading the full screenplay and the director\u2019s notes on the treatment, I was also drawn to the film\u2019s unique form and visual language.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nI was making some edit changes to our film after a detailed discussion earlier with the director. He called me to give this news and I was elated and relieved in some sense! Sundance feels like the perfect home for this film and its audience. I\u2019ve always admired the quality of narratives showcased at Sundance and it\u2019s incredibly humbling to be part of such a prestigious festival.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nI keep the setup as simple and minimalist as possible. At the start, I discuss the workflow with my team\u2014my associate Smaran, in this case\u2014so everyone knows where to find things. We begin by cloning the hard drives and maintaining a consistent file structure throughout the edit. My team sets up the project, syncs sound, creates multicam sequences or subclips for every take, and labels them with colors based on the director's notes. Once everything is organized, I step in to watch the rushes, make my selects, and build the lineup. For this film, Smaran would line-up some scenes for me, and then I focused on watching the rushes and refining those scenes. We did this for some scenes that were more open to interpretation.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes in the film is when Anand, the protagonist, is traveling to the city with his cousin, who doesn\u2019t know Anand is queer. The cousin innocently asks about Anand\u2019s \"girlfriend,\" a fictional story Anand\u2019s parents invented to explain his lack of interest in marriage. Anand fabricates further, saying she got married and wanted to stay in touch, but he refused. The cousin then jokes about having an affair and even offers to take Anand to a doctor to treat \"secret sexual disorders.\" All of this unfolds as Anand texts Balya, someone he\u2019s beginning to fall for. This scene stands out to me for its sharp observation, subtle humor, and poignant commentary on the societal pressures and complexities of concealing queerness.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nWe completed shooting in mid-January, and with the Berlinale EFM approaching quickly, the film\u2019s producer, Neeraj, wanted to take an impactful 8-minute mood reel. We worked with urgency to review the rushes, edit the film, and craft the reel, which helped us garner a lot of interest in Berlin. During the shoot, the production team provided proxy files, enabling us to preview the footage and start building scenes simultaneously. Adobe\u2019s versatile suite was instrumental in streamlining this process.\n\nThe film features many long takes, often with multiple characters in the frame or involving intricate choreography, which made it challenging to get everything right, especially in unpredictable weather conditions. In such cases, we relied on Premiere Pro\u2019s powerful masking tools to combine elements from different takes into a single shot. For instance, in one scene, we masked a cat from another take into the final shot because the performance was perfect, but the chosen take lacked the cat. In another, we used masking to extend the stay on one character while the other observed them intently. These tools provided remarkable flexibility to refine the visuals and achieve the desired emotional impact.\n\nWe kept the setup simple and edited the film using Premiere Pro. We also used Media Encoder for transcoding and creating proxies. I\u2019ve been using Premiere Pro for years and find it very intuitive and user-friendly. There is an active online community that gives feedback to Adobe resulting in frequent improvements and updates, which is a big plus. I also value the sound tools in Premiere Pro, especially the Enhance Speech feature which cleans the dialogue and gives us space to imagine the film's sound design during editing. The integration within Adobe Creative Cloud was a bonus\u2014we used Photoshop and After Effects to create draft graphics, helping us determine the usability of certain takes and mask elements in some shots.\n\nWe discovered Frame.io a little late in the process. We used Frame.io to securely send screeners to our producers and persons giving us feedback who were in various countries to watch and give feedback.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nPremiere Pro is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the workflow to your needs and create custom workspaces. You also can open multiple sequences simultaneously, making sorting and selecting shots much easier. I keep my \u2018Selects\u2019 sequence open while docking other sequences above, allowing me to lift shots seamlessly\u2014this keeps the process smooth and organic.\n\nIf the film's language is supported by Speech to Text in Premiere Pro, I highly recommend transcribing all the rushes. It\u2019s incredibly helpful for quickly searching for specific dialogues or keywords!\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nI\u2019m inspired by artists with truly distinct styles that they never shy away from. Editors like Sally Menke, Thelma Schoonmaker, and Walter Murch have created work that feels like a masterclass in itself. Sally Menke\u2019s playful style, especially in films like \u201cKill Bill\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d has been a huge inspiration\u2014her ability to shape the flow of energy is brilliant. I\u2019m also deeply influenced by Tim Burton\u2019s interpretation of magic realism, particularly in underrated gems like \u201cBig Fish\u201d and \u201cEd Wood.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nAfter graduating from film school, I began working as an editor on a commissioned short documentary that tackled a very sensitive subject. At the time, I approached it with a theoretical understanding of activism, but I was eventually asked to leave the project as the edit was very didactic. It was a shocking experience for me, and I decided never to work on documentaries again. However, over time, I learned how to craft layered stories and eventually attempted another documentary film, which I thoroughly enjoyed working on. Since then, I\u2019ve edited many documentaries, and it has become my favorite form of storytelling.\n\nMy advice to aspiring filmmakers is simple: filmmaking is a journey of both successes and failures. When you fail, take the time to regroup, reflect, and keep moving forward.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nImage Source: Anadi Athaley\n\nI have a two-monitor setup with a Mac Studio, a set of studio monitors, and a lot of trinkets sprinkled around from various films. The most essential element is my footrest, which keeps my feet cozy during long edits.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has gained 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.02 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues",

This regimen could be an alternative therapeutic approach for these patients,\" lead study investigator Jianjun Peng, MD, PhD, and colleagues wrote in a poster presentation of the data. Peng is a gastrointestinal surgeon at The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China.\n\nPhase 2 Trial Enrollment and Treatment Objectives\n\nEligible patients were required to be 18 to 75 years of age with metastatic or recurrent CRC who previously received at least 2 treatment regimens. An ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria; and no prior exposure to anti-VEGFR therapy were required for enrollment.\n\nAll patients received fruquintinib at 4 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 combined with TAS-102 at 35 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12 of every 4-week cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nThe primary end point of the study was PFS. Secondary end points included objective response rate, disease control rate, OS, and safety/tolerability.\n\nA total of 50 patients were enrolled between March 2022 and August 2023. The median age of the cohort was 60 years (range, 39-76), and 58.0% of the patients were male. Patients received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-4); 16.0% and 4.0% of patients received 3 and 4 prior lines of therapy, respectively. All patients had received prior 5-fluorouracil, and most had also received irinotecan (90.0%) and oxaliplatin (98.0%); other prior chemotherapies included raltitrexed (18.0%) and S-1 (2.0%). Prior anti-VEGF/anti-EGFR therapy included bevacizumab (Avastin; 88.0%), cetuximab (Erbitux; 26.0%), or both (20.0%).\n\nForty-two percent of patients had RAS mutations, 16.0% had RAS wild-type disease, and 24.0% had an unknown RAS status. Primary tumors originated in the rectum (48.0%), left side of the colon (34.0%), and right side of the colon (18.0%). Liver metastases were reported at baseline in 58.0% of patients; 60.0% had lung metastases, and 18.0% had peritoneal metastases. Seventy-six percent of patients presented with two or more metastatic sites.\n\nAs of the January 10, 2024, data cutoff, 46 patients had undergone at least 1 tumor assessment, and 7 patients remained on therapy.\n\nAdditional Efficacy Insights\n\nPFS data were consistent across key subgroups. Patients with liver metastases achieved a median PFS of 6.33 months (95% CI, 4.13-8.62) vs 6.46 months (95% CI, 3.74-NA) in patients without liver metastases (P = .54). Similarly, patients with peritoneal metastases experienced a median PFS of 6.07 months; 95% CI, 3.74-NA) vs 6.33 months (95% CI, 4.20-8.27) for those without peritoneal metastases (P = .95).\n\nCox model results showed no significant impact on PFS based on primary site (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.49-2.3; P = .86), number of prior treatment lines (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.83-1.3; P = .68), age (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.59-2.3; P = .65), number of metastatic sites (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.1; P = .96), or KRAS mutation status (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6-2.7; P = .52). Similarly, no significant associations with OS were observed for these variables.\n\nSafety Observations\n\nTreatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) were primarily hematologic and consistent with the known safety profile of this combination. The most common any-grade TRAEs reported in at least 10% of patients included decreased neutrophil count (any-grade, 80%; grade \u22653, 54%), decreased white blood cell count (70%; 26%), anemia (58%; 20%), proteinuria (50%; 4%), decreased platelet count (44%; 10%), decreased lymphocyte count (40%; 8%), increased thyroid stimulating hormone level (32%; 0%; hypoalbuminemia (30%; 2%), increased blood bilirubin level (26%; 12%), hypertriglyceridemia (22%; 4%), loss of appetite (22%; 0%), high cholesterol (18%; 0%), elevated aspartate or alanine aminotransferase levels (14%; 0%), fatigue (14%; 0%), abdominal pain (12%; 0%), diarrhea (12%; 0%), vomiting (10%; 0%), headache (10%; 0%), hypertension (10%; 2%), and nausea (10%; 0%).\n\nReference\n\nPeng J, Long J, Huang L, et al.

Nakamura\n\nPremiering at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, \u201cThird Act\u201d tells the story of director Tadashi \u201cTad\u201d Nakamura and his father, Robert \u201cBob\u201d A. Nakamura, known to many as \u201cthe godfather of Asian American media.\u201d\n\nThis touching documentary not only chronicles Bob\u2019s monumental life and career, but also tracks the influence it had on Tad\u2019s own sense of self, artistry and citizenship. What emerges is an exploration of art, activism, grief, fatherhood and legacy that paints an intimate, emotional picture of the Asian American experience.\n\nWe sat down with the film\u2019s editor, Victoria Chalk, ACE, and the creative director of motion graphics, Travis Hatfield, to discuss how they used Premiere Pro and its Productions feature, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign to craft this highly meta project about filmmaking and set up a completely remote workflow for seamless collaboration in post.\n\nNot only did Chalk work closely with Tad to transform the story from a straightforward biographical documentary into the intergenerational narrative it is today, but Hatfield\u2019s motion graphics also brought the artistry of the film full circle: \u201c[The film] is about two generations of filmmakers/artists telling stories through the lens of a camera. I took my lead from that and set out to create motion graphics that did the same thing\u2014told the story through a camera (albeit a virtual one).\u201d\n\nRead on for a behind-the-scenes look at making \u201cThird Act.\u201d\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nHATFIELD: I am the Creative Director at Flash Cuts, a boutique production/post-production company in Los Angeles. We were approached by Tad early on to bring on producer Eurie Chung and facilitate the film from production through delivery. As creative director, I designed the workflow and set up the project using Productions in Premiere Pro to help streamline the finishing process of the film and set up a remote working environment for the editor, assistant editors and director to collaborate. I also designed all of the motion graphics in the film using After Effects and was the online and finishing editor.\n\nCHALK: Tad and Eurie had been working on the project in post production already with an assistant editor for about a year when they reached out to me. Tad usually edits his own stuff but this film, like many personal documentaries, was proving to be challenging to edit. I saw some of the footage and immediately wanted to be a part of it.\n\nTravis, how did you first get into motion graphics? What drew you to it?\n\nHATFIELD: I\u2019ve worked in post-production for over 20 years, and most of my skills have been acquired through necessity. I found early on that it was sometimes difficult to explain the ideas I had in my mind so made it a personal goal to learn everything I could so I could understand the process, but also bring whatever idea I had in my mind to life without relying on someone else. Since the very first time I opened up After Effects, with only a tiny window on the left side of the screen, and no real information on how to get started, I just started and figured it out.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nHATFIELD: I was at my station, finishing up some tweaks to some of the motion graphics in the film. I was excited, not for myself but for Tad, Victoria and Eurie who have spent years working on the project, always thinking Sundance was a long shot. I\u2019m one of the few people who stayed out of the process until the finishing, so I only saw the result of their journey.\n\nCHALK: I was at my station in my home office doing exports when Tad called me. He just said laughing, \u201cVic, we did it!\u201d and I immediately knew but couldn\u2019t believe it! We had worked so hard on finding the story of this film, and it felt for the first time that somehow we had managed to do so. I also asked Tad what his dad said. Bob Nakamura is a filmmaker and their father/son-filmmaking relationship is at the heart of the film. He was really happy!\n\nTravis, what was the inspiration behind your motion graphics work on the film? What were you trying to achieve?\n\nHATFIELD: The film is kind of meta and also deeply personal. It\u2019s about two generations of filmmakers/artists telling stories through the lens of a camera. I took my lead from that and set out to create motion graphics that did the same thing\u2014told the story through a camera (albeit a virtual one). The goal was always to make things feel practical and not computer generated, so that involved lots of scanning photos, taking photos of walls, albums, and other practical elements that could be composited in a 3D space, where I could use a virtual camera to tell the story. I used After Effects because it has all the tools to bring my ideas to life, and it works seamlessly with Premiere Pro and Photoshop.\n\nHow did you begin this project? Can you talk about the collaborative process with the director/editor/motion graphics and the process of creating your work from start to finish?\n\nHATFIELD: This project started during that dreaded time of COVID-19 in 2020, so working remotely was always the plan. This was actually one of the first projects that we used Productions on. We mirrored two drives with all the proxy media and used Dropbox to create a seamless working environment, so we could work as if we were all in the same room. I\u2019ve known both Tad and Victoria for a little bit, so working together with them was a joy for me. During the offline edit, they had mapped out some rough ideas and sections where they wanted to do something, and then we had conversations about what that might be, and from there, they allowed me to play. For me, motion graphics can\u2019t be a one-off or afterthought. The style you create should live throughout the film and dance in harmony with everything else\u2014from lower thirds to titles to credits. Because Tad and Bob both spent their lives telling stories through photos and video, those elements needed to be the star, and anything I did needed to help punctuate that.\n\nCHALK: \u201cThird Act\u201d is a deeply personal film, and I think originally Tad had seen this project very differently. When he set out to make the film, he wanted to tell the story of Bob Nakamura, an incredible filmmaker and community member. As I started to delve into the footage, I realized Tad had captured this version of the film, but the real story was their relationship, both as father and son, and as filmmakers. As we collaborated as editor and director, it was important for me to show him scenes and footage where his character was strong, so that he could become comfortable with the idea of being more present in the film, all while respecting the space he needed to navigate the emotional journey he was going through with his father and family.\n\nWorking with Travis is always a joy! His motion graphics are the final stitching of the film, and make the visual language cohesive. His work makes the edit sing. I would also like to add that a film like \u201cThird Act\u201d cannot be made without a strong relationship between edit and archival. I have worked before with Alexandra Margolin (archival producer), and we always consult with each other during the edit process. It's a constant give and take between what we have and what we can find to tell the story. Working with an archival producer in a creative capacity helps find the film we are all trying to make, and showing Alex rough scenes so she had an idea of what to look for was pivotal.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nHATFIELD: My favorite part is not so much a scene, but the \u201cwe have a real movie\u201d moment. I think as a director or editor, you get so used to seeing the offline version of a film, with low-res media, placeholder graphics, rough sound and none of the polish. And while we talked, reviewed, and tweaked graphics, you never really get to see everything in context until everything has been fully onlined, color corrected, and mixed. Those first few full watch throughs, you could see the weights literally being lifted off of their shoulders.\n\nCHALK: One of my favorite moments in the film is when Bob says that he wished he could have made another film about his own father, with \u201cless history and more soul.\u201d I am so jealous of all my friends and colleagues who got to take Bob Nakamura\u2019s classes at UCLA, and I feel like this nugget of filmmaking info from the Godfather of Asian American media is all I need to keep challenging myself to be a better filmmaker. Less history, more soul! Thanks, Bob!\n\nDescribe your favorite piece or component of the project. How did it come together and how did you achieve it?\n\nHATFIELD: My favorite part of the motion graphics is the depth of field. Just playing with the camera and lighting to take a bunch of two-dimensional elements and make them look and feel real. By using real life inspiration like Tad\u2019s bedroom or Bob\u2019s office, we placed photos in places that felt organic to their environments and even hid a couple Easter eggs that only Tad and Bob would notice. We also scanned documents with Bob\u2019s handwriting to create the title and lower thirds.\n\nCHALK: My favorite component of the film was also one of the most difficult to achieve. I really like how the idea of a multi-generational story now plays out, from Jichan (Tad\u2019s grandfather), Bob, Tad, all the way to Prince (Tad\u2019s son). I think it is a theme that speaks to both the joy of family and pain of intergenerational trauma in the Japanese-American community. The challenge was interweaving both archival and present-day footage where all four characters' relationships were explored. I\u2019m hoping the balance was achieved and audiences are moved by the ups and downs.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them? Was there any 3D work? If so, how did you accomplish it?\n\nHATFIELD: The biggest challenge on any project is always time. For the motion graphics, I created a processing-heavy environment by building everything in 3D environments inside of After Effects that used a camera to move around in space with depth of field, to tell the story. While I have a fast machine, sometimes a simple scene can take a day to execute to get it looking the way I want. This film was finished in 4K, so that added another level to processing and rendering. I would often do my first iteration of an idea in HD and then use a script to scale my composition to 4K before rendering.\n\nCHALK: For me, I think one of the challenges was the vast amount of both shot footage and archival. We had all of Bob\u2019s films from his archive, thousands of photos, and all of the family video archival he had shot over the years\u2014literally a life\u2019s work, both professionally and personally. Keeping a handle on everything was challenging, but working in Productions meant that the archival team could create projects for me, cross-referencing archival along the way. Project files were created by decade, by character, by theme, by scene, etc., and photos/video files could live in several. This was a great way for me to find everything.\n\nHATFIELD: This entire production used Adobe from beginning to end. All editorial was done in Premiere Pro, all VFX, compositing and motion graphics were done in After Effects, and all typesetting, photo editing and design was done in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I also used a slew of AE scripts I have collected and perfected over the years to help expedite the process.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro or After Effects, what would it be?\n\nHATFIELD: I think most people would say to learn things that help you become faster/more proficient in the software, but really the biggest tip is learning the language and science behind everything. The better you understand how and why things work, the easier it is to find solutions to what you are trying to create. We are storytellers, and the software is just a conduit that brings our ideas to life.\n\nCHALK: Find the tools that work for you and your way of approaching things. I personally like the versatility of Premiere Pro. When I work with another editor, I often realize that we end up with the same result, but our way to get there is different; we use different layouts, different shortcuts, different editing tools. Personalize your space to support how your creative juices flow.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nHATFIELD: I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with many great artists, designers and creatives over my career, and each one of them has left a mark on who I am as a creative.\n\nCHALK: It takes a village! I have learned something from every person who has helped me along the way and I try to continue to be inspired by watching and reading works old and new. When I am stuck though with story (this is a lot in the life of a documentary editor), I often turn to \u201cInto The Woods\u201d by John Yorke.\n\nWhat\u2019s the toughest thing you\u2019ve had to face in your career and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for people aspiring to get into the motion graphics space?\n\nHATFIELD: The most important thing I\u2019ve ever learned is to never stop learning. Never believe that you are the best at anything and always strive to learn or do something new. Since I began in this industry, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time creating things just to learn how to do them, and what I\u2019ve found is those same ideas that started as an idea to play with, end up making it into my work somewhere down the line.\n\nCHALK: Working in independent documentaries, it\u2019s really tough to see fantastic projects take years to find funding and actually get made. Sometimes I\u2019m cutting a sample or scenes, and I know deep down the film will be groundbreaking, but I won\u2019t be able to come back to it for maybe a year or more while the filmmaker fights for funding. Keep working on building community, finding other models to produce films, and support fellow filmmakers!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nHATFIELD: I do most of my work from my home office. Everything is powered by my Mac Studio. I use two monitors for workspace, a broadcast monitor for color accuracy, a 4K display for resolution monitoring, and an iPad for communication and email. Also featured is a Wacom Tablet and Monogram Creative Console for quicker navigation in apps.\n\nImage Source: Travis Hatfield\n\nCHALK: Currently, I do a lot of work from home with a great monitor and a big TV for playback. I\u2019m on a souped-up Macbook Pro, which allows me to just unplug and shift to an office space when meetings or in-person edit sessions need to happen. I love the black-out blinds in my office. The daytime light is great so it's easy to get some vitamin D, and then I can just pull it down again if I need the dark. What I hate? CABLES.",

            "content": "APQC While many organizations are setting ambitious environmental goals, relatively few expect to actually meet them. Based on recent research with 1,700 global participants, APQC found that only 45% of respondents expect to meet or exceed their climate-related targets. About another quarter of respondents have a complete roadmap but only \u2018hope\u2019 to achieve it. The remaining respondents are uncertain if they will meet their environmental goals, or in some cases, don\u2019t have any goals or a complete roadmap.\n\nOrganizations are not necessarily struggling with buy-in for environmental goals. In fact, we found that the opposite is true. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (72%) consider their environmental objectives to be very or extremely important. If the challenge isn\u2019t one of enthusiasm, what\u2019s driving a lack of confidence in the ability to hit climate-related goals?\n\nIn this article, we review three common roadblocks that often prevent organizations from achieving their environmental objectives. Along the way, we share strategies and approaches that leading organizations have found to meet these challenges.\n\nRoadblock 1: Too Many Measures\n\nMany organizations are being swamped by the number of environmental measures they are trying to track and report. At the median, we found that organizations report 50 environmental metrics on an annual basis. At the 75th percentile, organizations report on as many as 75 environmental metrics annually, whereas organizations at the 25th percentile report 40 environmental metrics per year.\n\n50 measures\u2014just for environmental purposes\u2014is a lot to ask leaders to track and potentially act on. We recommend choosing a single KPI per process or objective, which is supported by no more than seven support indicators used to manage and monitor performance. Ten measures or fewer are usually sufficient for a dashboard.\n\nMost organizations use five typical selection criteria for measure selection, which can also apply to environmental measures:\n\nReliability \u2014can we consistently gather inputs for this measure?\n\n\u2014can we consistently gather inputs for this measure? Impact \u2014does the measure link directly to organizational goals?\n\nTrends \u2014can we track trends over time?\n\nEase \u2014how easy (or difficult) is it to access and analyze the data?\n\nFamiliarity \u2014is this a measure we have used historically, or is it commonly used in our industry?\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with too many environmental measures, work through these questions with your stakeholders to narrow down to a smaller but more impactful set of measures.\n\nRoadblock 2: Measures Lack Context\n\nData for any measure needs context. Without it, organizations risk either reacting too quickly to data or not reacting at all when they urgently need to. Providing context means looking at performance over time, between peer groups, and in light of external factors that affect the data. For example, an organization\u2019s industry, size, and location can all play a meaningful role in shaping what its environmental metrics look like.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most common climate-related topic that organizations include in their environmental reporting, is a good example of a measure that often lacks context. While 93% of respondents include this measure, only 55% report on the intensity of their GHG emissions. GHG emissions intensity expresses the amount of GHG emissions per unit of activity, output, or any other organization-specific metric. In combination with an organization\u2019s absolute GHG emissions, measuring GHG emissions intensity helps to contextualize the organization\u2019s efficiency, including in relation to other organizations.\n\nRoadblock 3: Measures Lack Targets\n\nSetting targets for measures helps ensure that organizations are tracking progress over time and working to take corrective action if needed. When measures lack targets, they are less actionable, their relevance is less clear, and it\u2019s easier for them to clutter up a dashboard without providing meaningful intelligence.\n\nWhile measures need targets, organizations won\u2019t be able to meet those targets without creating accountability and ownership for the key players involved. Leading organizations create this accountability through practices like creating a public-facing roadmap for reaching net zero emissions (i.e., having an equal balance of carbon emitted versus sequestered or offset) and by linking elements of compensation for key employees to achieving strategic environmental goals.\n\nWhile some supply chain organizations are on the right track, many still have an opportunity to instill more accountability for hitting environmental targets. For example, we found that while 72% of organizations publish their target year for achieving net zero emissions, only 50% share their roadmap for how to get there.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nWhile most organizations recognize the importance of achieving their environmental goals, many are struggling with roadblocks related to having too many measures, providing context for making measures actionable, or setting meaningful targets. Any one of these roadblocks is enough to make it more difficult for organizations to achieve their environmental goals.\n\nTo avoid these roadblocks, it\u2019s important to:\n\nWork with stakeholders to identify the most relevant and impactful performance measures\n\nProvide decision makers with context for interpreting the significance of environmental data\n\nIncrease visibility and accountability for environmental targets through approaches like creating a publicly available roadmap\n\nThese practices don\u2019t guarantee success at meeting environmental goals, but they definitely help remove some of the biggest and most longstanding obstacles.",

            "content": "Traditional data center architectures cannot support the scale and complexity of modern AI workloads. To keep pace with unprecedented training and inference compute demands, the industry requires innovative physical layer solutions, including energy-efficient, high-performing hardware and advanced cooling techniques.\n\nAI Data Center Energy Consumption and Cooling Solutions\n\nAI data centers use powerful GPUs to create large language models (LLMs) through training and inference. Training adjusts the model\u2019s parameters for better pattern recognition, while inference uses the trained model to make predictions. Due to the complexity and high-power consumption of building LLMs, AI data centers use much more energy than traditional data centers. For example, while standard enterprise rack power density increased from about 5 kW to 8-10 kW between 2017 and 2022, modern AI racks start at around 15-20 kW, with high-performance AI racks reaching 30-50 kW (some exceptional cases reach around 200 kW).\n\nThe immense power consumption also generates substantial heat, necessitating advanced cooling solutions. Traditional air-cooling methods prove insufficient for high-density AI data center environments. As a result, advanced thermal management techniques have become more prevalent, including direct-to-chip cooling \u2013 managing heat loads exceeding 100 kW per rack \u2013 and immersion cooling. Although immersion cooling offers significant potential, the method faces environmental and equipment compatibility challenges. Despite these issues, immersion cooling effectively cools high-temperature AI data centers and may yet see wider adoption.\n\nPhysical Space and Network Topologies\n\nAI data centers must expand to accommodate the modern, specialized hardware and cooling systems required for optimal performance. Future projects, such as Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s Stargate facility, indicate power requirements of several gigawatts, with a footprint potentially spanning hundreds of acres. This trend in growing AI data center footprints underscores the need for scalable, efficient network topologies.\n\nNetwork topology choice is central to efficient data flow. Two such examples include Clos and torus topologies. Clos topologies provide non-blocking, high-bandwidth connectivity, minimizing congestion for effective data transfer, while torus topologies offer low-latency communication between nodes, enhancing performance and scalability. Many other topologies offer specific networking solutions. Operators often deploy hybrid topologies to support modern AI clusters.\n\nThe Backend and Frontend Networks\n\nTo optimize data flow and processing efficiency, AI data centers require a distinct, purpose-designed frontend network (FENW) and backend network (BENW). The FENW connects every node to orchestrate traffic and telemetry. Set up correctly, the FENW facilitates seamless data access, integration, and efficient communication across the network. The BENW connects each accelerator, enabling components to share model update information during training. Efficient BENWs create low-latency, high-speed memory-sharing environments.\n\nScalability and Fault Tolerance\n\nAs detailed in our recent white paper, a well-architected Clos network can support thousands to hundreds of thousands of endpoints. Operators achieve this extensive connectivity by incorporating additional leaf and spine switches into the network. Clos architectures enhance fault tolerance and redundancy, ensuring continuous network performance even if individual components fail.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a little deeper. For instance, a Clos topology designed to support 131,072 endpoints would require 5,120 switches and 131,072 optical links. The approximate power consumption for such a network would equal 9,646 kW, highlighting the significant energy demands of large-scale AI workloads.\n\nInnovative Connectivity Solutions\n\nThe high-density connections per rack in AI/Machine Learning (ML) servers and switches necessitate advanced connector solutions. Multi-fiber MPO connectors and next-generation very high-density connectors, such as MMC and SN-MT (next-generation form factors for 400G and 800G connectivity), are emerging in the context of the broader data center market, with growing wider adoption in hyperscale environments. These connectors support high-speed, reliable connectivity, essential for maintaining data integrity and optimizing performance.\n\nDue to factors such as high bandwidth and resistance to electromagnetic interference, optical fiber cables are the preferred choice for AI data centers. Proper cable management is crucial for expedited and simplified troubleshooting.\n\nThe Future of AI Data Centers\n\nThe AI/ML landscape is evolving. To remain competitive, advanced AI data centers must invest in high-performance, energy-efficient AI hardware, optical fiber solutions, and advanced cooling methods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe growing demand for AI and ML technologies has vastly transformed modern data center infrastructures. While adjustments to keep up with demand may have at first been seen as a technical necessity, AI\u2019s unstoppable momentum arguably creates a strategic imperative to innovate today or fall by the wayside tomorrow.\n\nBy embracing advanced networking solutions and innovative physical layer technologies, data center operators can confidently and quickly achieve the performance, scalability, and efficiency required to drive the next generation of AI innovations. One thing is clear: the shift towards newer AI technologies and advanced AI data center networking represents a pivotal opportunity for industry leaders to invest in future operations and remain at the forefront of the technological advancements customers demand.",

            "content": "Sundance 2025: Behind the Scenes with the Editor of \u201cBunnyLovr\u201d\n\nImage Source: Sundance Institute\n\nKatarina Zhu\u2019s debut feature \u201cBunnylovr\u201d premieres at Sundance on January 25th. Directed by, written by, and starring Zhu and edited by Stephania Dulowski (\u201cTendaberry\u201d), the film follows a drifting Chinese American cam girl, Rebecca, struggling to navigate an increasingly toxic relationship with one of her clients while rekindling her relationship with her dying estranged father.\n\nZhu offers a vulnerable performance as Rebecca, who is both yearning for connection and vigilant about maintaining her emotional and physical safety, while co-producer Rachel Sennott is abrasively funny as Rebecca\u2019s more grounded best friend.\n\nWe sat down with Dulowski for an inside look at how she used Premiere Pro and Frame.io to craft a story that offers a nuanced, nonjudgmental approach to sex work, while also raising important questions about the commodification of intimacy and fragmentation of family. Working closely with Zhu and the rest of the creative team, Dulowski said Frame.io\u2019s integration with Premiere Pro was crucial to the team\u2019s collaborative workflow: \u201cUsing the \u2018Review with Frame.io\u2019 feature within Premiere Pro was especially helpful as I could ingest everyone\u2019s comments on the exact frame they left their notes on. It\u2019s fantastic and a game changer for remote collaboration.\u201d\n\nRead on for a behind-the-scenes look at editing \u201cBunnyLovr.\u201d\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nNeon Heart Productions, one of the production companies behind \u201cBunnylovr,\u201d recommended me to edit the film after our collaboration on \u201cTendaberry,\u201d which premiered at Sundance 2024 in the NEXT Category. \u201cTendaberry\u201d was a multiyear editorial process with a shifting script, and Neon Heart often praised my ability to navigate its complexities, which made their recommendation for \u201cBunnylovr\u201d especially meaningful. Additionally, Radish, another production company involved in the film, strongly advocated for me as well. There was a lot of buzz in NYC around \u201cBunnylovr,\u201d which made me super excited when I joined the team.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nI found out \u201cBunnylovr\u201d got into Sundance when I walked into the edit bay at Exile Edit in NYC (the commercial shop I\u2019m represented by that graciously let us use their edit bays for the film) and Katarina Zhu, the director, greeted me with the news and a bouquet of flowers. Coincidentally, it was also our picture lock day, which made it even more special to complete the edit knowing it would premiere at Sundance in just over two months. This marks my second consecutive year having a feature film premiere at the festival, and the moment felt surreal both times\u2014I was just more stunned getting in for the second year in a row!\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nWhen I begin a project, I collaborate closely with the assistant editor to develop a strategy for breaking down the footage and organizing the scenes in a way that best suits the workflow. I prefer fewer sequences per scene, otherwise, I\u2019m spending time just clicking through sequences. All my selects go into new sequences along with the different ways I can assemble the scene. These little scene assemblies show the director some of the best takes and how the scene may come together. I also keep the breakdown sequences close because there are multiple times throughout the edit process where the director and I will screen all the performances again when we know how a scene will work, to ensure we chose the best takes. It becomes too cumbersome to click through lots of different sequences when I\u2019m editing so an organized workspace is essential to my focus during editing a film.\n\nI also take time to read the script multiple times to fully understand the story\u2019s intent and underlying themes. This preparation ensures that when I screen all the footage, I can make thoughtful creative choices that align with the director\u2019s vision.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes in \u201cBunnylovr\u201d is also the longest and serves as a pivotal moment in the story. It was one of the first scenes we assembled, and it worked so well initially that we left it untouched for a long time. During fine cutting, we focused on building the tension between the two characters, layering in subtle microexpressions and sound design to shift the tone from lighthearted to deeply unsettling. I love this scene because it challenged us to make nuanced decisions, gradually transforming the mood over its duration. It\u2019s a complex and rewarding sequence that significantly impacts the story and the main character\u2019s journey.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for this film was the incredibly tight timeline. The production team was determined to submit the film to Sundance, which meant we needed a full assembly of the film by the end of the third week of editing\u2014 incredibly fast for any feature-length project. We ultimately hit this goal, but it required a very organized project and understanding of the director\u2019s vision before I began editing.\n\nI edited Bunnylovr in Premiere Pro using Productions to keep my project moving fast. We\u2019d used Frame.io daily to post cuts for reviews and offload the picture lock edit with notes to all the finishing departments. I also used Speech to Text to help me find specific lines from characters within their lengthy monologues.\n\nWe shared roughcuts with the producers almost daily on Frame.io. Using the \u2018Review with Frame.io\u2019 feature within Premiere Pro was especially helpful as I could ingest everyone\u2019s comments on the exact frame they left their notes on. This helped Katarina and I take into account everyone\u2019s notes while actively re-editing scenes. The comments would stick to the scenes they were on even though the timeline was shifting. It\u2019s fantastic and a game changer for remote collaboration!\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nAlways create hotkeys for your shortcuts! Cutting down the time it takes to perform an action will give you more energy and time to focus on the creative side of editing. My favorite hotkey on this project was \u2018close gap,\u2019 which the director actually showed me.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nWhen editing, I often think of Walter Murch\u2019s \u201cIn The Blink of An Eye.\u201d Specifically, how he says performance and story always are more important than continuity. So many times you can be a little nervous that the viewer will catch inconsistencies in production, but I like to remind myself that if the story is working, the viewer is engaged and the inconsistencies fall to the background.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this before, but burnout creeps up quicker every year. It\u2019s important to take care of yourself on long projects that require a lot of stamina.\n\nMy advice to aspiring film editors is to be a part of an editorial community. Post-production can be very isolating since teams are smaller and it can feel like you\u2019re severed from the rest of the production. It\u2019s so rewarding for me to spend time talking and sharing with other editors about our experiences.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nImage Source: Stephania Dulowski Image Source: Stephania Dulowski\n\nMy favorite thing about my workstation is my vertical mouse which helps prevent pain in my arm by keeping it in a natural position. This helps when editing 8-10 hours a day 5-7 days a week. I\u2019m never going back to a regular mouse!",

The black-and-white cinematography and eerie soundtrack create a dark atmosphere in which Vinita must drop her snarky exterior and expose her true fear and vulnerability.\n\nBecause the film was shot over a long period of time, Boothby started the edit with only 50% of the film shot. Using Premiere Pro and After Effects, he was able to create entire scenes in post that they did not have footage for, including a key foreshadowing moment: \u201c[The scene] has a big impact on how the climax plays, and it was a solution completely built in the edit and VFX.\u201d\n\nRead on for more from Boothby on the making of \u201cDidn\u2019t Die,\u201d premiering at Sundance on January 28th.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nMeera and her husband Paul have been close friends for almost a decade. We have daughters the same age, and even our dogs are friends. We had been looking for opportunities to work together, so when they started making this film two years ago, I jumped at the chance.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nMy wife Erica, who produced the film, had just gotten back from a trip, and we were eating with our daughter when Meera called us and asked to put the call on speaker. Now, keep in mind that we had submitted to Sundance last year and hadn't gotten in, but had continued to refine the film and never premiered it\u2014so, my expectations were low after that first rejection. When she told us, we just absolutely flipped, and it took weeks to come to terms with it mentally.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nThis is where I talk about how organized I am, right? Hahaha. Ok, I AM organized, but I don't have an assistant, so I'm only as organized as I need to be to not slow myself down. Over time, I've also gotten in the habit of working in essentially a standard Premiere Pro edit workspace, which has made it faster and easier to switch machines without having to migrate settings. Therefore, my setup is quite simple and straightforward. One major thing I do at the beginning of a project is go through all the footage and pull my selects, then STOP and take a break so I can let what I've seen swim around in my head. It's a crucial step for me to picture what I'm going to do in my mind away from the computer before I actually sit down and do it.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nMy favorite scene is pretty much the most innocuous interstitial scene imaginable, which I'm going to try to describe without spoilers because it directly connects to the climax of the film. Essentially, there was an element of the climax that wasn't working, and it really needed a moment earlier in the film to foreshadow what was happening. The problem was, we never shot that foreshadowing scene, so we didn't have any footage for it. After agonizing over it, I finally realized I could use shots from a bunch of other unrelated scenes and combine them with a small amount of VFX to make the foreshadowing scene we needed. I pitched the idea to Meera and she approved it. We tried it, and it totally works! It has a big impact on how the climax plays, and it was a solution completely built in the edit and VFX. Check the movie out and see if you can guess which scene it is (you can't).\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nI'd say the biggest challenge with this film was that it was shot piecemeal over time. When we started the cut, we only had about 50% of the film shot. So, there were entire scenes marked with placeholders, and there were also half-shot scenes that we cut with placeholder text describing what we wanted the missing shots to be. Weirdly, I feel like the movie actually ended up better because of this, mostly due to Meera's good choices. She was able to look at what we had made and design the missing scenes and shots to be better and convey more information than they might have originally.\n\nI used Premiere Pro and After Effects, plus a little Illustrator. Paul, the DP of the film, was also the VFX supervisor and primary artist, and I helped with some of the VFX workload. I did the title and credits animations as well, so that was the primary use for After Effects. I've worked in Adobe Creative Cloud for over a decade, so it was a no-brainer to use it for this project.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nOne thing I use all the time and find extremely useful is the speed change hotkey (\u2318+R). I do use it for speed changes, but more often I use it to find out the length of clips. And if I need to go one step further and measure the length of entire sections or groups of shots, I'll lay a null object, adjustment layer, or color matte over the section in question, then \u2318+R to instantly see the exact length.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nIt's not a person but I actually get a lot of creative inspiration from animation. Animation is the most broken-down version of action over time, and the principles apply across any filmmaking process, but especially in editing. It inspires me in many ways, but one way is using the principles to manipulate shots as much as I need to create the perfect timing, including speed-changing tiny fractions of shots in an essentially invisible way.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nI'd say the toughest thing has been the need to make money and prioritize that over creative satisfaction at many, many points. It's a situation that so many people are in, and all I can say is find time to do things that satisfy you, even in tiny ways. If it means working on meaningful projects at night, or over lunch\u2014even if you just do it once a week\u2014it can go a long way. I currently have a full-time job making corporate videos, and I edited this film at night and on the weekends.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nI had a lovely little home office\u2014I've always loved working from home\u2014and had filled it with all kinds of inspiration in the form of graphic novels, films, and art. Unfortunately, we just lost our home in the Eaton fire [in Los Angeles], so that workspace and the things in it are gone. But, I'm continuing to work remotely (we saved my computer, the movie, and other important hard drives, thankfully). Once we eventually rebuild, we'll make a new home office and start the collection again!",

            "content": "CRC | \u00a9 Sebastian Kaulitzki \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThe use of a tumor-informed, personalized circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay affected adjuvant treatment decisions in 16.3% of cases among patients with stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC), according to final analysis data from the observational BESPOKE CRC (NCT04264702) subcohort presented at the 2025 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.\n\nOf those treatment changes, 59.9% resulted in chemotherapy treatment de-escalation and 35.7% resulted in chemotherapy intensification\u2013\u20134.4% of subsequent therapy decisions were not available. Notably, 13.2% of patients had metastatic disease diagnosed as a result of a positive postoperative ctDNA test.\n\nOf the 83.7% of physicians who said the ctDNA result did not affect their treatment decision, 83.8% said it did make them feel more comfortable with their prior planned treatment vs 16.1% who claimed it did not affect their comfort level.\n\n\u201cIn the largest multicenter ctDNA study reported in the United States, postoperative ctDNA testing led to a change in adjuvant management for 1 out of 6 patients and validated the adjuvant plan for most patients,\u201d Purvi K. Shah, MD, lead study author and medical oncologist at Virginia Cancer Institute in Richmond, stated in a presentation of the data.\n\nThe current standard of care for patients with surgically resected, high-risk, stage II/III CRC is 3 to 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, only a subset of these patients will derive benefit from this treatment.\n\nBESPOKE CRC is a multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluating whether Natera\u2019s Signatera\u2014a tumor-informed, personalized ctDNA assay\u2014could inform adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making for patients with pathologic stage II/III CRC.\n\n\u201cIn this prospective, observational study, ctDNA was collected from 1780 patients with surgically resected, stage II/III CRC at varying time points,\u201d Shah explained. \u201cThe first time point, called the MRD time point, was collected 2 to 6 weeks after resection, and thereafter, collections occurred at 2, 4, and 6 months, and then every 3 months up to 24 months after resection. The surveillance time point collection started at 6 months or later from surgical resection. Treating oncologists received the results of the tests and were allowed to treat patients at their discretion per standard-of-care guidelines. They were prospectively surveyed at predetermined time points.\u201d\n\nOf the 1780 patients who were enrolled, 614 were excluded, leaving 1166 for inclusion in the final analysis. A total of 694 were included in the adjuvant chemotherapy cohort, and 472 were included in the observation cohort.\n\nBaseline characteristics of the final analysis study population revealed that the median age was 61.8 years (range, 22-94) and most patients were male (56.7%). Most patients had pathologic stage III disease (55.7%), were under the age of 65 (57.8%), White (72.4%), and not Hispanic or Latino (82.0%). Most patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (63.7%), received adjuvant chemotherapy (59.5%), and did not experience recurrence (83.9%).\n\nNotably, at the MRD time point, 7.54% (95% CI, 5.57%-10.15%) of patients with stage II disease (n = 517) tested positive for MRD vs 28.35% (95% CI, 25.02%-31.94%) of patients with stage III disease (n = 649).\n\nMedian follow-up was 23.9 months (range, 0.5-36.5).\n\nAdditional results illustrated that postoperative ctDNA positivity predicted for inferior disease-free survival (DFS) regardless of whether patients had stage II or III disease. Among patients with stage II disease, the 2-year DFS rate was 45.9% (95% CI, 32.1%-65.8%) in those with ctDNA positivity vs 91.8% (95% CI, not evaluable [NE]-NE) in those with ctDNA negativity at the MRD time point (HR, 11.23; 95% CI, 6.43-19.62; P <.0001). For patients with stage III disease, the 2-year DFS rates were 35.5% (95% CI, 28.6%-44.2%) and 87.4% (95% CI, 83.8%-91.1%) in those with positive and negative ctDNA, respectively (HR, 8.33; 95% CI, 5.89-11.78; P <.0001).\n\nMoreover, positive ctDNA at the first surveillance time point was associated with inferior DFS (HR, 20.63; 95% CI, 14.37-29.61; P <.0001). Investigators also conducted a time-dependent analysis for DFS during the surveillance period and showed that patients who became positive at any time point during surveillance had a 26.4-higher hazard of recurrence vs those who remained ctDNA negative (95% CI, 21.6-32.4; P <.0001).\n\nFurthermore, ctDNA clearance during and after adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved DFS, with hazard ratios of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29-0.64; P <.0001) and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.19-0.52; P <.0001) at months 3 and 6, respectively. \u201cThis reflects the test\u2019s ability in demonstrating potential effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy,\u201d Shah said.\n\nThe rates of ctDNA clearance by week 12, 20, month 6, and overall in patients with MRD positivity (n = 160) were 49.44% (95% CI, 42.2%-56.7%), 67.22% (95% CI, 60.1%-73.7%), 73.33% (95% CI, 66.4%-79.3%), and 75.56% (95% CI, 68.8%-81.3%), respectively.\n\nShah went on to explain that of the 188 patients whose disease recurred, 86% had a prior positive Signatera test. Of these, 30% of patients underwent metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), the most common of which was surgery in 81.04% of cases.\n\n\u201cThis underscores the value of following ctDNA serially in the surveillance setting, not only as a prognostic marker, but for its potential ability to be associated with a higher rate of MDT compared to historical data, potentially giving these patients a shot at a cure,\u201d Shah said.\n\nWith regard to recurrence, Shah stated, \u201cThe ctDNA test had a high sensitivity in detecting recurrences across a variety of different anatomical sites. The liver was the most common site of metastases and had the highest sensitivity of 96%. However, low-shedding sites such as the peritoneum and lung also had sensitivities as high as 79% and 76%, respectively. Although bone and abdominal wall recurrences had a high sensitivity of 100%, I would use caution in drawing inferences, since the actual number of occurrences in those sites were extremely small.\u201d\n\nFinally, the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients was assessed separately and showed a benefit evident only in MRD-positive patients. The 2-year DFS rates in MRD-positive patients were 40.3% (95% CI, 33.3%-48.9%) and 24.7% (95% CI, 13.2%-46.3%) with adjuvant chemotherapy and observation, respectively (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.77; P =.0008). Among MRD-negative patients, the 2-year DFS rates were 89.7% (95% CI, 86.7%-92.9%) and 89.5% (95% CI, 86.2%-92.9%) with adjuvant chemotherapy and observation, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.59-1.45; P =.0287).\n\n\u201cThis highlights another potential value of utilizing a positive ctDNA test to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy,\u201d Shah stated.\n\nDisclosures: Dr Shah shared no disclosures.\n\nReference\n\nShah P, Aushev V, Ensor J, et al.

No one wants to buy a blue sweater and get a green one instead.\n\nColor correcting isn\u2019t a complex task. It can be done relatively easily provided you have the right software\u2014like Adobe Lightroom\u2014and integrate it into your product photography workflow.\n\nThere are steps you can take during your photoshoot, like using a gray card to set white balance to help capture accurate color. But no matter how careful you are or how beautiful your shot is, there are still improvements that can be made in post-production.\n\nWhat is Adobe Lightroom?\n\nProduct photography begins under the camera, but it\u2019s finished in post-production. Everyone\u2019s heard of Adobe Photoshop, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all when it comes to processing product images.\n\nFor some jobs, Adobe Photoshop is unnecessarily complex: using Photoshop to bulk color correct images from a shoot is like programming a supercomputer to split a restaurant check when your phone\u2019s calculator (Lightroom) is already on hand.\n\nAdobe Lightroom is a photo editing software for DIY (do it yourself), budget-conscious product photographers. It can be used to both streamline your workflow during the shoot and to edit images in bulk afterward.\n\nAdobe Lightroom\u2019s multiple features and post-production editing tools\n\nIt comes with some powerful post-production features:\n\nNondestructive editing. Every image edit Lightroom makes can be reversed. It retains your original images and keeps a record of your edits, then applies them when you export your images. You can come back minutes, hours, days, months, or years later and reverse the edits. That\u2019s valuable for peace of mind and a key difference from Photoshop.\n\nEvery image edit Lightroom makes can be reversed.

In essence, Lightroom retains your original images and keeps a record of your edits, then applies them when you export your images. You can come back minutes, hours, days, months, or years later and reverse the edits. That\u2019s valuable peace-of-mind and a key difference from Photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop and Lightroom are complementary programs so they're available as a bundle for $9.99 a month in the Creative Cloud Photography plan.\n\n1. Organize your images\n\nLightroom can work with RAW images straight from your camera. Organize your images by shoot and put all your RAW files from a shoot into a single folder on your computer.\n\nOrganize by shoot, because lighting conditions will be similar, if not identical. That means the adjustments you\u2019ll need to make will be similar too, allowing batch processing.\n\n2. Import your images\n\nImport all your images from a folder into a session. Watch this video to see how, or follow the step-by-step instructions underneath. Import your image folder into Adobe Lightroom for batch processing.\n\nStep-by-step instructions:\n\nChoose File > Import Photos And Video.\n\nUse the Source panel to find the image folder.\n\nMake sure the Add button is selected. Press the Select All button.\n\nClick Import.\n\nOnce all your images are imported into the catalog, you can begin adjusting.\n\n3. Adjust an image\n\nAt the top right of the frame, you will see a row of buttons: Library, Develop, Map, Book, Slideshow, Print, and Web.\n\nUse Develop in Adobe Lightroom to color correct a single image.\n\nYou\u2019ll be in the library after importing. Select an image from the library. Use this single image to perform adjustments, and then apply those adjustments to all other images.\n\nAfter selecting an image, click over to Develop to make your adjustments. You should see a panel on the right side with a bunch of tabs. Each of those is a toolbox you can use to make edits. The primary tab, and the one used here, is named Basics.\n\nColor correction uses the White Balance, Exposure, and Contrast tools.\n\nWhite Balance (\u201cWB\u201d), Exposure, and Contrast are the most important color correction tools.\n\nWhite Balance\n\nClick the dropper tool up in the top left of the Basics tab and drag it over the image to a spot that should be gray. Click that spot and Lightroom will automatically white balance your image. If you\u2019re still not quite happy, play with the Temp and Tint options until you find the sweet spot.\n\nExposure\n\nYou can use this tool to brighten or darken your image. Don\u2019t feel obligated to use it just because it\u2019s there. If your shoot went well, you may not need any adjusting.\n\nContrast\n\nContrast is the go-to tool for making details stand out. Adjust it to accentuate light and dark.\n\n4. Sync adjustments to all\n\nBatch processing images means you can apply the same preset across all images from your shoot.\n\nSelect the rest of your images from the film strip at the bottom of the screen. Click the Sync button at the bottom right of the Tools panel. From the pop-up window, select the adjustments (typically all of them) you want to apply to the rest of your images. Click Synchronize.\n\nWatch as Lightroom moves through your images, performing adjustments on each image as it goes.\n\n5. Select your favorites\n\nUse Adobe Lightroom\u2019s five-star rating system to select the best product images.\n\nLightroom has a star rating system that allows you to assign a score from one to five with a click.\n\nGo through your images and mark your favorites with a five-star rating by clicking the fifth star beneath each image.When you\u2019ve rated the batch, sort your catalog by selecting View > Sort > Rating.\n\n6. Export final images\n\nYou\u2019ll want to separate your selections from the rest of the crowd and get them into a format that\u2019s closer to web-ready. To do this, you\u2019ll need to export them into their own folder. Export select processed images from Lightroom into a new folder.\n\nSelect all the five-star images, and from the top menu navigate to File > Export.\n\nA window will open with further options. For the most part, you can stick with the defaults, but pay close attention to a few of them:\n\nExport location, file name, and file settings are important to an organized workflow.\n\nExport location, file name, and file settings are important to an organized photography workflow.\n\n\n\nExport to: Create a new folder within the same folder that contains your RAW images and name it something descriptive, like \u201cColor Corrected\u201d or \u201cFinal.\u201d File naming: Create a naming scheme for your image files that will help you organize them in the future, like style numbers. Lightroom allows you to customize file names in a variety of ways. File settings:\n\nImage format: You\u2019re almost certainly not going to want to stay in RAW format, but this depends a bit on your workflow. If you plan to perform further individual edits in Photoshop, you may want to export your images as a PSD or TIFF. To save disk space, particularly if you\u2019re headed to the web soon, it\u2019s JPEG time.\n\nYou\u2019re almost certainly not going to want to stay in RAW format, but this depends a bit on your workflow. If you plan to perform further individual edits in Photoshop, you may want to export your images as a PSD or TIFF. To save disk space, particularly if you\u2019re headed to the web soon, it\u2019s JPEG time. Color space: Stick with sRGB for the web. It\u2019s optimal for ecommerce product photos.\n\nMake your settings selections and press the Export button. Voila! Your images have been color corrected.\n\nHow to tether, capture, and edit images with Lightroom\n\nTethering allows you to take a photo and edit it right away. You can see your photo immediately on screen, but you can also create a preset that will perform adjustments in real time as you shoot.\n\nHere\u2019s how to take advantage of this time-saving Lightroom feature:\n\nOpen Lightroom and Catalog. Open an existing Lightroom catalog or create a new one from inside the app. Tether your camera and computer. Connect your camera to your computer with a USB cord. Once it\u2019s connected, go to File > Tethered Capture > Start Tethered Capture. You can create a new folder for these images. Shoot. You\u2019ll see a capture strip in your new catalog library which is where you can see all your camera\u2019s settings. When you\u2019re happy with your ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, you can take photos directly from your computer to avoid camera shake.\n\nCreate and use a preset. Take a few shots until you have one you\u2019re happy with. Open the Develop tab and make and save your desired adjustments as a \u201cpreset\u201d that you can apply to future photos in your shoot. Export your chosen photos. In the library, review and rate your images before selecting your final batch. Click Export in either the file dropdown menu or by right-clicking anywhere on the image.\n\nBest product photography editing tips for Adobe Lightroom\n\nReady to get started with Lightroom for product photography? Use our photo editing tips to make the most of the tool.\n\n1. Use the Histogram to adjust exposure and tones\n\nThe Histogram will show you the exposure of your image through a density in pixels. One end of the axis shows white and the other shows black\u2014shades of gray are in between.\n\nIf there is a high density of pixels at one end, it means your image is either very dark or very light. This could indicate over- or under-exposure that you can edit out in post production or change the settings on your camera. You can experiment with the density of pixels in the Histogram by clicking around, which will automatically adjust the exposure of your pics.\n\nHow the Histogram works in Lightroom.\n\n2. Take photos through your computer\n\nLightroom\u2019s Tethering feature lets you avoid the dreaded camera shake by taking photos directly through your computer. You can choose your camera settings on your device before you begin, but snap your shots straight from your desktop. Not only does this eliminate any shaking, but it also lets you see what your images will look like on a screen.\n\n3. Use a predesigned preset\n\nIf you\u2019re adept at photography, you can cheat a bit by using premade presets that you can download. You might have to pay $30 or so, but once you have the preset saved in your Lightroom dashboard, you can apply it to all future photographs you take. This means you don\u2019t have to fiddle around with any settings in post production and ensures all your product photos have a cohesive feel.\n\nHow to edit product photos in Lightroom: Go to another level\n\nEditing your photos post-production is critical if you want all your product pics to have the same feel and ensure customers know exactly what they\u2019re getting.\n\nA consistent presentation creates a smooth shopping experience for visitors. Editing or removing image backgrounds and maintaining consistent margins, incorporating natural light, cropping, and alignment are all post-production musts. You can DIY your editing, or you may want to consider using a post-production service.",

            "content": "Sundance 2025: \u201cEndless Cookie\u201d is an animated look at two half-brothers\u2019 complicated relationship\n\nImage Source: Sundance Institute\n\nNine years in the making and told through handcrafted animation, the documentary \u201cEndless Cookie\u201d explores the complex bond between Seth and Pete Scriver, two half brothers\u2014one Indigenous, one white. While traveling from the present in isolated Shamattawa, Canada to bustling 1980s Toronto, the film debates complex issues of race and identity while reflecting on the challenges that come with trying to make a documentary while raising nine kids and a bunch of dogs.\n\n\u201cEndless Cookie\u201d premieres January 25th at the Sundance Film Festival. Before the debut, we got a chance to speak with Seth Scriver, whose animations are the foundation of the film, and editor Sydney Cowper. Seth started animating the film in Flash 8 before upgrading nearly 16 (!) generations of the software to Animate and pairing it with After Effects. Cowper came on six years later to bring the story to life in the edit, using a combination of Premiere Pro, Animate, Audition, Frame.io and Media Encoder. \u201cWe kept our software within the Adobe family to keep our crazy workflow as seamless as possible,\u201dCowper said.\n\nRead on for our conversation with Seth Scriver and Cowper about their creative inspirations, meticulous workflows, and the making of \u201cEndless Cookie.\u201d\n\nSeth, how did you first get into animation? What drew you to it?\n\nSCRIVER: I used to go through the garbage cans of the computer animation class that I wasn't enrolled in and reanimate the projects in there, messing them up, dissecting them, and giving them a bizarre new life.\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind this project? What were you trying to achieve?\n\nSCRIVER: I was inspired to record my brother Pete\u2019s stories. He\u2019s one of the greatest storytellers, and in the end, it turned into a type of family portrait.\n\nSydney, how did you first get involved with this project?\n\nCOWPER: I was working with producer Alex Ordanis on a Netflix project that was starting to wind down, and he needed someone to extract Seth\u2019s animations from Adobe Animate, and the sound edits from Adobe Audition and other platforms, and rebuild everything inside of Premiere Pro to start assembling it into the film. The original plan was for it to be a short-term side project, lasting only a few months, but as we realized the potential of the film, we all firmly committed to the long-term project. I came on board as picture editor for the next three years and worked with Seth and the producers to break the story and bring it to life in the edit.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nSCRIVER: One minute before we got an email saying we got into Sundance, I was praying\u2014no joke. I felt like a crazy person, desperately hoping that we would be accepted into Sundance. I could not believe how fast the results were\u2014I felt great about it! I think it was just a crazy coincidence, but it still made me feel like I was magic.\n\nCOWPER: I was on vacation in Mexico sitting at a little breakfast spot in M\u00e9rida when Alex called me to tell me. I felt very excited, a little bit surprised (I didn\u2019t know we had submitted), and relieved that after years of everyone\u2019s hard work (especially Seth\u2019s), our film was going to get such a great world premiere.\n\nSCRIVER: I was animating this project about nine years ago using an old version of Adobe Flash that my uncle had bought years before that. I believe it was Flash 8\u2014I used to have to export PNGs and then import that into After Effects and then export a video file. But about three years ago, one of my producers, Alex, gave me access to Adobe Creative Cloud. I was hesitant at first, but eventually upgraded 16 generations of Flash to what is now called Animate, and it\u2019s great! I can export directly to high-quality video, and there are a bunch of functions that make it easier to organize my animation. It\u2019s made my life and process much quicker and better.\n\nCOWPER: I used Animate to output Seth\u2019s animations into our 4K masters, then I used Premiere Pro to edit the film, Audition to bring the dialogue edits into Premiere, and then, naturally, I used Media Encoder for all of my outputs. We used Frame.io to distribute cuts to the team for the whole process. We kept our software within the Adobe family to keep our crazy workflow as seamless as possible.\n\nI begin every project by setting up my edit hard drive with a good, organized folder system. Then I create my project, set up my folders within my Premiere Pro project (Assets, Media, Music, SFX etc.), and direct all the project data to be written to my edit hard drive. I simplify all the windows and views to be as minimalist as possible, import my media, and immediately make HD proxies using Premiere\u2019s integrated proxy assistant once everything is imported into my project, then I start editing.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nSCRIVER: I think the interruption of my brother telling a story about how he was stuck in his own trap that he set. In the audio recording, it got interrupted by his son, Antonio, flushing a toilet. It led us to just give in to all the distractions and interruptions that happened in our lives while making the movie.\n\nCOWPER: When I received scenes from Seth, since it\u2019s animated content, there were little to no sound effects\u2014no foley, no ambience\u2014with the exception of a handful of scenes where Seth did add some sound design. In my timeline, it was usually just animation and the dialogue that Seth had animated. I got to build the soundscapes for a lot of the scenes (at least until our post sound team got their very talented hands on the film). There is a hilarious scene where a character climbs a chicken truck and starts rescuing and throwing live chickens into the streets of Kensington Market. I spent so much time placing chicken squawks and clucks. I\u2019ve never been so excited and focused on placing SFX than in that scene, because I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at this ridiculous scene I was editing and how the SFX elevated it.\n\nWhat were some specific challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nSCRIVER: Pete and I live thousands of miles apart. Pete lives way up in the Bush near Hudson's Bay, and I live in Toronto. So, it was hard to travel to see each other. I basically just had to work and save money or apply for grants to travel and see each other and record stories, which was really fun when it happened.\n\nCOWPER: Our biggest challenge was our technical workflow. I was outputting Seth\u2019s animation as our 4K masters directly from Animate and using Premiere Pro to create our offline proxies to edit with. Seth had been working on the project for several years before I came on board and had built the story using audio recordings he took of his family, and he cut together the dialogue first on one platform, then later in Adobe Audition, and then finally directly in his own Premiere Pro project. So, locating the right sound edits of the story, figuring out each different software\u2019s best way of outputting, and then importing the timelines into Premiere Pro while maintaining any of the mixing and effects Seth had used was tough. I\u2019d spend quite a bit of time rebuilding the audio tracks for each scene inside of Premiere Pro to match what Seth had animated to, and then after that point, I could start cutting up and editing the individual scene for story and pacing.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, After Effects, and/or Animate, what would it be?\n\nSCRIVER: I didn't do this in the movie \u201cEndless Cookie,\u201d but I plan to, at some point, export movies from Animate with the outline tool on. It looks interesting, and I want to experiment with that. Experiment and have fun.\n\nCOWPER: If you\u2019re using Premiere Pro as your editing software, and you need to make the offline editorial proxies, don\u2019t bother creating them outside of the project and importing and linking them up. Just bring in your 4K media and use the built-in proxy tool. You can create the proxies within the software. They will automatically link up to your online media, you can edit with your footage while your proxies are being generated and automatically linked for you, and then there\u2019s no onlining at the end of the project. It saves so much time and you can start editing sooner.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nSCRIVER: Lots of friends and family are super inspiring to me\u2014my son, my nieces and nephews, the nog-a-dog family, DIY zines and animations, lowbrow graffiti. My neighborhood where I grew up and still live, Kensington Market/Chinatown, has lots of gems that always inspire interesting and/or funny ideas.\n\nCOWPER: I don\u2019t have any individual who is my creative inspiration. I\u2019ve been inspired by small moments of cinema that I could apply to specific moments in my work, but my choices always come from somewhere within. I was a big book nerd as a kid, and I trained in piano for 12 years, so I pull on both of those things when I\u2019m editing. If I\u2019m stuck on how to edit a scene, I sit down on the couch with my script and read it as if it's a book: whatever/whoever my mind is imagining seeing while I\u2019m reading the script, I write down on the script, if I were in the room with these people, what would I be looking at? I act as if continuity isn\u2019t an issue and do a paper edit of how I would want to see the story without getting caught up with technical stuff. Then, I take the script to my desk and I follow my own paper edit as best as I can. My pacing comes from my years studying music, and every cut I make is based on my internal metronome of the scene as if it's a dance or piece of music.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nSCRIVER: This feature was super-hard because it took so freaking long to animate, mostly by myself, and there was no real reward. I had lots of fun along the way, don't get me wrong, but I had to continually tell myself and force myself to keep at it, work on it, and it\u2019ll be done someday. And here we are nine years later! Many days, it felt like it would never be done. I also had horrible carpal tunnel and could barely work for a certain amount of time, but a friend told me to beat my wrist with stinging nettle, and that cured me. I highly recommend that if anyone is having carpal tunnel or repetitive stress problems.\n\nCOWPER: At a certain point in your career, either when you financially can afford to, or when you\u2019ve had enough experience trying out a lot of different things within your craft, you have to make the decision about what kinds of projects you want to work on. Genres, themes, what length of project you\u2019re best at. You\u2019ll know when to make the call to start saying \u201cno\u201d to projects that don\u2019t sing to you, and try to stick to that calling. You should be honing your skills in that area. You\u2019ll also get hired for those types of jobs if you\u2019re actually doing those types of jobs. I personally think you\u2019ll do your best work on things that you can get emotionally invested in. We are creating stories, characters, and emotions after all, so if you don\u2019t feel it, how do you expect to get your audience to?\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nSCRIVER: I love all the inspiring little bits of stuff around my workstation. It\u2019s a fun, messy, analog version of my Instagram zone.\n\nSeth in his workspace. Image Source: Seth Scriver\n\nCOWPER: I keep a relatively small desk in my work-from-home office to try to avoid clutter and have more room for other things in the space. I have my piano and a spin bike in here that I use to take breaks or reset my nervous system if I\u2019m moving from a stressful scene to a slower scene so that I\u2019m not cutting in the wrong headspace. Lots of plants. My favourite thing is my lack of a computer chair. It allows me to move around freely and pace or shake it out if I need to.",

This week the company announced that Premiere Pro is getting some new AI-powered features. The beta features include a new media intelligence panel that upgrades file search and the ability to translate your video captions into 17 different languages.\n\nOne of the first things you figure out when you start learning how to edit in Premiere is the importance of naming your clips and organizing files in your library, so that you can find specific clips later and avoid those dreaded \"media not found\" error messages. But as anyone who's done that knows, it's a tedious and time-consuming task. That's where the new media intelligence panel can help.\n\nMedia intelligence is a kind of advanced search panel that aims to make it easier to find specific clips. You can still search by file name and location, but media intelligence can recognize certain elements in clips and pull them -- subjects like \"skateboarders\" or technical elements like lens flares, or both, clips of people skateboarding where there's a lens flare. The idea is to make it easier and quicker to find the clips you need, even if they aren't named after the subject or include the keyword you're using to search.\n\nMedia intelligence uses clips' metadata, including shoot date and camera type -- meaning you can get really specific with your searches. It can also highlight sections of longer videos, so if you want one question from a taped interview, you can search for that without having to scrub the whole video searching for that one part.\n\nMedia intelligence runs locally on your computer and doesn't read or store information about your clips. Adobe doesn't train its AI models on its users' content.\n\nYou can now add translated captions to your videos in the Premiere Pro beta app. Adobe/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPremiere Pro's auto-captioning is also getting upgraded to include translations. Adobe said it has heard from users that they want the ability to add captions in multiple languages on the same clip, and the new tool lets you do that without leaving Premiere. You can already automatically generate transcripts of your videos, and from there, you can add captions. With the new beta feature, you can transcribe those captions into 17 different languages, including Spanish, German, French and Japanese.\n\nA couple of other smaller updates were also announced this week. Frame.io is now compatible with two new cameras (the Canon C80 and C400), and the After Effects beta app is also getting improved caching and HDR support. Adobe made the announcement in advance of the Sundance Film Festival, where 60% of this year's films used Premiere Pro during their editing processes, according to a survey from the Sundance Institute.\n\nFor more on Adobe, check out Photoshop's collaboration feature and anti-reflection tool.",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other best falling stocks to invest in right now.\n\nThe overall stock market has been in an uptrend, as depicted by major indices trading near all-time highs. The rally has come at the back of several key factors, including artificial intelligence frenzy and optimism about accommodative monetary policies, with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.\n\nAfter two years of consecutive gains, valuations have gotten out of hand, with some stocks trading at levels and multiples not seen in years. The eye-watering valuations are raising concerns among value investors, constantly on the hunt for bargains. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management analysts have also fired warning shots about valuations that have gotten out of hand.\n\nAccording to analysts\u2019 expectations of earnings growth are too ambitious at a time when it is still unclear what President Donald Trump will do. \u201cPolicy uncertainty from the new administration appears underpriced. 2025 is not at all like 2017, and we view the risks as much higher,\u201d said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the wealth management unit\u2019s global investment office. According to Shalett, investors are better off diversifying their portfolio by pairing investments in domestic stocks and bonds with equities outside the US.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Howard Marks\u2019 Top 10 Stock Picks and 10 Cheap Value Stocks to Invest In, According To Seth Klarman.\n\nWhile the rally in the equity markets has come on growing expectations that the US Fed will cut interest rates aggressively, it could stall as President Trump swings into action. According to UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti, the expected decline in interest rates could be stalled should Trump impose tariffs on allies.\n\n\u201cSomething that I\u2019ve been saying for a while, inflation is much stickier than we have been saying. The [truth] of the matter is that we need to see also how tariffs will play a role in inflation. Tariffs will probably not really help inflation to come down. And therefore I don\u2019t see rates coming down as fast as people believe,\u201d Ermotti said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nMost stocks trading at all-time highs are enjoying premium valuations on investors betting on them amid expectations of lower interest rates. Amid the blockbuster gains, some stocks have gone the opposite way, tanking to levels not seen in years. The selloff that has come into play has given rise to undervalued stocks trading close to their 52-week lows. While the prospects of the selloff persist, stocks are also showing signs of bottoming out. Consequently, the best-falling stocks to invest in are companies backed by solid underlying fundamentals affirming their long-term prospects.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Anyone who works in supply chain is no stranger to acronyms. 3PL (Third-Party Logistics). CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight). COGS (Costs of Goods Sold). LTL (Less Than Truckload). The list goes on and on.\n\nWhen you think about optimizing the supply chain, most companies think about inventory management, logistics and operating costs. Of course, these matter. But there\u2019s another acronym that doesn\u2019t get as much attention as it should \u2013 DBT (Days Beyond Terms).\n\nWhat is DBT?\n\nDBT refers to the number of days past payment terms that a company pays its suppliers. It provides a clear picture of how reliable a company is and how long it will take to pay invoices.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a supplier hoping to produce goods for a manufacturing company, or vice versa, you need to look at the DBT of the company you want to work with. Why? Because you need to see through hard data how well (or poorly) they pay their bills. Essentially, the lower a company\u2019s DBT is, the more reliable they are as a payer.\n\nLet\u2019s say a retailer has hired a supplier to manufacture their apparel. For that supplier, being paid on time could make or break their ability to continue doing business and to complete production orders for that customer (and other customers). The longer it takes for a customer to pay, the more strain is put on the supplier\u2019s cash flow. Late payments have a domino effect.\n\nHow DBT Can Be a Strong Indicator of Cash Flow Issues\n\nTo get the full picture, you need to look at how the company\u2019s DBT fluctuates over a 12-month period. As you look at DBT trends for a company, there are several red flags you\u2019ll want to look out for. For example, if a company had a relatively stable DBT (hovering between 6 and 8) for a few months but then its DBT spiked to 50 in a single month and then continued to rise for the next six months, this would indicate something has changed with their finances and they\u2019re taking longer to pay their suppliers.\n\nWhen Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy on May 21, 2024, it was facing multiple financial challenges. The restaurant chain reported that it lost an estimated $12.5 million in operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. Plus, the company\u2019s \u201cEndless Shrimp\u201d promotion backfired and resulted in major losses.\n\nThis is a prime example of how DBT can be a strong indicator of cash flow issues. When we looked at the company\u2019s DBT over the 12-month period leading up to the bankruptcy filing, we could see that the company\u2019s DBT was 15 in December 2023 \u2013 meaning it typically paid suppliers 15 days late (beyond payment terms). But after that, its DBT spiked drastically \u2013 jumping to 26 in January 2024 and then nearly doubling to 47 in February 2024. As of March 2024, its DBT was 48. So, that means Red Lobster\u2019s suppliers would often be waiting upwards of two months past their payment due date to get paid. If they had Net 60 or Net 90 payment terms, it could have been well over four months before they saw their first invoice paid by Red Lobster. It was also worrying that the company\u2019s DBT had been so volatile and spiked drastically multiple times. This shows the company may not have done the necessary cash flow forecasting to protect itself from potential losses, revenue declines and challenging market conditions. It probably didn\u2019t help that Thai Union Group decided to exit from its investment in Red Lobster.\n\nWhy DBT is Often Overlooked in the Supply Chain\n\nLet\u2019s talk about why it\u2019s such an underrated financial metric and can be overlooked by other supply chain metrics.\n\nOne key reason is that many companies don\u2019t know that business credit reports exist. But more than that, many don\u2019t understand how different business credit reports are from consumer credit reports. With consumer credit reports, credit score and credit limit are usually the two data points that everyone cares about. While these are both available in business credit reports, they aren\u2019t the only data points that matter.\n\nWhen assessing the financial health of a customer or supplier, you should analyze the DBT data in parallel with other relevant information, including:",

In the control arm, these respective rates were 1.8%, 38.2%, 30.9%, 3.6%, 8.2%, and 17.3%.\n\n\u201c[Data from the BREAKWATER] study support encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 as a new standard of care in the first line for patients with BRAF V600E\u2013mutated mCRC and formed the basis of the accelerated approval by the FDA,\u201d lead study author Scott Kopetz, MD, PhD, FACP, said in a presentation of the data. Kopetz is deputy chair for Translational Research and a professor in the Department of Gastrointestinal (GI) Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine; leader of the Department of Cancer Center Support Grant, GI Program; TRACTION medical director in the Division of Therapeutics Discovery Division; and associate vice president for Translational Integration at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nIn December 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to encorafenib in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 for the treatment of patients with mCRC harboring a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.2\n\nBREAKWATER Breakdown\n\nInvestigators for the open-label, multicenter study enrolled patients at least 16 years of age (or at least 18 years of age based on the country) with BRAF V600E\u2013mutated mCRC per local or central laboratory testing.1 Prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting was not allowed. Key inclusion criteria consisted of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function.\n\nPatients were excluded if they received prior treatment with a BRAF or EGFR inhibitor; had symptomatic brain metastases; or harbored a RAS mutation. Patients with mismatch repair\u2013deficient/microsatellite instability\u2013high disease were excluded; however, these patients were allowed to enroll if they were ineligible to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors due to a pre-existing medical condition.\n\nThe study enrolled 637 patients who were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive encorafenib plus cetuximab alone (n = 158); encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n = 236); or standard-of-care mFOLFOX6 alone (n = 243). Data for the encorafenib/cetuximab arm will be reported at a later date.\n\nPatients were stratified by region (United States/Canada vs Europe vs rest of world) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1).\n\nProgression-free survival and ORR per BICR assessment for encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 vs mFOLFOX6 alone served as the trial\u2019s dual primary end points. Notably, for this analysis, ORR was assessed in the first 110 patients enrolled in the respective arms. Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary end point. OS was only tested if the ORR difference was statistically significant.\n\nAmong all enrolled patients between the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm and the mFOLFOX6 arm (n = 479), the median age was 61.0 years (range, 24-84). Most patients were male (50.5%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (54.3%), right-sided tumors (61.0%), 2 or fewer organs involved (52.4%), liver metastases (62.6%), a carcinoembryonic antigen level of more than 5 \u00b5g/L (68.7%), and a C-reactive protein level of no more than 10 mg/L (50.9%).\n\nThe median treatment duration was 28.1 weeks (range, 1.3-107.4) in the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm vs 20.4 weeks (range, 1.1-98.3) in the mFOLFOX6 arm. All patients in both arms were randomly assigned; however, 2.1% and 5.8% of patients were not treated, respectively.\n\nAs of the data cutoff date of December 22, 2023, 58.1% of patients in the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm were still receiving treatment. Reasons for discontinuation included adverse effects (AEs; 4.7%), death (3.4%), PD (20.8%), patient withdrawal (5.5%), global deterioration of health status (3.4%), and other (4.2%). In the mFOLFOX6 arm, 33.7% of patients were still receiving treatment at data cutoff; reasons for discontinuation comprised AEs (9.1%), death (4.1%), PD (31.7%), patient withdrawal (11.5%), deterioration of global health status (1.6%), and other (8.2%).\n\nAdditional Efficacy and Safety Data\n\nThe median time to response was 7.1 weeks (range, 5.7-53.7) in the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm vs 7.3 weeks (range, 5.4-48.0) in the chemotherapy arm. The estimated duration of response (DOR) was 13.9 months (range, 8.5-not evaluable [NE]) and 11.1 months (range, 6.7-12.7), respectively. In the experimental arm, the 6- and 12-month DOR rates were 68.7% and 22.4%, respectively. In the control arm, these respective rates were 34.1% and 11.4%.\n\nKopetz noted that the ORR benefit was consistent across subgroups with the experimental regimen.\n\nThe median follow-up for OS was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.6-11.6) in the experimental arm vs 9.8 months (95% CI, 7.5-11.3) in the control arm. The median OS was NE (95% CI, 19.8-NE) vs 14.6 months (95% CI, 13.4-NE) for the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm and the mFOLFOX6 arm, respectively (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.318-0.691; P = .0000454). At the time of this analysis, the OS difference was not statistically significant.\n\nRegarding safety, any-grade treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 99.6% of patients in the experimental arm (n = 231) vs 97.8% of patients in the control arm (n = 228). The rates of grade 3/4 TEAEs were 74.0% and 61.0%, respectively. The respective rates of grade 5 TEAEs were 4.3% and 4.4%. Serious TEAEs were reported in 37.7% of patients in the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm vs 34.6% of patients in the mFOLFOX6 arm.\n\nIn the encorafenib plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 group, TEAEs led to permanent discontinuation of any treatment, dose reduction of any treatment, and dose interruption of any treatment in 20.8%, 61.0%, and 84.8% of patients, respectively. These respective rates were 14.9%, 47.8%, and 64.0% in the control arm.\n\nSpecifically in the experimental arm, TEAEs led to the discontinuation of encorafenib, cetuximab, and mFOLFOX6 in 11.7%, 13.0%, and 15.6% of patients, respectively. The respective rates of dose reduction for each treatment due to TEAEs were 22.1%, 6.1%, and 55.8%. The rates of dose interruptions due to TEAEs were 56.7% for encorafenib, 58.4% for cetuximab, and 75.8% for mFOLFOX6.\n\nTreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) of any grade were observed in 98.7% of patients in the experimental arm and 93.0% of patients in the mFOLFOX6 arm.

            "content": "Sundance 2025: How Editor Lev Lewis Crafted Cinematic Fever Dream \u201cDead Lover\u201d on Premiere Pro\n\nImage Source: Sundance Institute, Photo by Sheridan Smith\n\nPremiering on January 24th at Sundance, \u201cDead Lover\u201d is a Midnight comedy and cinematic fever dream from director, co-writer and actor Grace Glowicki.\n\nThe film follows a lonely gravedigger (played by Glowicki) who finally meets her dream man, but their whirlwind affair is cut short when he tragically drowns at sea. Grief-stricken, she goes to morbid lengths to resurrect him through madcap scientific experiments, resulting in grave consequences and unlikely love.\n\nEditor Lev Lewis worked closely with Glowicki to create the film\u2019s colorful spectrum of creative influences \u2013 from disco to German Expressionism to sketch comedy to Bugs Bunny. Because the film was shot in only 16 days and almost entirely on a black soundstage with minimal backgrounds to differentiate scenes, Lewis relied on the fluidity of Premiere Pro to organize takes, streamline his workflow and bring this genre-bending, \u201ccinematic fever dream\u201d to the big screen.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nI\u2019ve known one of the producers, Yona Strauss, for a number of years and she contacted me to manage their dailies and put together an assembly\u2014a small job, as Grace, the director, initially wanted to edit the film herself. Being a fan of Grace and Ben and the whole team, I accepted and quickly found myself quite taken with the footage. After the assembly was completed, I handed the project over and went off to do another film, but after a couple of months, Grace and Yona recontacted me to see if I would be interested in taking over the edit and I happily accepted.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nFinishing a Shabbat dinner with family/friends. It was wonderful news to receive, although I wasn\u2019t completely surprised because I knew the film was good and that Grace has a history with the festival. I think I was mostly glad that this project, which my intuition had been telling me was very good for almost two years, was also being received that way by others and was finding success.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nVaries slightly from project to project, but generally I create broad folders/bins for Media, Scenes, SFX, Music, VFX, Graphics etc. In the past I would select my clips mostly from a Scenes bin, where I would have each take laid out in Thumbnail view and each clip marked up heavily with action, reset, cut and then additional markers for any moments that stand out to me. However, on \u201cDead Lover,\u201d the markers weren\u2019t especially important as they shot 16mm and therefore would immediately roll action and cut\u2014unlike most digital productions which tend to start recording ages before they actually call action and will often do rolling takes. In the last year and a half, I\u2019ve migrated over to selecting my clips from different timeline sequences demarcated by scene. In addition, I will get an assistant to create relatively thorough string-outs for the majority of beats.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nI\u2019m partial to Ben Petrie\u2019s portrayal of a German man named Swimmer. If you\u2019ve seen the film, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m referring to. There\u2019s also a moment early on where the two lead characters\u2019 hands grasp one another and Grace filmed it in a lovely tight shot. It\u2019s just very good and effective, and I always enjoy that. But there are lots of moments. I\u2019m extremely fond of this film.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nDuring production, the biggest technical challenge was scene organization. Because this was a micro-budget film with 16 days to shoot, takes weren\u2019t always slated perfectly. This is not atypical and is usually not that hard to sort, but adding extra confusion in this instance is that the film is shot almost entirely on a black soundstage with minimal backgrounds to differentiate scenes\u2014plus production would consistently deviate from the shooting script. Making sense of an errant unmarked take or inconsistently marked take was quite the task and, occasionally I would use a clip that was meant for scene x in scene y. And, hey, every now and then I think that \u201cincorrect\u201d placement worked.\n\nWe kept things pretty simple and just used Premiere Pro. Within the program, we were able to manipulate our limited footage pretty aggressively. We also used some, admittedly, lo-fi effects like pulsating electricity from the video effects panel, which was helpful in just temping out what would be done more artfully down the line.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nSet up your own quick keys. Do some digging through the keyboard shortcuts and just Google something quickly if it\u2019s not immediately obvious what it does, because there are many tools that are a little buried that I\u2019ve found quite helpful. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to set up your tracks for precise patching. Other editing platforms force you into knowing which channel you\u2019re adding a clip to at all times, but Premiere Pro can also function like this, it just takes a minute to set it up and get used to it. Especially helpful if, like me, you use many audio tracks and don\u2019t just take the production audio mixdown.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nIn a micro sense, this varies from moment to moment. Broadly, it\u2019s the memory of all the times in my life that art has moved me\u2014a feeling I can remember experiencing as long as I have memories and which I\u2019m always chasing.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nAs an editor with strong opinions, control is an eternal problem for me. I get very invested in my work and, while I ultimately believe this investment is an asset, it\u2019s also something that I have to consistently step back from\u2014and acknowledge that I am not the final decision-maker and that the glory or the shame won\u2019t fall on my head. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve fully overcome this, nor do I want to. I would say balance is the goal I\u2019m trying to move towards.\n\n\n\nAs for advice for filmmakers, I would say vacuum up as much art as you can, live as fully as you can and try to make something that keeps you up at night. And, when you\u2019re editing, don\u2019t skimp on the sound work.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nImage Source: Lev Lewis\n\nThis is my home office, but I also sometimes work out of a post facility or another production-related office. As for my favourite thing in my workspace, it\u2019s this long desk that my wife got custom-made for this strangely-sized room. I also like my La Marquise d\u2019O poster and my framed Sideways ticket stub.",

As per SAP, the changes occurring in 2025 revolve around autonomous AI agents, specialized AI models, user interface design, and enterprise adoption patterns. On 13th January, an AI behemoth highlighted that the first Trump Administration focused on America\u2019s strength and success in AI, boosting an environment where the broader US industry can compete.\n\nTherefore, mainstream AI is now a critical part of every new application, which helps fuel economic growth, promote US interests, and make sure that America can sustain its leadership in cutting-edge technology. On a related note, Trump announced billions of dollars in private sector investment focused on building AI infrastructure in the country.\n\nTrump Announces $500 Billion Investment for AI Infrastructure\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion focused on financing infrastructure for AI, targeting to outperform rival nations in the business-critical technology. Mr. President went on to add that ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are discussing a JV called Stargate, which is expected to build data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the US. Notably, these companies, together with several other equity backers of Stargate, decided to commit $100 billion for immediate deployment. The remaining investment is expected to take place over the upcoming 4 years.\n\nAs per Trump, this is the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Also, Stargate is expected to build the physical and virtual infrastructure which will focus on powering the next generation of AI, including data centers around the US.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nAI Rally to Continue in 2025, Says UBS\n\nAs per UBS, the AI rally has aided in driving 2 straight years of healthy returns for the NASDAQ Composite, which also includes a 28% rally last year. The Mag 7 group of technology stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2024. In the previous year, continued upward revisions in AI capex from the Big 4 tech giants supported keeping the AI rally on track.

These enhancements focus on improving efficiency, and as probably expected \u2013 they include AI-powered features and workflow optimizations.\n\nPremiere Pro: Search smarter and translate captions\n\nPremiere Pro introduces the Media Intelligence & Search Panel, an AI-powered tool designed to help you find specific clips quickly. Currently available in beta, it automatically analyzes footage for elements like objects, locations, camera angles, and metadata. You can search with natural language, such as \u201csunset shot with a city skyline,\u201d and the tool will display relevant clips.\n\nThe update also includes Caption Translation, which automates multilingual caption creation in 17 languages. This feature aims to simplify captioning, making it more accessible to creators working with international audiences.\n\nAfter Effects: Faster previews and HDR improvements\n\nIn After Effects, a new caching system enables smoother playback of complex compositions by utilizing both RAM and high-speed storage. This lets you preview your projects with fewer interruptions, even on older hardware.\n\nThis beta feature also adds HDR support, enabling accurate monitoring and exporting of high-dynamic-range content. Motion designers can work with HDR projects using professional I/O hardware or directly on laptops, ensuring compatibility with modern display standards.\n\nFrame.io: New Camera to Cloud integration\n\nThe update extends Camera to Cloud (C2C) functionality in Frame.io to select Canon cameras, including the EOS C80 and C400 models. This integration allows you to upload proxy files directly to the cloud during production, making them accessible to postproduction teams within minutes. The feature aims to streamline workflows and reduce the risk of losing footage on set.\n\nAlignment with Sundance and support for filmmakers\n\nAs the updates come ahead of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, Adobe highlighted these updates during the festival, where 85% of entries used Adobe tools like Premiere Pro and After Effects. Additionally, Adobe announced a $5 million increase in funding for its Film & TV Fund, which supports underrepresented filmmakers.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe new features are available for Creative Cloud subscribers. Keep in mind, though, that intelligent search, caption translation, faster previews and HDR improvements are only available in beta for now. For more details, visit the Premiere Pro and After Effects beta pages on Adobe\u2019s website. You can find more details about the updates on Adobe blog.",

The median overall survival (OS) was 12.42 months in the investigational arm vs 9.72 months in the control arm (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.56-1.60; log-rank P = .82). The objective tumor response rates (OTRRs) were 38.3% and 26.9% for the investigational and control arms, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe addition of certepetide is safe and despite showing no improvement in 6-month PFS, a possible signal of benefit in OS and ORR (including 4 complete responses) was observed, warranting further investigation,\u201d lead study author Andrew Dean, MBChB, MRCP (UK), FRACP, head of the Department of Medical Oncology at St John of God Subiaco Hospital, and a consultant at GenesisCare at Shenton House in Perth, Australia, and coauthors, wrote in the poster. \u201cA further cohort (cohort B) of the ASCEND study evaluating the addition of a second dose of certepetide is ongoing.\u201d\n\nGemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is a standard frontline therapy for patients with advanced and metastatic PDAC. Certepetide is a novel cyclic peptide that enhances the penetration of concurrently administered drugs into the tumor and stroma, resulting in potentially increased antineoplastic activity.\n\nThe randomized, double-blind, multicenter ASCEND was designed to evaluate the impact of adding certepetide to this chemotherapy backbone in this population.\n\nEligible patients had histologically confirmed advanced PDAC suitable for therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Patients were also required to have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 3.2 mg/kg of certepetide (n = 65) or placebo (n = 30) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, both in combination with 1,000 mg/m2 of intravenous (IV) gemcitabine and 125 mg/m2 of IV nab-paclitaxel.\n\nPatients underwent a minimum 18-month follow-up period, during which data were evaluated for PFS, OTRR, OS, safety, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), exploratory research biomarkers, and E-PRO feasibility.\n\nA total of 198 patients were screened; 66 patients were allocated to the investigational arm and 29 were allocated to the placebo arm between May 2022 and December 2023. One patient from each arm did not receive the allocated intervention and were omitted from the full analysis set.\n\nThe primary analysis was conducted with 70 total deaths.\n\nBaseline characteristics in the overall population (n = 95) indicated that the mean age was 65 years (range, 37-86) and most patients were male (60%) and had an ECOG performance status of 1 (54%). The pancreatic tumor location was found in the body (19%), head (44%), and tail (31%), and was unknown in 6.3% of cases. Adenocarcinoma represented the most common histologic subtype (89%) followed by poorly differentiated carcinoma (11%). Most patients had stage IV disease (96%) as opposed to stage III disease (4%) according to the 8th edition of the AJCC. Sites of metastatic disease included the liver (73%), pulmonary tract (28%), peritoneum (21%), and other (28%). Prior treatment included systemic therapy (15%) and surgery (19%).\n\nAdditional findings indicated that among patients with an ECOG performance status of 0, the 6-month PFS rate was 68.1% (95% CI, 48.7%-81.4%) in the investigational arm vs 36.4% (95% CI, 11.2%-62.7%) in the control arm.\n\nIn terms of safety, grade 3/4 adverse effects (AEs) that occurred in at least 10% of patients included decreased neutrophil count (investigational: 18% vs control: 8%), anemia (14%; 4%), decreased platelet count (12%; 4%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%; 4%), febrile neutropenia (8%; 3%), lung infection (8%; 3%), fatigue (6%; 3%), sepsis (6%; 3%), thromboembolic event (6%; 2%), and increased alanine aminotransferase levels (5%; 2%).\n\nReference\n\nDean A, Sjoquist K, Gebski V, et al.

This year, Adobe, which is presenting sponsor and the official editing platform of the festival, took over 608 Main Street to create Adobe House, which from Jan. 24-27 is offering three levels of activations, content and special events.\n\n\u201cWe are going even bigger this year than last, and one of the things we\u2019re really trying to do is make sure we\u2019re engaging the full breadth of members of the film industry that touch our products every year,\u201d Heather Freeland, chief brand officer at Adobe, told EM. \u201cSo, we\u2019re increasing the programming that we\u2019re doing and partnerships we have across the week with others in the industry to engage unsung heroes in film, the folks who are behind the scenes\u2014the editors, the directors, but also the gaffers, the sound engineers\u2014because they\u2019re an important part of our community.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Adobe House begins at the ground level with a collab with The North Face where hand-selected directors will be able to pick up an Adobe co-branded jacket. On the second floor is a community art project incorporating Adobe Firefly, the brand\u2019s generative AI model for editing, where participants will be able to create on-site and share with the wider community. And on the third level, the brand has created a space designed to look like the art department of a film set, mirroring the different phases of filmmaking. Attendees will be able to customize their own beanie and attend panel discussions, networking events and dinners.\n\nAmong these events is a meet-and-greet for the Sundance Ignite X Adobe Fellowship program, in addition to programming around introducing next-gen filmmakers, AI in filmmaking and diverse storytelling. A special focus of Adobe\u2019s is around helping filmmakers market their work, with Freeland herself leading a panel on marketing effectively with the tools available.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly excited about how we\u2019ve built this like you\u2019re on a film set,\u201d Freeland says. \u201cWe have different stations throughout that celebrate the journey and the behind-the-scenes, and so you can get coffee and snacks at the craft services area, we have the \u2018screening room\u2019 for panels, we\u2019re going to have gaffers\u2019 tape on the floor to mark things out, so that it really feels like home to this community.\u201d Agencies: Amplify, Groundwork Events\n\nInside Adobe House at Sundance Film Festival:\n\nFrom the Sundance Archives:",

When she falls in love with a chair she can\u2019t afford and then becomes that very chair, the film begs the question: in a society that refuses to acknowledge your existence, is it better to be a chair? Juliette Lewis stars in this epic fable that cleverly pokes fun at the social scripts people use to convince themselves their lives have purpose.\n\nShearn relied on Premiere Pro, Productions and Frame.io to bring Kramer\u2019s surreal, spontaneous vision to life in an extremely tight timeframe, finishing a full cut just a month after filming wrapped to make the Sundance deadline. Specifically, the \u201cReview with Frame.io\u201d panel was key to helping Shearn quickly review, digest and implement feedback from Kramer and the producers. To ensure a positive editing experience, Shearn\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cPrep is everything. Once I\u2019m really digging in, I want to indulge in as little \u2018left brain\u2019 thinking as possible.\u201d\n\nRead on for a behind-the-scenes look at editing \u201cBy Design,\u201d premiering at Sundance on January 23rd.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nI\u2019ve been involved with Amanda Kramer\u2019s work from the beginning. We really came up together, and unless I do something egregious, I imagine we\u2019ll continue as long as she\u2019s making films.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nI have the most L.A. answer imaginable: I was driving. Amanda called me, said we had just been invited to premiere at Sundance, then hung up. I was elated at first, then\u2026terrified. We hadn\u2019t picture locked yet!! (We did a week later.)\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nPrep is everything. Once I\u2019m really digging in, I want to indulge in as little \u201cleft brain\u201d thinking as possible. I use a simple workspace via Productions where all assets are scrupulously logged and transcribed. Our script supervisor, Abbey Spacil, is a cinema polymath and her logs were essential. So, I took pains to ensure ALL her annotations and analysis were reflected in the metadata.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nI can\u2019t fully explain why, but I\u2019m just endlessly pleased with how \u201cwine with Lisa (Samatha Mathis) and Irene (Robin Tunney)\u201d came out. The inherent absurdity of people carrying on a (serious) conversation with an inanimate human/object is never clearer, or funnier, than that moment.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nThe biggest challenge on \u201cBy Design\u201d was speed. From pre-to pro-to post-, we just moved so, so quickly. For instance, we wrapped on August 23rd and had a full cut for Sundance a month later. You can\u2019t second guess or endlessly tweak on that schedule, which can be nerve-wracking but also, of course, liberating. Amanda craves spontaneity at all stages, even editing.\n\nSo much post-production functionality can happen right in Premiere Pro, so the bulk of my work stayed there. The \u2018Review with Frame IO\u2019 panel is a godsend! Especially when you need to quickly digest feedback. On this show, I used it to render cuts directly to my account where Amanda and the producers added notes and then I downloaded them as comment markers. Then, next round: rinse, repeat. Brilliant.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nProductions! If you aren\u2019t using Productions and/or Team Projects by now you are living in the past.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nI just read Paul Hirsch\u2019s (editor of Star Wars and Ferris Bueller's Day Off) memoir, and there\u2019s a brilliant if not hilariously reductive editing quote in there: \u201cDon\u2019t be confusing. Don\u2019t be boring. Everything else is fair game.\u201d Words to live by.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nI think 95% of freelance editors will agree on the ultimate challenge: cash flow. Keeping that steady stream of work alive, remaining creatively fulfilled, staying human. My advice on how to manage it all? Xanax. Coffee. Community. Oh, and take walks!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nMy set-up is spartan. A Mac Studio, keyboard, mouse, two striped OWC Thunderblade drives, two LG monitors and video out to a wall mounted TV on which, when I\u2019m not working, I watch (mostly) unspeakable trash. The only thing of real note is my bootleg Matrix mousepad (I hear Thelma Schoonmaker has one, too).",

It\u2019s hard not to compare that to more affordable, stable alternatives like DaVinci Resolve, which continue to offer solid functionality without the same headaches.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in and take a closer look at what these updates bring to the table.\n\nPremiere Pro Search Panel | Source: Adobe\n\nPremiere Pro\u2019s AI-powered Media Intelligence and the new Search panel\n\nThe updates in Premiere Pro (beta) focus heavily on improving efficiency for editors. A standout feature is the Media Intelligence system, which uses AI to automatically tag and identify visuals in your footage. This includes objects, locations, camera angles, and other metadata, allowing editors to quickly find specific clips using natural language.\n\nFor example, typing \u201cwide shot of a desert landscape\u201d into the new Search panel will instantly surface relevant results. This feature eliminates the need for hours of manual scrubbing through footage, which is a game-changer for large-scale projects\u200b\u200b.\n\nSource: Adobe\n\nMultilingual caption translation\n\nAnother important addition in Premiere is caption translation, which automates the creation of multilingual captions in 17 languages. With captions becoming essential for accessibility and audience engagement, this feature ensures that editors can expand their content\u2019s reach to a global audience without adding excessive time or expense to their workflows. Adobe also allows for multiple caption tracks, enabling editors to prepare content for diverse audiences more efficiently\u200b.\n\nCheck out our earlier coverage of Adobe\u2019s updates to Premiere 2025 here.\n\nAfter Effects interface Source: Adobe\n\nAfter Effects gets faster playbacks and HDR support\n\nMotion designers will appreciate the focus on performance in the latest After Effects (beta). The improved caching system is a major advancement, using both RAM and hard drives to allow for faster previews and playback of larger, more complex compositions. Even older systems can now handle extensive projects with fewer interruptions, keeping creative momentum intact\u200b.\n\nThe updated HDR support is another step forward. Motion designers working in high-dynamic-range (HDR) can now accurately monitor and export their work, ensuring that vivid, eye-catching visuals maintain their quality throughout the entire production process. Whether you\u2019re working on a laptop or a professional-grade monitor, the workflow improvements make HDR content creation more accessible than ever\u200b.\n\nFrame.io Native Camera to Cloud for Canon C400 and C80\n\nYou might recall from our coverage here about Camera-to-Cloud (C2C) coming to the Canon C400 and C80. Now it\u2019s officially available!\n\nThis is one of the most exciting updates to Frame.io for a Canon fan like me. This feature allows proxy files to be automatically uploaded to Frame.io during production. With no need for manual file transfers, editors and story producers can begin working on footage almost immediately, even as production is ongoing.\n\nThis integration helps teams collaborate in real-time, minimizing delays and reducing the risk of costly reshoots by identifying and addressing issues early. Turnaround times are shrinking across the board, and the fast-paced world of filmmaking is only getting faster. The C2C workflow enables post teams to review footage sooner, giving them the chance to refine edits and perfect their work before deadlines hit.\n\nAll you need is a Frame.io account, a Canon C80 or C400, a network connection, and a quick six-digit pairing code to start uploading footage to the Cloud within minutes. As someone who works on large teams in documentary filmmaking, I can see how this could be a big help. When you\u2019re dealing with tons of footage and tight deadlines, having everything ready to review and edit so quickly makes it way easier to stay organized and keep the whole team on track.\n\nAll these features for Premiere Pro and After Effects are available now in beta. For more information on how to access the beta apps, please visit the Premiere Pro (beta) page.\n\nEnd note from an editor on Adobe updates\n\nAdobe\u2019s updates demonstrate their ongoing commitment to providing smarter, faster tools for creators. Features like AI-powered Media Intelligence and Camera-to-Cloud integration show that Adobe is thinking about the challenges of modern production workflows.\n\nHowever, as an editor, I can\u2019t ignore the issues I\u2019ve faced with the software recently. Stability problems in Premiere Pro and After Effects, especially with multicam workflows and stabilization-heavy projects, are persistent frustrations. It\u2019s worth noting that stability concerns are also the most common feedback I hear from other creators when writing about Adobe\u2019s new features.\n\nCost is another factor. Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud All Apps plan is $59.99/month, while Premiere Pro or After Effects individually cost $22.99/month each. Meanwhile, competitors like Blackmagic\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut X, and even CapCut offer similar functionality at significantly lower costs, some even being free. Resolve, for instance, has a one-time purchase option, making it far more budget-friendly.\n\nI purchased my Resolve Studio license second-hand in 2011 for just $100, and it\u2019s been worth every penny. It\u2019s a reminder that while Adobe offers cutting-edge features and seamless integration, alternatives exist that can deliver comparable results without the high price tag.\n\nNew features and AI tools are great, but the true value in editing lies in the editor\u2019s experience, not the tools alone. While speeding up workflows can be helpful, it often feels more like a way to minimize effort and cut costs for producers rather than elevating the creative process.\n\nWhat do you think of the latest Adobe updates?

            "content": "As the new year begins, the air cargo industry reflects on heightened risks of the busy holiday season while facing the challenges ahead. The surge in movement during the holidays exposed goods to the vulnerabilities of theft and tampering, and reports from insurance companies and analysts like Verisk indicated that cargo theft is on the rise. To navigate these risks, the industry relies on a robust framework of protocols that include detailed cargo classifications, strict federal regulations, and thorough compliance training. From securing containers to maintaining ground safety for personnel and equipment, air cargo security demands a comprehensive approach. Security seals play a critical role in safeguarding goods and ensuring operational integrity in 2025.\n\nThreats to Air Cargo Security\n\nCargo operators face severe reputational and financial risks if implicated in activities such as trafficking or smuggling. While modern screening systems are adept at detecting weapons and explosives, they are less effective at identifying wildlife, for instance. Targeted training for screeners to recognize wildlife in cargo could significantly mitigate this particular risk. Additional threats include:\n\nCounterfeit Goods: Air cargo is frequently targeted for the transportation of counterfeit products, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and luxury items. These can pose significant economic and safety risks.\n\nCybersecurity Breaches: With increasing digitalization, air cargo systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, steal sensitive information, or compromise cargo tracking systems.\n\nHuman Trafficking: Unscrupulous actors may exploit air cargo networks to transport individuals illegally, posing serious humanitarian and legal concerns.\n\nHazardous Materials: Undeclared or improperly labeled hazardous materials can lead to catastrophic incidents during transit, endangering lives and property.\n\nInsider Threats: Employees with malicious intent or those susceptible to coercion may exploit their positions to compromise cargo security, facilitating theft, smuggling or sabotage.\n\nAdapting to Changing Environments for Safety\n\nIn September 2024, the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Transport Canada implemented emergency measures for air cargo originating from Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and destined for or transiting through the United States. These measures followed alarming reports of two incendiary packages igniting within European parcel networks, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced global supply chain security protocols.\n\nCompliance with federal security measures is critical, as non-adherence can lead to significant delays and financial penalties. For instance, the Consignment Security Declaration (CSD) is now more crucial than ever. The CSD provides an audit trail documenting how, when, and by whom specific cargo shipments were secured, ensuring transparency and compliance with security regulations.\n\nTo stay ahead of regulatory changes, supply chain executives and procurement teams must:\n\nCheck Federal Updates: Regularly monitor TSA and Transport Canada websites for policy changes.\n\nJoin Industry Newsletters: Subscribe to security-focused newsletters from associations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA ) and Cargo Network Services (CNS).\n\nLeverage Industry Resources: Utilize online tools and databases like the World Cargo Security Forum to stay informed about global supply chain risks and compliance standards.\n\nThe evolving air cargo security landscape demands vigilance and proactive measures to maintain compliance, safeguard operations, and ensure uninterrupted global trade flows.\n\nSecurity Seals and a Layered Approach to Air Cargo Security\n\nTamper-evident security seals and tamper-evident labels play a pivotal role in air cargo security, providing clear indications of tampering and ensuring traceability in the audit trail, tracking when goods arrive at their destinations intact and identifying a weak link. A layered approach that combines high-quality security seals with a culture of enhanced security measures creates effective barriers to theft and damage.\n\nSecurity seals must meet rigorous standards of integrity, reliability and quality. Security seals help to ensure both the physical security of cargo and transparency within the supply chain. Unique identifiers on seals enable tracking and help pinpoint weak links in the logistics network.\n\nInnovative Security Seals: A Step Towards Airline Sustainability\n\nAs the aviation industry strives for sustainability, security seals are evolving to align with environmental goals. Traditional seals, typically made from single-use plastics, ensure cargo integrity but contribute to plastic waste. Airlines are now turning to innovative products made from recycled materials to reduce their ecological footprint. Standard eco-friendly security seals solutions for airlines can include adjustable, fixed length or padlock security seals.\n\nSecurity seals made from recycled materials offer multiple advantages:\n\nEnvironmental Impact: They reduce the use of virgin plastic and promote a circular economy by repurposing materials that might otherwise end up in landfills.\n\nMaintain Standards: These seals provide the same level of security and integrity as traditional ones, ensuring safety is not compromised.\n\nSustainability Goals: By adopting these eco-friendly options, airlines demonstrate their commitment to environmental stewardship, appealing to eco-conscious travelers and stakeholders.\n\nAdopting innovative security seals is a tangible step airlines can take toward reducing their plastic footprint and achieving the International Air Transport Association\u2019s (IATA) goal of decarbonizing aviation by 2050. These measures not only enhance security but also position airlines as leaders in sustainability.\n\nA More Sustainable Air Cargo Experience\n\nTransitioning to sustainable security practices is essential for the future of air cargo. By embracing security seals made from recycled plastics, airlines can maintain the highest security standards while actively contributing to environmental preservation. Such steps resonate with stakeholders, showcasing a commitment to both safety and sustainability.",

Crafting the perfect story takes time. Tedious tasks like holding for sound, chasing the golden hour, or watching a status bar crawl across the screen make it harder to see the big picture and have creative breakthroughs.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working hard to reduce tedium for video professionals, which means you\u2019ll spend less time hunting for the perfect clip, transcribing and translating footage, waiting for motion graphics to playback, or troubleshooting color pipelines. Leaving you more time to do the things you love.\n\nToday we\u2019re excited to introduce new features in Premiere Pro (beta), After Effects (beta), and Frame.io that will make editors and motion designers faster than ever.\n\nFor editors, finding the perfect shot is hard. Every editor has their own delicate, fastidious system for reviewing, logging, and finding their favorite moments as they piece together their timeline. But if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve also had this experience: you\u2019ve finished your edit, handed it off \u2014 then found the one magical shot you should have used after everyone starts watching it. It\u2019s the worst.\n\nWith new Media Intelligence and the Search panel in Premiere Pro (beta), the power of AI helps you find exactly what you need, when you need it. The content of your clips is automatically recognized, including objects, locations, camera angles, and more. With the new Search panel, you can use natural language to find visuals, spoken words, or content with embedded metadata like shoot date or camera type \u2014 all at the same time.\n\nThat means you can search footage for descriptive terms like \u201cperson skating with a lens flare\u201d or \u201cclose up of person running at sunset\u201d and see relevant moments I can quickly scrub through or load in the Source monitor. Or I can search for \u201cCalifornia\u201d and find related visuals, transcript mentions, and embedded metadata with shoot location all in one place!\n\nPlus, media analysis is super-fast and happens entirely on your own system, so you don\u2019t need an internet connection to use it. And as with all our AI-powered tools, your content is never used to train any AI models.\n\nGo global in seconds with Caption Translation in Premiere Pro (beta)\n\nSince we launched our popular Text-Based Editing workflow, we\u2019ve had fantastic feature requests like bulk removal of pauses and filler word detection. Now that we\u2019ve added those, we\u2019re working on the next most popular request: caption translation!\n\nCaptions have become increasingly critical for accessibility and engagement on social media. Now you can more easily expand your global audience with fast, accurate translations in 17 languages. Plus, you can have multiple caption tracks visible at the same time to display various languages or even assist you through editing in a different language.\n\nFast, seamless playback in After Effects (beta)\n\nEveryone wants to work faster and save time. After Effects (beta) is rising to meet that demand with new performance improvements that let you preview more of your comp than ever before.\n\nWe\u2019re introducing a faster, more modern caching system that uses both your computer\u2019s RAM and high-performance attached hard disks to preview and playback larger and more complex projects faster than ever before. It makes motion design more interactive, responsive, and fun.\n\nYou\u2019re no longer limited by the amount of RAM on your computer when you play back your work. That means even older desktops and laptops can now play back entire compositions in After Effects for the first time, without having to pause for caching. As soon as a comp is cached, press play, and spend more time watching creative work with less time spent waiting.\n\nGo end to end in HDR in After Effects (beta)\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019re bringing HDR monitoring to After Effects (beta). With support for PQ and HLG video, motion designers can now view their HDR comps accurately with improved video scopes that support HDR. Whether you\u2019re working on a laptop or using professional I/O hardware to send an HDR signal to a calibrated reference monitor, it\u2019s just as easy to work in HDR as it is to work in SDR with the latest version of After Effects (beta).\n\nFrame.io Camera to Cloud: Now available for select Canon cameras\n\nWe've partnered with Canon to deliver an exciting new integration between Frame.io Camera to Cloud (C2C) and Canon\u2019s C80 and C400 cameras. With a recent firmware update in December, you can now automatically upload proxy files directly from your Canon camera to Frame.io, giving your post-production teams and creative stakeholders access to footage from anywhere within moments of image capture. And since Premiere Pro supports raw camera formats from these cameras, this integration allows teams to get the best of both worlds: speed and quality. Send proxy files to the cloud quickly to start an edit and relink to the camera originals before your final delivery.\n\nThis seamless connection between production and post-production enables a whole new way to collaborate in real-time that unlocks faster project turnarounds and the ability to address potential issues before production wraps. By addressing problems as they occur, you can avoid costly reshoots and have greater confidence that everything you\u2019ve captured is securely stored and accessible regardless of location.\n\nWith just a Frame.io account, a Canon C80 or C400, a network connection, and a simple six-digit pairing code, you can get started uploading your video files to the cloud within minutes. Whether you\u2019re working on an independent project, or a large-scale production, this integration offers a streamlined, more efficient workflow from capture to edit.\n\nEverything you need, for everything you\u2019ll make.\n\nNo matter your workflow, genre, content, or delivery platform, we\u2019re focused on making tools that reduce the tedium so you can focus on what you love: telling your story. And as more professional editors and motion designers than ever choose Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io, we\u2019re continuing to prioritize core workflows so you can tell your story with powerful industry standard tools.\n\nMany of our Video Team members \u2014 product managers, engineers, marketers, and designers \u2014 are also editors, motion designers, and filmmakers who are passionate about delivering features that solve everyday pain points. We worked through iterating designs, testing ideas, and incorporating feedback based on real world use cases over months of development, and we\u2019re excited these features are available for you to use today.\n\nWe encourage you to try these new features in beta and give us your feedback! If you\u2019re a Creative Cloud member, you have access to beta apps. You can even install the betas side-by-side with the current releases of Premiere Pro and After Effects.\n\nAdobe at the Sundance Film Festival\n\nAccording to the annual Sundance Institute survey, Adobe's creative tools remain the go-to choice for filmmakers, with 85 percent of this year\u2019s entrants using Adobe applications, including Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Frame.io, and the Substance 3D Collection.

It\u2019s just one of several quality-of-life features Adobe is adding to Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io that aim to save video editors time on their projects.\n\nUsers can enter search terms like \u201ca person skating with a lens flare\u201d to find corresponding clips within their media library. Adobe says the media intelligence AI can automatically recognize \u201cobjects, locations, camera angles, and more,\u201d alongside spoken words \u2014 providing there\u2019s a transcript attached to the video. The feature doesn\u2019t detect audio or identify specific people, but it can scrub through any metadata attached to video files, which allows it to fetch clips based on shoot dates, locations, and camera types. The media analysis runs on-device, so doesn\u2019t require an internet connection, and Adobe reiterates that users\u2019 video content isn\u2019t used to train any AI models.\n\nThis is launching alongside a translation feature for video captions that supports 17 languages. Multiple caption tracks can be opened simultaneously in Premiere Pro to make it easier to view and edit several translations at once. The media intelligence-empowered Search panel and caption translations are available starting today in the beta version of Premiere Pro, which is available to anyone with an active Creative Cloud or Premiere Pro subscription.\n\nAfter Effects now supports HDR monitoring and has been overhauled with a new caching system that makes it faster to preview or playback large project files. The app is no longer limited to storing all the rendered frames in your system memory \u2014 instead, both RAM and the disk cache of your computer storage are used to improve performance. Adobe says this will allow older desktops and laptops to play back entire compositions \u201cwithout having to pause for caching or rendering.\u201d Both HDR support and the updated caching system are available in the After Effects Beta.\n\nFinally, Canon\u2019s C80 and C400 cameras can now be used with Frame.io\u2019s Camera to Cloud integration, which allows you to automatically upload files to the Frame.io app directly from the camera. Support for this was rolled out in a Canon firmware update in December, which users will need to install before using the feature.",

            "content": "With the famous Sundance Film Festival kicking off this week in Park City, Utah, Adobe thought it a good time to discuss what\u2019s next for Adobe Premiere Pro, a popular video editing platform for amateur and professional filmmakers alike.\n\nNo matter their experience level, all video editors deal with some of the same problems, including tedious tasks like finding clips, transcribing or translating footage, waiting for software to catch up, and dealing with complicated color spaces. Adobe hopes to address all these issues with new beta releases for Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io.\n\nIn the Premiere Pro beta, Adobe utilizes new artificial intelligence (AI) to help video editors find what they need faster than ever.\n\n\u201cWith new Media Intelligence and the Search panel in Premiere Pro (beta), the power of AI helps you find exactly what you need, when you need it,\u201d Adobe explains in a new blog post.\n\nPremiere Pro automatically analyzes the content of a user\u2019s clips and recognizes objects, locations, camera angles, and more. Within the new Search panel, users can seek out certain visuals, specific spoken words, or information within embedded metadata using natural language queries. For example, someone could search for a \u201cclose up of a person running at sunset,\u201d and Premiere Pro will find that clip. Or someone could look for \u201cCalifornia,\u201d and see all clips with related visuals, transcript mentions, and embedded location metadata. Adobe adds that this all occurs on the device, so users don\u2019t need an internet connection to use the media analysis and new search.\n\nPremiere Pro is also receiving caption translations. As of now, this works with 17 languages, although it is a safe bet that more will be added later. This also supports multi-language caption tracks so that multiple languages can be visible on-screen simultaneously.\n\nMoving to After Effects, Adobe is focusing on improving performance. After Effects (beta) has a new and improved caching system that uses both the computer\u2019s RAM and high-performance disks to preview and playback larger, complex projects faster than ever. The prior version relied exclusively on RAM, so adding disk resources should significantly speed up playback in After Effects.\n\nAfter Effects is also getting HDR monitoring with support for PQ and HLG video.\n\nJumping to the final cog in the Adobe video editing wheel, Frame.io, Camera to Cloud is now available for select Canon cameras. This was announced at Adobe MAX 2024, and now Canon EOS C80 and C400 cinema cameras natively work with Frame.io\u2019s Camera to Cloud feature. Adobe is quick to add that Premiere Pro supports RAW video files from these cameras, too.\n\n\u201cNo matter your workflow, genre, content, or delivery platform, we\u2019re focused on making tools that reduce the tedium so you can focus on what you love: telling your story,\u201d Adobe says. \u201cAnd as more professional editors and motion designers than ever choose Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io, we\u2019re continuing to prioritize core workflows so you can tell your story with powerful industry standard tools.\u201d\n\nAll the new features are now available in beta. Users can learn more about accessing Premiere Pro (beta) and After Effects (beta) on Adobe\u2019s website.\n\nImage credits: Adobe",

Nowhere does this come to life more than at the Sundance Film Festival which brings together creators and artists to celebrate groundbreaking films and puts the spotlight on emerging voices.\n\nThrough our decades long support for independent filmmaking, we\u2019re committed to bridging gaps and learning how to better support, elevate and amplify underrepresented creators and ensure the stories that are on screen authentically represent and reflect the world in which we live. This year, Adobe is a presenting sponsor at theSundance Film Festival. 2025 also marks the 10-year anniversary of the Sundance Ignite x Adobe Fellowship. On Main Street at the festival, the Adobe House will serve as a creativity and innovation hub \u2014 the go-to spot for community events, product demos, and conversations on diversity and collaboration. Once again, we are teaming up with Variety and IndieWire to spotlight filmmakers at the festival, including \u201cBubble & Squeak in Anatomy of a Film\u201d where attendees will hear from the film\u2019s creative team including Steven Yeun (Actor, Producer), Evan Twohy (Director), Christina Oh (Producer), Himesh Patel (Actor), and Sarah Goldberg (Actor). Variety will host the first ever Editors on Editors conversation series, exploring the art and craft of editing through a series of intimate fireside chats. \u201cExpanding Perspectives \u2014 The Power of Diverse Storytelling\u201d featuring Jesse Williams (Producer, \u201cHoops, Hopes, and Dreams\u201d), Dewayne Perkins (Writer, Actor, Producer), Tracy Oliver (Screenwriter, Director, Producer and Showrunner), Stacy L. Smith (Founder, \u201cUSC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative\u201d), and Sumi Parekh (Executive Director, \u201cGroup Effort Initiative\u201d). Also, a \u201cMaster Class in Marketing\u201d which will dive into the world of film promotion with industry leaders will explore the art of capturing audience attention.\n\nNew AI-powered innovations in Adobe Premiere Pro: Solving key community pain points\n\nAdobe\u2019s creative tools are fundamental to the work of Sundance filmmakers. According to the annual Sundance Institute survey, nearly 85 percent of 2025's entrants relied on Adobe Creative Cloud applications \u2014 including Premiere Pro, Frame.io, After Effects, Photoshop and the Substance 3D Collection \u2014 to bring their stories to life. Premiere Pro was yet again the most popular video editing software, used by over half (60 percent) of this year's films. \u201cOpus,\u201d \"By Design,\" \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d \u201cBunnylovr,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\" \"Bucks County, USA\" and \"The Legend of Ochi\" are just a few of the narrative features, documentaries and episodic series set to debut at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival that were cut on Premiere Pro.\n\nAhead of the festival, we unveiled new innovations designed to empower filmmakers at all levels, whether they\u2019re an aspiring student, indie filmmaker, documentarian or industry veteran. The new AI-powered media intelligence and search panel in Adobe Premiere Pro (beta) addresses a monumental pain point for video editors by letting them quickly locate the perfect film clip from massive libraries of files \u2014 a frequent inconvenience that previously meant sifting through gigabytes of files in search of a specific clip. Premiere Pro also now offers new AI-powered caption translation (beta) that automates the often expensive and inefficient process of multilingual caption generation, helping video pros effortlessly connect with audiences worldwide. Plus, new After Effects enhancements (currently in beta), and Frame.io Camera to Cloud connectivity with Canon EOS C80 and EOS C400 available now, will help accelerate post-production workflows and enhance storytelling capabilities, while reducing technical complexities and empowering creators to bring their visions to life faster and more effectively.\n\nAdobe Film & TV Fund: Supporting underrepresented filmmakers\n\nToday, Adobe announced an additional $5M commitment to the Adobe Film & TV Fund, an initiative that launched in 2024 to empower underrepresented filmmakers by providing resources, mentorship, and career opportunities both in front of and behind the camera. Three filmmakers who were supported through the Adobe Film & TV Fund grant from the Adobe Foundation to The Latinx House last year have films premiering at Sundance \u2014 Mar\u00eda Gabriela Torres, editor of \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d Isabel Castro, director of \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d and Mario Fierro, editor of \u201cSweet Talkin\u2019 Guy.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Adobe Film & TV Fund is partnering with Group Effort Initiative (GEI) to provide Adobe training courses for the next generation of filmmakers, editors and marketers that will be essential for corporate, creative and production jobs in film and television. The collaboration will also support mid-career advancement for diverse professionals through employer engagement, education, training and mentorship to enhance career growth in the entertainment industry.\n\nWe're proud to announce today that we\u2019re bringing back The Inclusion List \u2014 the data-driven study developed by Dr. Stacy L. Smith and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative in collaboration with the Adobe Foundation. The Inclusion List offers an invaluable roadmap of where the industry is making strides and where we still need to work toward true inclusivity. Our collaboration with USC\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion List builds on our commitment to supporting and elevating underrepresented voices using a data-driven approach to determine where representation and diversity is prominent within the film industry and analyzing where a greater focus on inclusivity is needed.\n\nIgnite Fellows at Sundance\n\n2025 marks the 10-year anniversary of the Sundance Ignite x Adobe Fellowship. Over 160 fellows have participated in the Sundance x Adobe Fellowships, with many taking their love of filmmaking beyond. By continuing to support diverse voices and providing them with the resources they need to succeed, we\u2019re not just telling stories \u2014 we\u2019re changing the narrative of what the future of filmmaking can be. This year, we\u2019re excited to have two Ignite fellows premiering their films at Sundance, with Aurora Brachman showing \u201cHold Me Close\u201d and Gerardo Coello presenting \u201cSUSANA\u201d.\n\nWe invite all 2025 Sundance Festival attendees to join us for a series of exciting events and panels that will showcase the latest innovations and insights from our team. Be sure to follow us on social media for real-time updates, exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes content throughout the festival. For more information and to stay up to date on all our activities, visit our dedicated Adobe Sundance page. We look forward to connecting with you and sharing unforgettable moments at this year\u2019s event.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Commitment to Los Angeles\n\nWe know that many people across the film industry have been impacted in some way by the devastating Southern California wildfires. In response to the immediate need of those affected by the wildfires, and those in the creative community, the Adobe Foundation has donated $1 million across the California Community Foundation: Wildfire Recovery Fund and the Entertainment Community Fund. If you are also looking for ways to support, we will match your donations to these incredible organizations at 100 percent.",

At its House of Energy, Acura partners with the Ambriz Brothers (Mexican writers, directors, producers and founders of Cinema Fantasma, a stop-motion studio). They will bring the inspiration behind the 2025 ADX (an Acura SUV) to life. The Ambriz\u2019s exclusive collaboration will be in the center of the space, \u201cbringing together the pulse of Acura design and engineering innovation with a stunning new visual tribute to the synergy of motion and art.\u201d\n\nAdobe\n\nThe brand, marking 14 years of support, welcomes festival-goers to The Adobe House for a community breakfast workshop. Participants will be the first to see prototypes of what\u2019s coming in the year ahead from the Adobe team behind Premiere Pro. Afterwards, they will gather into small groups \u201cto brainstorm and shape the future.\u201d",

            "content": "In today\u2019s fast-paced business environment, the integration of advanced technologies into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems is essential for organizations aiming to optimize their operations. Adobe and Microsoft recently partnered to extend AI agents in Adobe Experience Cloud and related tools like Adobe Customer Journey and Adobe Workfront into Microsoft applications like Teams, PowerPoint, and Word via Copilot.\n\nAlthough primarily aimed at marketers, the implications for ERP users are also important. The agent facilitates a seamless workflow by allowing users to operate within their preferred Microsoft applications, streamlining workflows and extending AI reach across platforms. This minimizes disruptions that can occur when toggling between multiple software solutions.\n\nThe Adobe Marketing Agent harnesses the power of generative AI to assist users in managing vast datasets and workflows without the need for constant application switching. By integrating with Microsoft 365, it allows users to access necessary operations and insights in a familiar environment, thus improving overall efficiency and reducing the time to complete key business processes.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nAdditionally, the Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant further empowers users by providing operational insights in a conversational format. This tool enables users to extract valuable data and metadata from the Adobe Experience Platform directly into their workflow, facilitating easier access to critical information for better decision-making. Increased ease of access to this kind of data is key not only for marketers but also for ERP end users.\n\nThe integration of Adobe Customer Journey Analytics within this framework allows users to interact with data in innovative ways. By utilizing natural language queries, users can gain immediate insights that are crucial for strategic planning. For example, generating performance reports or analyzing resource utilization can be done directly in PowerPoint, ensuring that stakeholders have access to real-time data without the cumbersome process of manual data compilation.\n\nThis partnership extends to Adobe Workfront, which enhances project management capabilities for ERP and other business and IT end users. The integration allows for the summarization of tasks, monitoring of project health, and easy access to project-related documents\u2014all from within Microsoft 365, enabling efficient project execution.\n\nLastly, the collaboration between Adobe and Microsoft is set to enhance data management capabilities through the Federated Audience Composition feature in Adobe Experience Platform. This capability allows users to access and utilize critical datasets directly from Microsoft Fabric, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure while still being accessible for decision-making processes.\n\nAs ERP users look to modernize their systems and improve operational efficiencies, the innovations from Adobe and Microsoft present a compelling case for AI-powered integration of platforms and systems. By deploying agentic AI across systems, users can quickly gain speed and efficiency for daily tasks.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nAgentic AI will impact every workflow and process. Agentic AI will impact every ERP-related workflow and process. Technology and business leaders need to rethink their critical workflows and adapt them to the changes agentic AI will bring to tasks and data flow.\n\nData silos will break with Agentic AI. In an SAPinsider survey, cloud analytics capabilities that unite data from disparate sources were rated \u201cvery important\u201d by 37% of the respondents underscoring the importance for businesses to invest in robust cloud analytics solutions that facilitate self-service and data integration. Solutions that use agentic AI across platforms will break down silos of data across different systems, to unify it for stronger analytics. This will fundamentally change both the nature and speed with which ERP end users and other business professionals can make data-driven decisions.\n\nProject management will finally move closer to real-time. Agentic AI integration across platforms finally promises to move project management from behind the frontlines of work to capture progress across different projects and departments with greater speed. It will likely make project-based work more transparent to senior managers and decision makers.",

By comparing genetic mutations to epigenetic modifications, they found that mutations were predictably correlated with changes in DNA methylation, one type of epigenetic modification. They found that a single mutation could cause a cascade of epigenetic changes across the genome, not just where the mutation occurred. Using this relationship, the researchers were able to make similar predictions of age using either mutations or epigenetic changes.\n\n\u201cEpigenetic clocks have been around for years, but we\u2019re only now beginning to answer the question of why epigenetic clocks tick in the first place,\u201d said first author Zane Koch, a Ph.D. candidate in bioinformatics at UC San Diego. \u201cOur study demonstrates for the first time that epigenetic changes are intricately and predictably tied to random genetic mutations.\u201d\n\nThe study's authors note that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between somatic mutations and epigenetic changes in aging. However, the study's findings provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of the aging process and have important implications for the development of new therapies aimed at preventing or reversing aging.\n\n\"If somatic mutations are the fundamental driver of aging and epigenetic changes simply track this process, it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to reverse aging than we previously thought,\" added co-corresponding author Steven Cummings, M.D., executive director of the San Francisco Coordinating Center at UC San Francisco and senior research scientist at Sutter Health\u2019s California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute. \u201cThis shifts our focus from viewing aging as a programmed process to one that's largely influenced by random, cumulative changes over time.\u201d",

We sat down with Khatami to learn more about his workflow on this ambitious feature, seven years in the making. Read on for more below.\n\nHow did you first get involved with this project?\n\nThe journey started unexpectedly when I was sent a novel to consider for adaptation. Ten pages in, I was bored. The story wasn\u2019t connecting with me, so I impulsively started sketching my own treatment. What began as a quick distraction gradually morphed into an autofictional script\u2014a deeply personal story drawn from my own life.\n\nThat was back in 2018. Seven years, countless drafts, and one pandemic later, we\u2019re in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition at Sundance.\n\nWhere were you when you found out you got into Sundance? How did you feel?\n\nI was at home, refreshing my email like a nervous teenager waiting for a college acceptance letter. When the confirmation came, I felt relieved, like a giant weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nBut then the nerves hit. This is such a personal story, and the thought of sharing it with the world was both thrilling and terrifying. It\u2019s one thing to make a film; it\u2019s another to hand it over to an audience.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nI shoot economically, so there aren\u2019t many options for cutting a scene\u2014it\u2019s already edited in my head before I sit down at the timeline. When I start, my focus is on getting the flow and rhythm of each scene right. Scene by scene, I refine, trying not to obsess over the larger story too soon.\n\nOnce the scenes are individually polished, I begin the real work: discovering their order. That\u2019s when the characters\u2019 arcs and the story\u2019s emotional beats come into focus. Editing is like solving a puzzle\u2014you know the pieces fit, but you have to figure out how.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nThere\u2019s a confession scene at the heart of the film that nearly broke me. It has one long take, and while it anchors the moment emotionally, we needed to carefully build the tension leading up to it. We had two simple setups, but deciding which lines should be on-camera versus off-camera was complex.\n\nIn the end, it became a dance of timing, perspective, and nuance. When it finally clicked, the scene felt alive.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nThe editing process for \u201cThe Things You Kill\u201d started on set, where my co-editor, Selda Taskin, and I spent two hours each evening assembling and reviewing footage. This real-time editing helped us stay on track creatively. By the end of production, we had a complete rough cut. Post-production continued remotely for nearly four months, with me in Toronto and Selda in Istanbul.\n\nTo manage resources, we avoided fancy tools and instead shared low-res backups and Adobe file versions. It was a scrappy but effective solution. Subtitles, a major challenge for our multilingual film, were handled smoothly using Premiere Pro\u2019s caption tracks, allowing us to shuffle between languages effortlessly. It\u2019s a simple yet effective tool.\n\nPremiere Pro was our go-to for editing, thanks to its speed and stability. After Effects was critical for the complex visual effects we needed, and Photoshop helped us with key assets for the title design. I\u2019ve been using Adobe tools since I was a teenager, so the familiarity was a huge bonus. They made it possible to juggle all the creative demands of this project without losing momentum.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nMaster Nested Sequences. They\u2019re like editing superpowers. They let you focus on the big picture without getting bogged down by details. Plus, they\u2019re great for keeping your timeline clean and your sanity intact.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nThe classic Persian poets. Their mastery of rhythm, structure, and emotional depth feels like a masterclass in editing. They create awe-inspiring moments not with visuals but with the power of words and timing.\n\nI try to bring that same sense of poetry into my films\u2014finding the emotional beats that linger long after the story ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s something tough you\u2019ve had to face in your career, and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nNavigating the blunt Orientalism often imposed on Middle Eastern filmmakers has been an ongoing challenge. I\u2019ve had to learn to say no and stand my ground, even if it meant waiting years to make the film I truly believed in.\n\nMy advice? Make a film that scares the hell out of you. And if you\u2019re an editor, learn to dance. It\u2019ll teach you rhythm, timing, and the art of gracefully stepping on toes when necessary.",

And I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\n\n\nIn this article I'll take you through my journey from Adobe to Da Vinci Resolve.\n\nMy Adobe days\n\nIn the 2000s the high-end of film and ad work was largely dominated by Avid. Getting time on an Avid was very expensive, hundreds per hour if memory serves. And then even more if you needed an editor. The only reason I happen to get time on it was because I knew the fellow who opened the very first Avid room in NYC, in partnership with the huge Post Perfect production house in midtown. I did his early advertising work, and he cut me some time in one of his two or three Avid rooms.\n\nI no longer recall all of the issues, but let me say, working with an Avid back then was not easy. Getting static images from Photoshop into the Avid was a royal pain. So when Adobe released their re-written \u201cPRO\u201d version of Premiere, a version that we were told would actually work compared to the original incarnation, well, we were all happy to give it a whirl.\n\nFor Adobe, \"The Social Network\" was their intro to Hollywood.\n\nPlus, Premiere Pro could integrate with the other gem in Adobe\u2019s offerings: After Effects. And with their \u201cAdobe Dynamic Link\u201d functionality that came out some time later, we could shuttle clips back and forth from editor, to compositor, and back again. And hey, on good days, it actually worked. And on great days, it didn\u2019t crash our systems!\n\nAnd by 2010 the push was on. Adobe\u2019s editing tools were used for big screen movies. The first, and the one that Adobe marketed the heck out of, was \u201cThe Social Network\u201d. After which it seemed the Non-Linear Editing (NLE) race was in full swing\n\nAcross the 2010s digital companies like Adobe and Apple were buying up tools to cater to both Hollywood, and the growing film making world beyond it. Like the indie filmmakers. Apple scooped up the high-end compositor Shake, which it would later kill off. And Adobe scooped up Speedgrade, a high-end color corrections tool, that it too would later kill off after making its way into just one version of Adobe\u2019s Creative Suite.\n\nAdobe also purchased a suite of very cool tools from a company called \u201cSerious Magic\u201d. Their Ultra was a virtual set system. And their OnLocation allowed recording video direct to your hard drives. Both were included in an early Creative Suite release. And then also soon killed off, never to be seen again.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single creative that hasn\u2019t been shell-shocked by all of the software the major players have killed off over the years. To say it\u2019s been exhausting, wouldn\u2019t even start to cover it. It has also been financially bankrupting for many who have built careers and businesses on software that is soon after buried.\n\nWhen tools are a major part of your business, you don\u2019t change them out without good reason. This is true with construction tools, farming tools, and our own digital tools. You have to have a sound basis for taking that risk. Usually, you have to have more than one lone reason.\n\nFor me, the initial reason I even began to consider moving off of Adobe editing tools was my long-term goal of moving off Windows and on to Linux. And Adobe simply isn\u2019t an option on that platform. But as I type this, I realize that is a bit disingenuous, right? I mean, if Adobe and its tools are that important to me, I would just stay on Windows, or move back to a Mac, right? So there has to be more to it, and there is.\n\nMost of us are tired of the games big-tech plays on us.\n\nI\u2019m tired of the issues discussed above. I\u2019m tired of the Mac OS telling us where we can place the trash can (they even sued an extension dev over it!). And of Windows putting ads on my desktop. And like many others, I am tired of all of Adobe\u2019s games. From killing software we have all invested years into, to subscriptions. And their ever increasing prices during an era when the actual value of their tools is going down, not up.\n\nA project that used most of Davinci Resolve's modules. (Image credit: Black Magic)\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for many years for open source creative tools to be ready for the high-end work I built my career on. Tools like GIMP, Krita (see our GIMP vs Krita and GIMP vs Photoshop articles), Inkscape, and the wonderful Linux platform itself. I was assuming that I\u2019d find one of the many NLEs available on Linux, and get up to speed with the compositor Natron, which had been under steady development (alas, no longer the case).\n\nBut then more and more colleagues and friends were talking about DaVinci Resolve (DVR). And some years back I had a gig working with a fellow who showed me what it could do. Both its tracking tools and color correction blew me away. And then I learned, they have a version on Linux!\n\nWhat I noticed about DaVinci Resolve\n\nI do not jump fast. My move to a new platform started by putting Ubuntu Studio on my laptop almost two years ago. Then building a new Linux workstation this past year. Along that time I was also learning more about DaVinci, yes. But also about the company that makes it, Blackmagic.\n\nI learned that the difference between their free version of DVR and their paid one was, amazingly small. They were not, excuse the expression, yanking anyone\u2019s chain as is so often the case. The free version was totally and fully usable.\n\nBlackmagic doesn't seem to jerk its customers chains. And this makes a huge difference!\n\nAnd that should someone really need the few extra functions of the paid \u201cStudio\u201d version, purchasing that was only $300. A ONE-TIME cost. Those extra functions were so few, that I have been playing with it on smaller projects for about a year, and only just decided to install the Studio version because I needed to import using its 265 codec, only available in the studio version. Otherwise, I would have stayed on the free offering.\n\nJust $300 for an application like this? There must be a catch, I assumed. But talking to friends, I was assured, there was no catch. And in fact one told me he jumped on almost a decade ago and they have never once even asked for any upgrade fee for any of the major releases across all those years.\n\nThis was a real head-scratcher.\n\nJumping In\n\nAs mentioned, I had only done very small, short form work in DVR until now. A project that I just recently did in it involved more. Still under 10 minutes, but it involved far more color correction, audio sweetening, and video/text treatments. Nothing I had done in DVR yet.\n\nIn the Adobe suite all of this would have meant jumping from Premiere, to some After Effects work, and over to Audition for the audio work. All of that jumping around from one application to another, and back again sounds really daunting. And I can tell you that after years of that being my normal workflow for video work, I still held my breath before each leap. Knowing that there was always the possibility it may not work, it may crash one or more apps (save first!), or the data may corrupt along the way.\n\nDaVinci Resolve has all of those capabilities, editing, compositing, audio and more. And all within the same application. Each specialty is represented across its seven \u201ctabs\u201d. They include:\n\nMedia:\n\nA bit like Adobe\u2019s Bridge, where you can select, manage and import your media.\n\nCut:\n\nThis is a quick cuts timeline designed for on location and dailies. Much like another app Adobe killed off some years ago, Prelude.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe main editor, which is very similar to Premiere, and was easy to jump on to.\n\nFusion:\n\nA video compositor, akin to After Effects. But node based like the high-end Nuke.\n\nColor:\n\nThe industry\u2019s top color correction and sweetening software, with endless controls. Much like SpeedGrade, the package Adobe killed.\n\nFairlight:\n\nA very capable audio editing application.\n\nDeliver:\n\nMuch like Adobe\u2019s Media Encoder app, which controls the final rendering for delivery.\n\nWorking on my recent project in DVR, as I kept adding more 6k clips to the project, and started moving back and forth between Edit and Color and Fairlight, I kept waiting for a hiccup. But not one ever came.\n\nI should mention that my aging Windows box is a whopping decade old! Yes, it\u2019s been upgraded with SSDs and large hard drives, and has 32 GB of ram, and is on its third GPU. But it is still a decade old.\n\nNot only was there no hiccup, there wasn\u2019t even a pause. DaVinci took everything in stride. And everything worked as I would have hoped it to work. Change the color or sound in their respective editing tabs, and it all looked and sounded just as it should when I went back to the Edit tab.\n\nEven on my aging workstation, DaVinci just worked. No hiccups. In fact, it was quite elegant.\n\nThere were no Adobe Dynamic Link slow-downs. No corrupted media, or out of sync issues. Things just worked. That alone would have been magical enough. But there is more.\n\nExporting the file, as I wanted it, was a breeze. This used to be the case with Premiere or After Effects, years ago. But anyone who\u2019s used their video tools a while will remember how at some point they stripped most of the output tools out of Premiere and After Effects, and moved it to Media Encoder. So that when ME had its own issues at some point, we were all stuck missing deadlines.\n\nAgain, using DVR\u2019s Deliver module just worked. Smoothly, and quickly. And the output looked marvellous. And on the first render!\n\nThe software is, simply put, quite elegant. For all of its vast toolset, and capability, to look at it on your screen one might expect a busier and more cluttered interface. But it is surprisingly clean. Which had in turn helped make the learning process so much easier, faster, and pleasant.\n\nIf only it were Open Source!\n\nAs mentioned, I\u2019ve been wanting to go all open source. I no longer want to play all the silly games big tech continues to foist upon us day after year. But Blackmagic is making me think I may make an exception.\n\nAfter all, I can\u2019t see that they play those games. They seem to have been playing it straight with their user base for a long time now. Free software that actually works, and isn\u2019t bait and switch. A crazy low ONE-TIME purchase price for the Studio version. And no upgrade costs as they roll out new versions.\n\nI'm going to make just one exception to my \"All Open Source\" decision.\n\nAnd of course, they make it for Mac, Windows and yes, even Linux. So I may break my plans of going fully open source and include DaVinci Resolve. Because if my experience has been this good on my aging Windows box, I can\u2019t wait to see it fly on my much faster Linux machine. I\u2019ll keep you all posted.\n\nFor more details, see our in-depth Premiere Pro 2024 review and our DaVinci Resolve 19 review. See below for software pricing.

Nitro PDF Pro Get more out of your documents Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Windows, macOS Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals Check Amazon VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Seamless integrations + E-signature workflows + Great collaboration tools Reasons to avoid - Support ticket system restricted to VIP/Premium - Annual subscription only\n\nNitro PDF Pro is probably the best Acrobat alternative for those who want a professional-grade toolset at a comparable price. When we tried out the product, we found it featured an impressive toolkit that compares favorably with Adobe Acrobat. The interface and experience make using the software incredibly simple and easy - a factor the sometimes overwhelming Acrobat struggles to boast.\n\nOther tools to let you make changes to existing PDF documents, and even create one from scratch. You have a lot of tools at your disposal, including various ways to make annotations, leaving instructions for colleagues to follow.\n\nEditing the actual content of an already existing PDF isn\u2019t as seamless as we\u2019d like it to be, and that\u2019s probably the weakest tool in Nitro\u2019s arsenal. Everything else is very well implemented, and we especially liked how the ability to convert files to and from PDFs is performed.\n\nUltimately, we found this Adobe Acrobat alternative offered a great range of editing and manipulation tools, alongside a host of extras like OCR and conversion tools.\n\nRead our full Nitro PDF Pro review\n\nBest free alternative to Adobe Acrobat\n\n(Image credit: PDF24 Tools)\n\n2. PDF24 A streamlined PDF creator and editor offered for free Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Windows Plan: Free Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Free and unlimited + Works well on low-end PCs + Fast, lightweight app + Powerful editing tools Reasons to avoid - Windows only - Can be clunky at times\n\nPDF24 isn\u2019t just one of the best Adobe Acrobat alternatives for Windows - it\u2019s also our top pick for best free PDF editor overall.\n\nDespite the no-cost approach, the tool - a PC-only desktop app that works offline and is ideal for low-spec PCs - is surprisingly feature-rich.\n\nDuring our time with the software, we rated it as \u201cone of the best examples of free tools that go above and beyond. It\u2019s packed full of features, and comes with everything you might need to create and edit a PDF document.\u201d\n\nTools for PDF creation, compressing, merging, and converting are all present and results are grand. Extras like OCR and eSign are well-implemented. The interface is clean and fresh and emphasizes productivity - you can quickly find what you need and what to do.\n\nWe even felt it bested Adobe in one area. Praising Acrobat for its inclusion of tools for almost use-cases, we noted, \u201cthe only exception is if you need something more advanced for filling out forms, in which case an editor like PDF24 or PDFZilla could work better, despite looking a bit clunkier.\u201d\n\nPDF24 is available free and unlimited. The experience might not quite match Adobe\u2019s fluid workflow, but it\u2019s a price you can\u2019t beat.\n\nRead our full PDF24 Creator review\n\nBest subscription-free Adobe Acrobat alternative\n\n(Image credit: Foxit)\n\nFoxit PDF Editor is a stellar substitute for Adobe Acrobat. Like Adobe, Foxit has been offering PDF tools for decades, and users can take confidence from the many high-profile endorsements proudly listed on the Foxit site, with the likes of Amazon, Google, Dell, and Intel among them.\n\nThe company's best Adobe Acrobat alternative, Foxit PDF Editor, offers dozens of useful features. This includes watermarking, adding headers and footers, tailoring password permissions, creating templates, and converting other documents to PDFs. One neat feature is being able to drag files of other formats - such as converting Excel to PDF or using the PowerPoint to PDF converter.\n\nIn our Foxit PDF Editor review, we felt it might not offer enough value to casual users, but the multi-platform PDF editor app was great for businesses who regularly need to manipulate, edit, redact, annotate, and alter PDF documents.\n\nIndeed, the redaction tools were a special highlight for us. We were impressed with how easily they worked, thoroughly scrubbing sensitive data from documents .The feature is a boon for compliant-conscious teams who understand the importance of adhering to global data laws.\n\nPricing for Foxit PDF Editor is flexible, with monthly and yearly subscriptions. If on-going payments are one of the reasons you\u2019re looking for the best Adobe Acrobat alternatives, there\u2019s the opportunity to pick up a perpetual license for a one-off purchase.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find two upgraded versions of the PDF editing software - Pro and Pro + - which add additional features for power-users.\n\nRead our full Foxit PDF Editor review\n\nBest Adobe Acrobat alternative for document management\n\n(Image credit: DocHub)\n\n4. DocHub A full suit of PDF and document management tools Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Web Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Price + Intuitive interface + Good editing and management tools Reasons to avoid - Online only - Free plan is limited\n\nOne of the great things about Acrobat is the software\u2019s all-in-one nature. Just about every tool you need for most document management needs is right there - from editing and sharing PDF files to storing electronic signatures and digital contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s those sort of features you\u2019ll find across DocHub. There\u2019s plenty going on here, with a full PDF editor and reader, eSignature and form-filling tools, and Google and Dropbox integration. For most document management uses, there\u2019s plenty to recommend it. It lacks the wide and seamless integration with Creative Cloud apps that you find with Adobe Acrobat. But that shouldn\u2019t prove a problem if you\u2019re not already in that ecosystem.\n\nThere is a free version and a free trial, although these are pretty limited in our experience. More of a taster, with a generous set of features locked behind a subscription plan. However, it\u2019s price is very reasonable for what\u2019s on offer - and nicely simple, too at $14 a month or $10 a month paid yearly.\n\nRead our full DocHub review\n\nBest Adobe Acrobat alternative for Windows\n\n(Image credit: EaseUSup)\n\nEaseUS PDF Editor is the ideal choice if you\u2019re on a PC - it\u2019s one of the best alternatives to Adobe Acrobat for Windows.\n\nUnlike many of the best Acrobat alternatives, EaseUS has a free, but limited version available alongside the Pro version. This works great in a pinch, but it restricted in many ways - not least adding a watermark to your documents. The Pro version opens up the software, however.\n\nIn our review, we described EaseUS\u2019 offering as \u201ca powerful, PC-only PDF editing software tool that allows you to manipulate and alter documents with relative ease. It also comes with more standard features, such as a converter, and has good OCR capabilities.\u201d Elsewhere, you\u2019ll find outstanding PDF converter tools and eSignature tools.\n\nThe program is impressively kitted out for PDF editing, splitting pages into boxes that can be moved and resized. Content can also be changed, such as altering the font, color, and the text itself.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all housed within a refreshingly clean user interface. This makes navigating the tool an absolute breeze - not dissimilar to the excellent user experience offered in Adobe Acrobat, with its focus on maximizing productivity.\n\nCosts for EaseUS PDF editor vary, with monthly and annual subscriptions and a one-time-buy \u2018lifetime upgrade\u2019 option. It\u2019s \u2018one license for one computer\u2019. Bundles are available.\n\nRead our full EaseUS PDF Editor review\n\nBest Acrobat alternative for Mac, iPad, and iPhone\n\n(Image credit: Readdle)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best Adobe Acrobat alternative for Mac, iPad, and iPhone, look no further than Readdle PDF Expert.\n\nWhile modern Apple machines come preinstalled with the excellent Apple Preview - a tool we felt \u201cshould be able to cater to all but the most demanding PDF road warriors\u201d - it\u2019s more of a PDF reader and manipulator, rather than a full PDF editor, like Acrobat.\n\nPDF Expert is much more fully featured, making it a much better alternative to Acrobat. Alongside image and text editing, Readdle\u2019s product also comes kitted out with converter tools for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, OCR and eSign tools.\n\nWhen we tested out the software, we were impressed to find it \u201chas lots of useful features for people who use PDF files on a regular basis. It has a very clean UI design and everything is neatly organized so you don\u2019t need a lot of help in understanding how the software works when you use it for the first time.\u201d We also loved how well PDF Expert synced documents on all Apple devices.\n\nA wide range of editing tools include the ability to highlight parts of the PDF and add notes, redact sensitive information, extract or rearrange pages, and merge documents. Being able to draw directly onto the PDF is also useful for those who are using the software on iPad and have an Apple Pencil.\n\nThe sleek interface and a well-organized toolbar make it simple and intuitive for new users to accomplish everyday PDF editing tasks. In short, PDF Expert makes you feel like a PDF expert.\n\nPricing is via an annual subscription or a perpetual license - however, only the yearly fee offers use across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nRead our full Readdle PDF Expert review\n\nBest Acrobat alternative for mobile\n\n(Image credit: airSlate)\n\n7. pdfFiller Great for online and mobile devices Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Web, Android, iOS Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Web and mobile support + Loads of PDF features + Good collaboration tools + Security tools Reasons to avoid - Price - Advanced tools have steeper learning curve - Cancelling subscription can be confusing\n\nIf you want to switch out Acrobat for another full document management suite pdfFiller is worth consideration. It does all the expected PDF editing extras that you\u2019d expect - and performs excellently at the task. But there\u2019s a lot more going on with this online and mobile tool.\n\nDuring our review, we were pleased to find a raft of features beyond PDF creation and management, including support for fillable forms, electronic signatures, and even payments. Of most interest to businesses will be the encryption and security features for handling sensitive data in files.\n\nThe main tool is available online, with Android and iOS apps for when you need to make adjustments on the go. These apps aren\u2019t as feature-rich as the browser version, but they work great and are a welcome addition. There\u2019s no free version available here, although you can start a free trial. Instead, you\u2019ll find three monthly/yearly subscription plans - Basic, Plus, and Premium. A range of features are unlocked at each tier.\n\nRead our full pdfFiller review\n\nBest Acrobat alternative for low-spec PCs\n\n(Image credit: PDFForge)\n\n8. PDF Architect Go beyond creating PDFs Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Windows Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Great value for money + OCR scanning + Free PDF app available Reasons to avoid - No editing on free version - Requires 'modules' to add certain features\n\nPDF Architect, from pdfforge, offers a range of PDF packages that rival Adobe Acrobat. The free plan includes basic PDF creation for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint docs, and the ability to merge, move, and delete pages and files.\n\nMore advanced features rest in the Standard, Professional, and Pro + OCR plans. These open up necessary editing, converting, collaboration tools, and more. When we took a look at PDF Architect, we awarded it 4 stars, calling it \u201ca great choice for those who need a reliable, advanced PDF editor with lots of extra features and a stable, reliable interface.\u201d\n\nWe appreciated the excellent interface, which will be familiar to anyone used to Microsoft Office software, and the extensive toolkit - praising the developers for \u201cresearching the market and identifying underserved niches.\u201d Best of all, with minimal system requirements, PDF Architect is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Acrobat for low-end, low-spec computers.\n\nHowever, there are limitations, even beyond the free version. eSignatures, for example, require a separate module in the PDF editor. For that reason, we recommend a free trial to get a feel for what you can and can\u2019t do, to see if it fits your current workflow.\n\n\n\nRead our full pdfforge PDF Architect review .\n\nBest free Adobe Acrobat alternative online\n\n(Image credit: Sejda)\n\n9. Sejda A convincingly powerful app Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Web, Windows, Mac, Linux Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Free to use + Manipulate PDFs in your browser + Multi-platform desktop app Reasons to avoid - Editing function is limited - Restrictions on free version\n\nFor those with a need to edit PDFs online and on a budget, Sejda offers a tool that might just be the best free Acrobat alternative online.\n\nIt\u2019s available as a desktop version that saves files locally to your computer or an online version that uses cloud storage. But watch out for restrictions in the free version. You can only perform three tasks per day, you can only work on one document at a time, and file sizes cannot exceed 200 pages or 50MB.\n\nOne of Sejda\u2019s real highlights is its security process. All files uploaded to the server are automatically deleted after two hours. Ideal, then, for businesses with a focus on data protection and compliance.\n\nThe tool isn\u2019t without its faults, though. We found in-document text editing to be fairly basic, meaning you might encounter some issues replicating a typeface if the original PDF features a unique or unusual font. But as a useful Adobe Acrobat alternative for infrequent PDF editing, Sejda offers an excellent no-cost or low-cost option.\n\nAs we noted when we reviewed the software, it\u2019s \u201ca convincingly powerful PDF editor, but you'll need to pay if you need to use it a lot.\u201d\n\nPricing comes in the form of a weekly and monthly subscriptions for the web app, or an annual desktop and web app subscription. Team and volume licensing is available.\n\nRead our full Sejda review\n\nBest Adobe Acrobat alternative FAQs\n\nWhat is a PDF? PDF is an acronym for Portable Document Format. The filetype was invented by Adobe and designed to look identical across different devices and screens - so, it retains consistency and maintains accuracy without formatting issues. However, because it\u2019s standardized, it also means it can\u2019t be edited without the use of a PDF editor like Adobe Acrobat.\n\nWhat is Adobe Acrobat? Adobe Acrobat is a PDF editor for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Unlike document readers, PDF editing software lets users create, edit, and annotate PDF documents that can easily be shared and viewed by others. It\u2019s often considered the industry standard in PDF editing software. Not only did the company design the PDF format, but also introduced a range of tools so businesses can easily build and modify documents\n\nWhy do I need the best Adobe Acrobat alternative? While you can use any PDF tool that fits your workflow (and creative flow), the best Acrobat alternatives deliver similarly effortless interfaces and experiences as Adobe's app - without the need for a Creative Cloud subscription. Although Acrobat remains the obvious choice for editing PDFs, and is often considered the industry standard PDF editor, it might not fit your overall workflow, meet your needs, or your budget. This is especially true if you\u2019re not a power-user; if you\u2019re not a PDF power-user, alternatives may meet your needs better.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Adobe Acrobat DC, Acrobat Pro DC, and Adobe Reader DC? Adobe offers three PDF apps for a range of users and uses. When looking for the best alternative to Acrobat, it's worth knowing exactly which Adobe tool needs replacing. Acrobat Reader is one of the best free PDF readers for viewing, annotating, and printing files. It lacks tools like editing and document conversion. Acrobat DC is a Windows-only app, and part of Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription package. It features all the expected tools and features of a PDF editor. Acrobat Pro DC, for Windows and Mac, has all the same features as Acrobat DC, but adds extra tools like editing and searching scanned files and adding media to documents.\n\nHow to choose the best Adobe Acrobat alternative for you\n\nWhen deciding which Adobe Acrobat alternative is best for you, you first need to consider how you will be working with PDF files.\n\nModern operating systems and the best browsers can open PDFs without additional software, meaning this is all you need if you only want to view the files.\n\nYou can make basic edits using a PDF reader, many of which are available as free versions. You'll also find plenty of PDF editors that have fewer features than Acrobat, making them the ideal choice for casual users or those who don't need anything too complex. If you need to make more in-depth edits, batch process files, or convert between file types, then a fully-fledged PDF editor is the best choice for you. For a fuller experience, see our reviews of the best document management software.\n\nAlso consider cost. Adobe Acrobat is only available as a subscription service - but alternatives to Acrobat are available on subscription and perpetual license (so you buy it once and own it forever). Some are even available free of charge.\n\nHow we test the best Adobe Acrobat alternatives\n\nWe've tested hundreds of document creation and editing tools, including the best PDF readers for Windows , the best PDF readers for Mac, and even feature-focused programs like the the best PDF compressors and best PDF merger software. So, when it comes to alternatives to Acrobat, we know what to look out for and what to avoid.\n\nFor a full comparison, we've explored each of Adobe's three PDF editor apps in our Acrobat Reader review, Acrobat Pro review, and Adobe Acrobat Standard review.\n\nTo test the best Adobe Acrobat alternatives, we downloaded and installed each piece of software to give you a first-hand opinion based on extensive experience with every kind of PDF editing tool, from feature-rich software for businesses to simple PDF viewers.\n\nOur research looked at operating system compatibility, system requirements, and real-world performance when working with large files.

            "content": "Worried about your job in graphic design? If not, then maybe you should be. Because the latest Future of Jobs Report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) has delivered sobering news for the profession.\n\nThe 2025 report surveyed 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers across 55 countries and identified graphic design as the 11th fastest-declining job category over the next five years.\n\nThat's a stark turnaround from the previous report, which categorised graphic design as a \"moderately growing\" profession. And there are no prizes for guessing the main culprit.\n\nYes, it's AI, and this technology increases the capability to perform knowledge-based work, including creative tasks traditionally handled by human designers.\n\nFrom the horse's mouth\n\nThe warning signals extend beyond the WEF report. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's recently tweeted that, \"Soon, AI tools will do what only very talented humans can do today. (I expect this to go mostly in the counter-intuitive order--creative fields first, cognitive labour next, and physical labour last.) Great for society; not always great for individual jobs.\"\n\nIn a linked tweet, he wrote: \"Using artists as an example, when anyone can create amazing art, there will be incredible upside for humanity, but downside for most individual artists [...] Artists will be much more productive and have new capabilities, but the barrier to entry will be much lower. And as the tools get better, 'regular people' will be able to do almost anything they want themselves.\n\n\"Eventually this will happen almost everywhere [...] This transformation, while potentially beneficial for society at large, poses significant challenges for individual practitioners in the field.\"\n\nSo there you have it. Both business leaders and the AI industry itself agree: AI is coming for your jobs, and no one is safe.\n\nNot all bad news\n\nThat said, it's not all bad news. The WEF report suggests that while traditional graphic design roles may decline, the broader design field shows promising growth in other areas. Most notably, UI and UX design ranks as the eighth fastest-growing job category, indicating a shift in demand rather than an overall decline in design-related work.\n\nPlus, as we've been saying for some time now, graphic design isn't really about being able to \"use Photoshop\"; it's about applying the skills of creative thinking to real-world problems. And according to the report, that's something that humans remain much better at.\n\nEmployers consistently rated AI's ability to replicate creative thinking as \"very low\" or \"low\", with creative thinking ranking fourth among skills expected to grow in importance by 2030. This suggests that while AI may automate certain technical aspects of design work, human creativity remains difficult to replace.\n\nHowever, this optimism comes with a caveat. While employers believe AI has a limited capacity to replicate creative thinking, they express more confidence in AI's ability to perform design and user experience tasks. In other words, while the demand for \"pure\" creativity is likely to remain, the technical execution of design work may increasingly be automated.\n\nNot just designers\n\nWe should remember, of course, that it's not just graphic design jobs that are on the line but a whole host of jobs across the broader workforce. The WEF report notes that by 2030, employers expect an even distribution between tasks performed by humans, tech, and human-tech collaboration, compared to the current split where human-only tasks predominate.\n\nThis carries significant implications for employment in general. While 47% of employers plan to transition employees from AI-disrupted roles to other positions, 41% anticipate reducing their workforce as AI capabilities improve.\n\nThis suggests that pretty much everyone in society, not just graphic designers, will need to be proactive in adapting their skills and potentially diversifying their expertise going forward\n\nHow to save your job\n\nSo what can we do? For current and aspiring graphic designers, the report's findings suggest several strategic responses:\n\nDevelop expertise in UI/UX design, which shows strong growth potential Focus on strengthening creative thinking skills that AI currently struggles to replicate Invest in understanding and working with AI tools rather than competing against them Consider specialising in areas where human insight and creativity remain essential Explore opportunities in emerging fields like sustainable design and green technology\n\nOverall, the future of graphic design seems to be one of transformation rather than elimination. While traditional graphic design roles may decline, new opportunities are emerging at the intersection of design, technology, and sustainability.\n\nSuccess in this evolving landscape will likely depend on our ability to adapt, upskill and embrace new technologies while leveraging uniquely human creative capabilities.\n\nThe challenge for the design community lies in navigating this transition period, ensuring that the fundamental principles of good design continue to thrive while embracing new tools and methodologies.",

Knowing that there is a new therapy available will provide hope to patients and their families who have been waiting for new therapeutic options. This new treatment provides an additional opportunity for Canadians with mCRC to slow disease progression,\u201d Barry D. Stein, president and CEO of Colorectal Cancer Canada, stated in a news release.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDA approved fruquintinib for the treatment of adult patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy; an anti-VEGF therapy; and, if RAS wild-type and medically appropriate, an anti-EGFR therapy.2 This approval was also supported by data from FRESCO-2 and FRESCO.\n\nFRESCO-2 Data\n\nFindings from the international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled FRESCO-2 trial showed that patients randomly assigned to receive fruquintinib (n = 461) experienced a median overall survival (OS) of 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7-8.2) vs 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.0-5.8) for those randomly assigned to the placebo group (n = 230; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; P < .0001).3\n\nRegarding safety, grade 3 or higher adverse effects (AEs) were reported in 63% of patients who received fruquintinib (n = 456) and 50% of those given placebo (n = 230). The most common grade 3 or higher AEs experienced by patients treated with fruquintinib included hypertension (14%), asthenia (8%), and hand-foot syndrome (6%). One treatment-related death occurred in each group; intestinal perforation led to death in 1 patient in the fruquintinib group, and cardiac arrest led to death in 1 patient in the placebo group.\n\nInvestigators enrolled patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 20 years of age in Japan) with histologically or cytologically documented mCRC who had previously received all standard, approved cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Disease progression on or intolerance to TAS-102, regorafenib, or both was required.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive fruquintinib at 5 mg or matching placebo once per day on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. Best supportive care was also given to patients in both arms. Treatment continued until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation by the physician, or study completion or termination.\n\nOS served as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and safety.\n\nFRESCO Findings\n\nData from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in China showed that patients randomly assigned to receive fruquintinib (n = 278) experienced a median OS of 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2-10.5) vs 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.9-8.1) for those randomly assigned to the placebo arm (n = 138; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P < .001).4 The median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI, 3.7-4.6) in the fruquintinib arm vs 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.8-1.8) in the placebo arm (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34; P < .001).\n\nSafety findings showed that grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 61.2% of patients treated with fruquintinib vs 19.7% of patients given placebo. The rates of serious AEs were 15.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Hospitalization was required for 14.4% of patients in the fruquintinib arm vs 5.1% of patients in the placebo arm.\n\nThe study included patients 18 to 75 years of age with mCRC whose disease had progressed after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and who were naive to a VEGFR inhibitor.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive fruquintinib at 5 mg or placebo once per day on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle.\n\nOS was the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points included PFS, ORR, DCR, and safety.\n\n\u201cFruquintinib represents a new option in the treatment of mCRC. This therapy aims to slow disease progression, with the potential to help extend survival,\u201d Hatim Karachiwala, MD, a medical oncologist at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Alberta, added in the news release.1\n\nReferences",

Findings showed that in 2023, 44.67% of evaluable patients (n = 253) received a bispecific antibody. Prior to the July cutoff data, 54.32% of those patients treated in 2024 (n = 162) received 1 of these agents.\n\nIn an interview with OncLive\u00ae at the 2024 ASH Annual Meeting, Zackon discussed the rationale of the real-world analysis, potential differences between real-world and trial patient populations, the real-world data for the uptake of bispecific antibodies, and the next steps for research.\n\nZackon is a hematologist oncologist in the Department of Medicine with the Albany Med Health System and senior medical director at Ontada in New York.\n\nOncLive: What was the rationale of the real-world study evaluating bispecific antibodies for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma?\n\nZackon: We have seen such a transformation of [multiple myeloma] treatment prolonging and improving lives. [Recently], new entrants into our therapies are called bispecific antibodies. These are antibody treatments that can target both the myeloma cell and [send] T cells directly to the tumor. That's basically how it works.\n\nThe first [FDA] approval [of an bispecific antibody in multiple myeloma] was in October 2022 for teclistamab-cqvy [Tecvayli]. Now we have 3 [FDA-approved] bispecific antibodies, [including] elranatamab-bcmm [Elrexfio] and talquetamab-tgvs [Talvey]. They target some different proteins, [which is how] they get directed to the myeloma cells. Since these are new therapies, they can be complex to deliver.\n\nThis [real-world observational study], to my knowledge, is the first high-level look at the utilization of bispecific antibodies in [patients with multiple myeloma] at the real-world community oncology setting outside of academic centers.\n\nHow did this real-world patient population differ from the clinical trial population?\n\nThis was a very high-level population-based view. We only used what we call structured data within an electronic health record [her]. These [data were from] the US Oncology Network, so a very large network of practices that use this EHR. We looked at the period of time from October 2022 with the first approval, up until July 2024. We looked for patients with multiple myeloma who either had bispecific antibody therapy delivered or had at least 5 lines of therapy because this is currently where bispecifics are used\u2014patients have to have at least 4 lines of therapy.\n\nWe found 564 patients overall: 202 had received bispecific antibody therapy, and the remaining 362 had received [other therapies]. When we looked at that population, we [focused on] those who received it and those who didn't receive it. In terms of utilization, when we look at the first full year, 2023, 45% of the patients in this group received bispecifics. When we look at 2024 up until July, at least proportionally, it was up to 54%. At least we're seeing a fairly significant utilization of bispecific antibodies, which is very encouraging to see at the community level so that patients have full access to these therapies.\n\nWhen we looked at the patient characteristics, we could see that those who received bispecifics tended to be a bit younger. Also, when you look at performance status, those who might be more frail because of other health issues would have a lower performance status or a less favorable one. There were only 9% of patients in the bispecific arm who had an ECOG performance status that was over 1, which is starting to become less favorable, whereas an [ECOG performance status over 1] was 24% in those [not treated with bispecifics], so there seemed to be some differences in at least the patients that were selected for it. Those who could receive a bispecific antibody therapy generally reflect the population of patients who were treated in prospective trials.\n\nWhen we looked at other factors, we did not see any differences in sex or, importantly, race. For example, we know that myeloma occurs with increased incidence in the population of Black patients, who represent approximately 15% of the population. Black patients were receiving bispecifics equally to not receiving bispecifics, and equal to others in the [overall] population. That was good to see. [The Black population] is often underrepresented in prospective trials.\n\nBased on findings from these real-world data, what are the next steps in research?\n\nThe next steps are going to be doing this analysis with more time, perhaps over another couple of years, to more fully see the patterns of care with the bispecific antibodies in a larger population. Importantly, our database is now much more enriched, not just in these structured data, but we have been able to move unstructured data, which is what occurs in a visit note or an attached document, which you generally have to look at. We've been able to use technology and artificial intelligence to take unstructured data into a structured data platform. It's been validated, and we have human abstractors making sure it's valid, as well as bringing in other elements.\n\nThe next iteration of this [analysis] will look much more deeply at those patients who got the bispecifics and the safety experience. We can begin to look at outcomes, and start to talk about, \u2018How does the real-world data compare [with] what we saw in prospective data?\u2019\n\nIt's always important to have that follow-up because the real-world patients are our everyday patients\u2014they're not as selective. Whether that be simply by health or their ability to get to a clinical trial, we know only a relatively small percentage of people get into clinical trials, and it doesn't always represent the [diversity] of America in terms of the patients we see. Therefore, we look forward to reviewing this type of analysis with even more data to give us a better, deeper understanding.\n\nReference\n\nHerms L, Su Z, Paulus J, et al.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nKevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500\u2019s performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally.\n\nHe predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year.\n\nHe also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts\u2019 upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 14.00%\n\nUpside Potential as of January 15: 49.00%\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a software company that is known for its creative products including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat, and Premiere Pro. It has made strides with its Firefly GenAI technology and has been integrating AI capabilities across its Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds. This move aims to enhance user productivity and expand product offerings.\n\nEarlier on 20 November 2024, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss gave a Buy rating on the shares of the company with a price target of $660.00. However, investors expressed concerns about the potential delayed returns from the company\u2019s investments in AI-powered software applications. For this reason, its stock declined following a 2025 revenue forecast of $23.3 to $23.55 billion, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $23.77 billion. Still, Constellation Research\u2019s Ray Wang remains optimistic about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in 2025, due to the company\u2019s strong position as an AI derivative.\n\nThe company launched several AI models in 2024, including Firefly, which powers advanced GenAI capabilities for images, vectors, designs, and videos within core applications like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. AI-driven creativity contributed to record FY2024 revenue of $21.51 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Since its March 2023 beta release, Firefly has generated over 13 billion images.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy increased its holdings in the company, anticipating revenue growth which it expects Firefly to deliver. Here\u2019s what it stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.\u201d\n\nOverall ADBE ranks 4th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "A lot of traditional computing tasks can be handled on a smartphone\u2014albeit on a smaller screen and without the benefit of a mouse and keyboard\u2014and those tasks extend to photo editing. If you have enhancements and tweaks to make to your pictures on the go, your phone is perfectly capable of handling them.\n\nThere are a host of photo editing apps to choose from, including the Apple Photos and Google Photos options that come as part of iOS and Android respectively. Here though we\u2019re going to focus on a company and a name synonymous with image editing on the desktop: Adobe Photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop on phones takes the form of the Photoshop Express Photo Editor, which you can download for free for iOS and Android. You can use it for free, with more advanced features and cloud storage available for $4.99 per month or $34.99 per year (this works separately to a subscription to Photoshop for the desktop).\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Email address Sign up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nUsing Photoshop Express Photo Editor\n\nYou get an extensive set of editing options in Photoshop for mobile. Screenshot: Adobe\n\nDon\u2019t expect the exact features in Photoshop Express Photo Editor on mobile as Photoshop on the desktop: It\u2019s a cut-down, simplified version of Photoshop for smaller screens and less powerful devices. That said, you can still do plenty with your images through this stripped-down interface.\n\nTo get started in the app, tap Photo Editor & Retouch, then pick an image from your phone\u2019s gallery. You can see the range of tools available at the bottom of the screen: Adjustments for tweaking colors and brightness, for example, or Crop for cutting out the parts of the image you don\u2019t need.\n\nThe Heal brush can be used to correct blemishes and inconsistencies in the image\u2014as well as clone or erase certain areas\u2014while Background lets you apply various effects to the background of a picture. The app will attempt to distinguish between the background and anything in the foreground, but you can refine the default selection if needed.\n\nPhotoshop Express Photo Editor comes with AI generation capabilities built in as well: Tap the Insert Objects button, for example, enter a prompt, and you can drop in an AI-generated animal or object anywhere you like. You can keep tweaking the prompts as needed to get something that matches what you need.\n\nThere are numerous other features to explore too: You can apply filters to entire images (like a warm filter or a pop color filter), you can combine images together, you can put stickers, scribbles, and text on top of your pictures, and drop in a wide selection of borders too (swipe left and right to see all the available tools). When you\u2019re happy with how an image is looking, you\u2019ve got numerous options for sharing or saving it.\n\nOther Adobe options for mobile\n\nLightroom is another option for iOS and Android. Screenshot: Adobe\n\nThere is a more fully featured mobile version of Photoshop available too, but you can only get it on iPadOS (not iOS or Android). The app brings support for the PSD format, layers, advanced retouching features, and selection tools. Given the accessories you\u2019ve got with the iPad, like the Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard, the experience isn\u2019t too far off from the desktop version.\n\nAdobe Photoshop for the iPad isn\u2019t free though: You need to be subscribed to a Creative Cloud plan that includes Photoshop, and that will come with the iPad app included. If you don\u2019t use Photoshop on a computer, you can subscribe to Photoshop for the iPad on its own, which will set you back $9.99 a month or $79.99 a year.\n\nThe companion app to Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, is also available for iOS and Android. As with Photoshop Express Photo Editor, you can use a lot of the functionality for free, with a subscription ($4.99 a month or $49.99 a year) getting you more features\u2014such as the healing brush and batch editing. You also get all the premium features if you have a Creative Cloud subscription that includes Photoshop.\n\nWe should also mention Adobe Express, which you can install for iOS and Android. This app is more focused on graphic design and AI-powered art creation, but it\u2019s something to consider if you\u2019re wanting to create images with Adobe software using nothing but your phone. You can apply basic effects and adjustments, combine text and images, crop images to size, and more.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for quickly creating social media posts for example, and you can get started with one of your own images or one of the many templates. It\u2019s separate to the Creative Cloud plans, and can be used for free or with a subscription ($9.99 a month or $99.99 a year)\u2014a subscription gets you more cloud storage, more credits for generating AI images, and more features (such as advanced background removal).",

Our Community Impact Teams (CIT) make up a worldwide network of employees at every level who volunteer their time to coordinate fundraising and volunteering with local nonprofit partners to create change around Adobe offices.\n\nOur CITs empower us all to make a difference together. We\u2019re excited to spotlight one of our incredible employees, Scott Gruer, a Senior Solutions Consultant based in Singapore, who is bringing his unique vision to his role as a CIT Lead:\n\nScott has said that being part of Adobe\u2019s CIT is both a privilege and a calling. In his own words:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to give back to those who are less fortunate, especially in the wider community. Being part of the Community Impact Team is a great way to be directly involved in making a difference.\u201d\n\nDriven by a passion for helping underserved communities, he sees the team as a hands-on way to make a meaningful difference beyond the workplace. Last year, Scott spoke at a Tech for Good event by Engineering Good in Singapore, where he connected with advocates and innovators. Inspired by this experience, he began working on an assistive tech project, creating a working prototype app that leverages the Adobe Firefly Services API to allow those with limited motor skills to create art through basic touch and enabling people with disabilities to express themselves creatively. Through Adobe initiatives like the Employee Community Fund (ECF), he has been a part of tangible impact Adobe has on local nonprofits.\n\n\u201cECF is amazing because it is a direct way Adobe can impact local nonprofit organizations,\u201d he notes. \u201cNot only from a financial perspective, but it has opened up dialogue between Adobe employees and the grantees to see how we can further collaborate.\u201d\n\nAdobe continues to be committed to doing the right thing by focusing on people, purpose, and community and dedicated employees like Scott help us maximize our reach for good, ensuring everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make a difference.",

The median overall survival (OS) was not reached (95% CI, 19.7 months-not evaluable [NE]).\n\nPatients harboring central nervous system (CNS) lesions (n = 99) experienced a CNS best-ORR of 65.9% and a median PFS of 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.6-NE).1,2\n\nThe safety profile of limertinib was consistent with that of other EGFR-targeted therapies.1\n\n\u201cLimertinib has demonstrated significant efficacy and safety in [patients with] NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutations and EGFR-sensitive mutations. Patients treated with limertinib showed a reduced risk of CNS progression or death. This approval brings new hope and options to patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC in China,\u201d Shi Yuankai, MD, a professor in the Department of Medical Oncology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and principal investigator of the phase 2b study, stated in a news release.\n\nThe single-arm, open-label phase 2b study enrolled patients 18 to 70 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent NSCLC harboring an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity.3 Patients needed to have radiological documentation of disease progression following previous continuous treatment with an EGFR TKI and documented evidence of an EGFR T790M mutation after disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen.\n\nOther key inclusion criteria consisted of an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had received a prior third-generation EGFR TKI; received any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agent, or other anticancer drug within 14 days of first study treatment; or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.\n\nDuring the phase 2b portion of the study, all patients received limertinib at 160 mg twice per day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.2\n\nIRC-assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria served as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points included DCR, PFS, DOR, OS, and safety.\n\nAdditional safety data showed that 96.0% of patients experienced at least 1 treatment-related adverse effect (TRAE). The most TRAEs included diarrhea (81.7%), anemia (32.6%), rash (29.9%), and anorexia (28.2%). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs were reported in 34.6% of patients, and the most common comprised diarrhea (13.0%), hypokalemia (4.3%), anemia (4.0%), and rash (3.3%). TRAEs led to dose interruption and dose discontinuation in 24.6% and 2% of patients, respectively. No TRAEs led to death.\n\nAnother new drug application seeking the approval of limertinib for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations is currently under review by the NMPA.1,4 This application was supported by data from a phase 3 trial (NCT04143607) evaluating limertinib vs gefitinib (Iressa); this study met its PFS primary end point.\n\n\u201cThe approval of limertinib\u2019s first indication marks a significant milestone, providing new treatment options for [patients with EGFR] T790 mutation\u2013positive lung cancer who have progressed after previous EGFR TKI treatments,\u201d Hui Zhou, PhD, senior vice president of Innovent Biologics, added in a news release.1 \u201cWe anticipate the first-line treatment indication will benefit even more patients in the near future. As our 14th commercial product, limertinib represents an important advancement in precision medicine for lung cancer. We look forward to working with ASK Pharm to bring limertinib to market and benefit Chinese patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\u201d\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Adobe's 'base' Photography plan increases by nearly $200 a year\n\nBy Tim Levy and Mike O'Connor | 17 January 2025\n\nAdobe has announced major changes to the subscription models for its popular Photography Plan that includes editing software Photoshop and Lightroom.\n\nFrom today, new signups to the package will face significant price increases, however existing users will escape the price jump, with one caveat \u2013 they must shift to an annual, one-off payment to retain their previous rate.\n\nThis means that Adobe has dropped the \u2018base\u2019 Photography Plan that previously cost $171.84 AUD per year with 20GB of online storage.\n\nNow, new users will pay $371.84 per year, or $30.99 a month, although it now includes 1TB of online storage. The previous 1TB plan was $343.07 per year.\n\nOn a monthly basis, if an existing user continues with their 20GB plan, the plan will increase from $14.29 ($171.47 a year) to $23.99 per month ($287.88 a year), however this can be avoided by switching to an annual plan, prepaid, which should remain at $171.47 per year.\n\nIf you are currently on a monthly 20GB plan, look out for an email from Adobe warning of the upcoming changes to your plan.\n\nThis means that the previous cheapest way into the Photographer's package was $14.29 a month ($171.47). It will now be $30.99 a month ($371.84), an increase of nearly $200.\n\nOn the Adobe FAQ page for the Creative Cloud Photography (20GB) pricing changes the company says \u201cThe Creative Cloud Photography plan (20GB) will be discontinued as of January 15, 2025, and will no longer be available to new subscribers.\n\nAdobe will, however, continue to honour existing subscriptions until users decide to cancel.\u201d\n\nUnder the heading of What is the price change for the Creative Cloud Photography plan (20GB)? it says \u2018Annual prepaid: No increase, the price will remain A$171.47 per year\u2019.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, on checking my personal Adobe 20GB Photography Plan subscription profile page (which I've had since 2014), it currently says that my next payment due in May 2025 will be for $191.93 \u2013 an increase of roughly $20.\n\nIt's not a huge, or even undue increase, but there is some mixed messaging there. We've reached out to Adobe for an explanation for this.\n\nScreengrab of current Adobe's 20GB Photography Plan. Image: Tim Levy\n\nAt the same time, the Creative Cloud Annual Prepaid package, which includes the entire suite of Creative Cloud products, has also seen an increase.\n\nFor new users it has increased from $871.07 to $1,163.88 per year (with 100GB of online storage), although it's currently discounted at 50% off for 3 months, making it $1,018.38. For current subscribers, the price will increase to $959.90 per year.\n\nIn a statement on its website, Adobe says the price increases to its Photographer\u2019s Package are the result of the increasing value that\u2019s been added since its launch over a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\"Since its launch over a decade ago, the Photography plan (20GB) has maintained its competitive pricing, all the while expanding to include highly sought-after apps like Lightroom for mobile, Photoshop for iPad and the web, among others.\" says the statement.\n\n\"Recent additions to your membership include tools and capabilities like Select Subject, Remove Background, and the Contextual Task Bar in Photoshop and Lens Blur, Denoise, and hundreds of Premium Presets in Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are committed to supporting photographers and continuing to innovate across our platform, including Lightroom Classic.\"\n\nAt the same time, Adobe has also invested heavily in AI technology through its Firefly software, which is sold as a standalone product for $7.95 a month with 100 monthly generative credits used for creating AI generated work.\n\nThe new 1TB Photographer's Package includes Firefly and also comes with 500 generative credits. On the original 20GB plan, users only received 250 credits. As an example, a single use of the Generative Fill action in Photoshop uses one credit.\n\nHowever, to further soften the blow of the increases, Adobe is running a temporary discount on the Lightroom Photoshop plan.\n\nFrom now until February 26, the 1TB plan is 25% off for the first six months, making the cost $23.23 a month for the first six months of the 12-month contract.\n\nLightroom Classic in Library module. Image: Mike O'Connor\n\nSo, who needs 1TB of cloud storage?\n\nUltimately the value in the package and whether users can stomach the increases comes down to how much benefit you\u2019ll get from the additional storage that comes from the 1TB offering.\n\n'Adobe Lightroom' (the mobile, online, and app version) has been a significant success for Adobe, and has reeled in a new generation of younger users and content creators who rely on cloud storage to access their images across devices or remotely through any browser.\n\nMany professional 'legacy' users, or as Adobe refers to them, 'power users,' prefer Lightroom Classic. While it does offers cloud storage, Classic is primarily designed for the bulk processing of images \u2013 which can be anywhere from tens, to hundreds or even thousands of images.\n\nUploading thousands of images from a single shoot to the cloud is impractical, making the value of 1TB of cloud storage less apparent.\n\n\n\nIs the Photography Plan 1TB still good value?\n\nTime is one of our most valuable resources, and in the past couple of years, the latest AI updates to Lightroom and Photoshop have significantly reduced the time spent in post-production.\n\nFeatures like Denoise, Background Selection, Detecting (masking) People(s) body parts (such as teeth), and Generative Fill have made the editing process much faster and more efficient. So in this light, it is still reasonable value.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, apart from being able to use Lightroom and Photoshop, the Photographer's Plan also comes with quite a few unheralded extra apps such as: Adobe Fonts, Creative Cloud Libraries, Behance, Adobe Firefly, Bridge (already free), and two very useful web apps \u2013 Adobe Portfolio and Adobe Express.\n\n\n\nAdobe Portfolio allows users to create professional looking, easy-to-build, template-based websites. It is particularly popular among photographers, designers, artists, and other creatives looking to display their projects in an aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-navigate format.\n\nIn fact, just purchasing a WIX basic template website will set you back $192 a year, so we could say that the inclusion of Adobe Portfolio is a good deal for photographers wanting an easy-to-build and maintain personal website.\n\n\n\nAdobe Express (formerly Adobe Spark) is an easy-to-use, all-in-one app designed for creating a wide range of visual content. It simplifies graphic design, video editing, and content creation, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.\n\nAvailable on mobile and desktop, Adobe Express is ideal for creating social media posts, flyers, banners, logos, short videos, complete web pages, and more.\n\nLightroom Alternatives",

            "content": "A law to ban TikTok in the United States by Sunday was upheld by the Supreme Court in a ruling Friday morning that emphasized national security concerns over the app\u2019s collection of US citizens\u2019 data.\n\nThe ruling could set the stage for future regulations regarding the collection of data by foreign-owned companies and furthers the US\u2019 crackdown on technologies from foreign adversary countries like China and Russia.\n\n\u201cIt sets a precedent or upholds the precedent that an organization that has ties to a designated foreign adversary should be banned. I think we could see this used for other organizations if the government actually enforces it, which is in limbo,\u201d said Dustin Sachs, chief technologist and senior director of programs at CyberRisk Alliance.\n\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, which is headquartered in China and subject to Chinese law that requires it to give the Chinese government \u201cpower to access and control private data\u201d held by the company, the ruling notes.\n\nThe app has approximately 170 million users in the United States, and collects data including device information, location, usage information and message contents; it can also access information about a user\u2019s phone and social network contacts with the user\u2019s permission.\n\nIn April, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act , which would effectively ban TikTok and other \u201cforeign adversary controlled\u201d applications and websites in the United States.\n\nOther than TikTok, the law would apply to other apps with more than a million monthly active users that allow users to generate, share and view content, are \u201ccontrolled by a foreign adversary\u201d and are \u201cdetermined by the President to present a significant threat to the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nTikTok can only continue to operate in the United States if ByteDance divests from the application and the president determines it is \u201cno longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\u201d\n\nWhile TikTok has denied sharing US users\u2019 information with the Chinese government, proponents of the law argue the government\u2019s authority over ByteDance could lead to vast amounts of information on US citizens being used for intelligence operations and espionage by the foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok, in its petition asking the Supreme Court to block the law, argued that the law would impede free speech, and that less restrictive alternatives such as disclosure requirements, data sharing restrictions and a proposed national security agreement would be sufficient to address the security concerns.\n\nThe justices disagreed with the First Amendment argument, ruling that law was \u201ccontent neutral,\u201d that the national security concerns addressed by the law were warranted and that the law\u2019s focus on TikTok was justified by the vast extent of data collected by the app.\n\n\u201cIf you peel back all the politics, international negotiations, and social media hype, the TikTok ban came from genuine concerns about privacy and national security. To say that banning one platform will permanently affect free speech seems like a stretch. The fickle social media market will quickly find many alternative ways to share content and amuse themselves,\u201d said Willy Leichter, chief marketing officer at AppSOC, in an email to SC Media. \u201cAssuming this ruling doesn\u2019t get watered down by the Trump administration, it\u2019s an example of pursuing and acting upon serious security issues.\u201d\n\nThe law will require TikTok to be removed from app stores and websites in the United States beginning on January 19, 2025, although President Joe Biden said he does not plan to enforce the law on his last day in office, according to the Associated Press . President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to work out a solution that allows TikTok to remain available in the United States.\n\nSachs noted in previous coverage of the TikTok case for SC Media that the ruling could have implications not only for foreign-owned companies, but also for US companies that work with partners and vendors in other countries.\n\n\u201cCISOs should review technology stacks, conduct thorough vendor risk assessments, and implement strategies to mitigate supply chain risks,\u201d Sachs wrote. \u201cOrganizations interacting with foreign-owned technologies could face heightened scrutiny, compelling CISOs to enhance security controls and incident response plans.\u201d\n\nThe US government has recently been cracking down on the sale of technologies originating from foreign adversary countries, as critical infrastructure attacks and espionage by foreign adversary threat actors like China\u2019s Volt Typhoon and Russia\u2019s APT29 put the nation\u2019s cyber defenders on high alert.\n\nLast June, the US banned the Russia-based security company Kaspersky from selling its products in the country due to alleged ties to the Russian government. And earlier this month, the U.S. Commerce Department issued a final rule that will forbid Chinese and Russian software and hardware from being used in US passenger vehicles by 2027 and 2030, respectively.",

            "content": "Meet Manal Elias, mixed media master and Adobe MAX Creativity Award honoree\n\nTo describe Manal Elias as multitalented is an understatement. The 2024 Adobe MAX Creativity Award honoree for Mixed Media is an accomplished designer, filmmaker, photographer, and digital storyteller, but what truly sets Elias apart is the way she combines these skills to build captivating brand experiences that resonate with audiences on a deeply personal level.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than in the 360-degree campaign Elias developed for VidCon 2024, one of the world's largest conventions for digital brands and content creators. Elias worked with a team of talented designers and agencies to create more than 1,000 assets for the conference using Adobe solutions. Those assets ranged from VidCon\u2019s visual identity to character design, to social media ads, to billboards, to immersive experiences at the Anaheim Convention Center.\n\nMost importantly, Elias helped VidCon create a space where 55,000 people could come together and celebrate their love for digital creativity and self-expression. \u201cIf I were to meet Beyonc\u00e9 in real-life, I would collapse. Each of the influencers on stage at VidCon are as big as Beyonc\u00e9 for their fans, who engage with them every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThat love and passion shaped every aspect of my designs for the 2024 conference.\u201d\n\nBuilding a unique visual language\n\nElias was always drawn to the arts, but her career path as a creative was anything but linear. Born in Dubai years before the city became a cultural hub for the Emirates, her exposure to design came through television and from magazines she would encounter on trips abroad or that her family and friends would bring her from their travels.\n\n\u201cMagazines were my window into the rest of the world. They were like my social media,\u201d Elias says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait for visitors from Beirut and France to bring me a new stack of inspiration to leaf through.\u201d\n\nThe rise of the internet introduced Elias to web design and the work of digital creators from around the world. In addition to learning from these digital pioneers, Elias began to develop her graffiti and lettering skills, filling notebooks with sketches and collages of magazine clippings. \u201cScrapbooking allowed me to express myself in a way that wasn\u2019t traditionally accessible to Arab kids of my generation. It was liberating,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she reached college age, Elias initially wanted to become an interpreter and was accepted by the University of Saint Joseph in Beirut, one of Lebanon\u2019s most reputable schools for political science. But Israel and Hezbollah went to war in 2006, soon after she arrived in the country, forcing Elias and her mother to flee to Syria and destroying her academic plans. The trauma of the experience made Elias reevaluate her priorities, return to Dubai, and pursue her true passion: graphic design.\n\nCreating community through 360-degree experiences\n\nElias dove into her studies, developing skills in graphics, photography, and typography. Thirsty for more, she also got into branding and visual identify, which would become the focus of her early years as a creative professional in Dubai. But it was Elias\u2019s move to Los Angeles to pursue a master\u2019s degree in filmmaking that would lay the groundwork for her career as a master of mixed media storytelling.\n\nEleven years later, Elias has become the go-to designer for one of the most relevant and forward-thinking digital conferences in the world. \u201cVidCon is a Mecca for people who want to make their name in content creation. It\u2019s like Adobe MAX for designers,\u201d she says. \u201cI always knew they would be a dream client, and I am immensely proud of the work we do together.\u201d\n\nOn a technical level, VidCon gave Elias a rare opportunity to develop integrated brand experiences for a uniquely receptive audience. From digital advertisements to merchandise and swag, to interactive experiences at VidCon itself, Elias\u2019s output for the conference saw her apply every tool in her creative toolbox to engage with its digitally savvy fanbase.\n\nAbove all, Elias loved the sense of community VidCon creates for its fans. The conference is a beacon of self-expression for digital creators and a safe space for the countless LGBTQ2+ individuals they inspire each day.\n\n\u201cI never could have imagined being in a hall with hundreds of LGBTQ2+ kids waving flags that represent them and supporting creators who give them hope. It feels like a full-circle moment to be part of that experience.\u201d -Manal Elias, creative director\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C-EvugSxW2h/ Bringing the love and passion to VidCon 2024. Source: Manal Elias.\n\nVidCon 2024 was also a must-attend event in the gaming world, with the 15-year anniversary of Minecraft, widely regarded as one of the best video games of the 21st century and one of the most-watched games in YouTube history. YouTube honored its beloved Minecraft community with a special booth at VidCon, and the celebration helped inspire Elias\u2019s designs for the conference.\n\nCombining the power of Adobe After Effects, Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Frame.io, Elias and her team gave the VidCon brand a refresh and a new 3D shape library inspired by the inclusivity, child-like fun, and wonder that the creator and gaming communities bring to VidCon.\n\n3D design features in Illustrator proved invaluable in this regard, allowing Elias to imagine playful new ways to connect with VidCon attendees. For instance, she created balloon-effect typography and icons for VidCon by preparing the necessary vectors in Illustrator and extruding them using the application\u2019s Inflate tool.\n\n\u201cAdobe Illustrator makes it easy to create 3D assets, even if you only have a background in 2D design. It\u2019s a great capability that literally adds a new dimension to my storytelling,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cross-functionality of Adobe apps allows me to move between assets and tasks while staying in one design environment, and with Adobe Firefly that even includes image generation. Best of all, the technologies get better each day.\u201d -Manal Elias, creative director\n\nElias is now exploring Adobe Firefly, models and services that power generative AI capabilities in Adobe creative apps and looks forward to experimenting with features like Structure Reference and Style Reference on future projects. The ability to use an existing image as a structure and style reference template for generating new images while ensuring safe commercial use is a major selling point for Elias, who believes all artists can benefit from the responsible use of emerging creative solutions.\n\n\u201cEvery designer should keep up with the latest technologies, even if they don\u2019t necessarily use them,\u201d she says. \u201cLearning and experimentation are the best ways to keep growing and developing new skills, which helps you gain self-assurance and earn the confidence of clients that excite you.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Manal Elias, her collaboration with VidCon, and her other work on Instagram or visit her website.\n\nFor the full list of 2024 Adobe MAX Creativity Awards honorees and their projects click here.",

Scheduled tasks is rolling out in beta for users of ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Teams. Enterprise users will get access soon; free users will also eventually get it. OpenAI did not give out specific dates.\n\nWith tasks, you can tell ChatGPT to do things like summarize the week\u2019s top national news at 5 p.m. on Fridays, or set up a daily 15-minute workout that focuses on lifting weights. It also can give you recurring reminders, like take out the trash on Sundays at 6 p.m. ET. But make sure you turn on notifications under settings. Users can edit or cancel the task.\n\nScheduled Tasks is available on the ChatGPT website, iOS, Android and macOS. Integration into the Windows app is coming in the first quarter. For now, the list of tasks you create is only visible on the ChatGPT website. Tasks use OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model; users are limited to 10 tasks at a time. In addition, each plan\u2019s messaging limits also apply; Plus members can send up to 80 messages every three hours on GPT-4o, for example.\n\nStability AI, Nvidia Unveil 2D-to-3D AI Model\n\nStability AI, one of the co-developers of image generation model Stable Diffusion, and Nvidia announced SPAR3D, which can turn a 2D image into an editable 3D object in less than a second. This model can transform 3D prototyping for game developers, product designers and metaverse builders.\n\nResearchers used a two-stage method for the model: the point sampling stage and the meshing stage. The first stage uses diffusion models to generate sparse point clouds, while the second stage transforms these point clouds into highly detailed meshes. That means an uploaded 2D image of an object is changed into little points that follow the shape of the object. Then, it is overlaid with a generated mesh to make it into a 3D object. What\u2019s unique about this process is that users can edit the image.\n\nAdobe\u2019s New AI Editing Tool\n\nAdobe introduced a new generative AI tool that can edit large batches of images with one click, according to The Verge. Called Firefly Bulk Create, the app lets users quickly resize up to 10,000 images \u2014 or do things like replace the background of images en masse. This helps creative teams apply a similar look to digital assets to maintain brand consistency. The tool is available to customers of the Firefly premium services.\n\nMicrosoft Challenges OpenAI\u2019s o1 in Math\n\nMicrosoft researchers introduced rStar-Math, a reasoning method that, when applied to small language models, can match or even surpass the math reasoning capabilities of bigger and more powerful models like OpenAI\u2019s o1, without having to copy knowledge from these larger models.\n\nIn a paper, researchers said rStar-Math was able to achieve this performance by exercising \u201cdeep thinking\u201d through Monte Carlo Tree Search, where an algorithm builds a \u201ctree\u201d of possible moves and outcomes, simulates plays to see which ones lead to good results, and learns from it.\n\nFor businesses, it means they can rely on smaller, more cost-effective AI models to solve complex problems, such as optimizing logistics and predicting financial outcomes. Companies can lower what they spend on AI compute while achieving similar or better results from smaller models. Since rStar-Math can also generate high-quality training data, businesses can use it to develop AI tools to tackle specific tasks like detecting financial fraud.",

            "content": "Spread the love\n\nThere are obvious questions about the Content Authenticity Initiative by Adobe that still are being worked out. However, we have a lot of hope that it\u2019s going to help the future of the web. One of the biggest problems the web currently faces is misinformation with generative AI imagery. So camera manufacturers have been working to prevent this from being a problem by integrating Content Credentials into their images. Leica does this with many cameras, including the SL3s announced today. But Nikon, Sony, Canon, and Fujifilm have also signed up to be onboard. And there\u2019s even more too. Information from Adobe\u2019s press communications are below.\n\nThough the bigger camera manufacturers are working with Adobe on implementing CAI into their cameras, they\u2019re still only seemingly doing it via firmware and not through a dedicated chipset the way that Leica does. And further, we\u2019ve still got concerns about how we can authenticate any image on the web to ensure that it wasn\u2019t made by Generative AI. FStoppers and MPB famously used generative AI for an ad a while back. Nikon also previously used Unsplash for an anti-AI campaign \u2014 yet Unsplash has been a major contributor to the efforts of Generative AI platforms. Squarespace also automatically allowed photographers to opt into having their website contents scraped by AI according to Petapixel.\n\nThe truth is that big companies will do anything to get to their goals. But with a few big brands signing on such as Microsoft, things might become much better regulated \u2014 unlike the Fediverse. So hopefully, efforts by CAI might change that.\n\nThe following are press communications made by Adobe to the Phoblographer.\n\nAs a disclaimer, the Phoblographer is a member of Adobe\u2019s Content Authenticity Initiative. In fact, we\u2019re the only North American photography publication that is. So too is TIPA, an alliance of publishers that we\u2019re part of.\n\n\u201cLeica\u2019s newest SL-System camera with built in Content Credentials is a significant milestone for the CAI, the global Content Credentials standard, and the future of photojournalism, helping to bring our principles of trust and provenance into customer-ready technology. We are grateful for Leica\u2019s partnership and committed to empowering photographers everywhere to attach Content Credentials to their photos and videos from the moment they capture them. To build a more transparent digital ecosystem, we need Content Credentials everywhere, and this marks an important step in making that vision a reality.\u201d Andy Parsons, Senior Director, Content Authenticity Initiative at Adobe\n\nAdditional Details about Content Authenticity Initiative and Content Credentials:\n\nContent Credentials are akin to a \u201cnutrition label\u201d for digital content that anyone can attach to their work to share information about themselves and provide context about how their content was created and edited.\n\nthat anyone can attach to their work to share information about themselves and provide context about how their content was created and edited.

To that end, the program places artists at some of the world\u2019s most famous art institutions and gives them a chance to showcase their work.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Creative Resident alumni list is extremely impressive, featuring well-known photographers like Aundre Larrow, Christina Poku, Amelie Satzger, Aaron Bernstein, who goes by Hungry Boy, and many more.\n\nThis year\u2019s photography resident, Michael Akuagwu, blends photography, photo manipulation, and a surreal creative spirit to \u201cexplore themes of self, identity, culture, and society.\u201d Self-portraiture is a significant part of his portfolio and has played a central role throughout his series, including Jungle Justice in 2023, Michael\u2019s Toolkit in 2022, and 2021\u2019s Church Hurts.\n\n\u201cThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, so I often think about how much more can be communicated through photo-composites, blending multiple images into a single, unified story,\u201d Akuagwu says.\n\nThe new 2025 Adobe Creative Residents group includes multidisciplinary artist Samora Pinderhughes, designer Jessica Starns, and mosaics and ceramic artist Ciara Neufeldt. Akuagwu, Starns, and Neufeldt will be residents at The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London, while Pinderhughes is being welcomed to the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA).\n\nAkuagwu says he is particularly excited to engage with the V&A Collections, including photographs of the Black British Experience from the 1950s through the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t many (if any) black artists on my school curriculum, I didn\u2019t really explore the arts further until after university and I often feel like I\u2019m playing catch up, so I\u2019m excited to learn more about Black photographers in the collections, their works and practices,\u201d the photographer explains.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome our new cohort of Residents and eagerly await the many ways in which our collaborations will unfold in 2025, from sharing their making processes in photography, mosaics and ceramic tilework and inclusive design with our audiences, to enlivening wider debates on creativity, socially engaged practice using collections and access to creative careers,\u201d says Dr. Helen Charman, director of learning at V&A.\n\nThe Adobe Creative Residency program works alongside world-class art institutions like the MoMA, V&A, the Museum of Art and Photography in Bangalore, the National Museum of Art Japan, and The Museum of Image and Sound Sao Polo (MIS). The work of the 2024 residents is on display at MoMA and V&A.\n\n\u201cThrough the Adobe Creativity Residency program, we are building new pathways to bridge the gap between established art institutions and the next generation of creators,\u201d says Stacy Martinet, Adobe VP of Marketing Strategy and Communications and Adobe Foundation Board member.\n\n\u201cThe Adobe Foundation is honored to be investing in this first of its kind collaboration, supporting creators to present their artistic visions in ways never before possible and making creativity more accessible to all.\u201d\n\nAdobe aspires to reach 10 million young creators through its global Creative Residents program by 2028.\n\nImage credits: Adobe",

Mulveny is a long-time champion of Carolina\u2019s global mission and contributor to the Chancellor\u2019s Global Education Fund.\n\nDuring her visit, Mulveny compared differences in AI policymaking among countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America and discussed concerns about deepfakes, misinformation and intellectual property rights.\n\n\u201cOur heritage is so strongly embedded in protecting creatives,\u201d Mulveny said, \u201cthat when we developed Firefly, we decided to only train on content where we hold a license, that is in the public domain or that has a copyright that has expired.\u201d\n\nThis example shows how Adobe\u2019s approach to AI is different, she said. Adobe formed the Content Authenticity Initiative, a coalition currently with more than 3,000 companies, such as Canon, the Associated Press, Nvidia and Getty Images, reflecting the broad and overlapping impact of AI.\n\n\u201cJennifer did a brilliant job explaining the significance of provenance, which she described as nutrition labels for images,\u201d said Barbara Stephenson, vice provost for global affairs and chief global officer. \u201cShe modeled for the rising generation, including those active in the Diplomacy Initiative, how Carolina prepares students to tackle the grand challenges of our time.\u201d\n\nThe data science school dean said he was thrilled to hear Mulveny\u2019s perspective on the current landscape of AI for creatives, particularly the efforts around content provenance and authenticity.\n\n\u201cOur students are using these tools already, and they are preparing to enter a workforce quickly being shaped by AI,\u201d Stan Ahalt said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for our students to understand the implications of using these tools and more about the companies who are committed to using this technology responsibly.\u201d\n\nA global path to tech\n\nAfter meeting with faculty and administrators, Mulveny visited assistant professor Neil Gaikwad\u2019s DATA 120 course, Ethics of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. She encouraged students to expand their horizons as they imagine their future careers. That\u2019s how she made a career in the tech industry and a life in Australia.\n\nGrowing up in Delaware, Mulveny never considered life beyond the U.S. At Carolina, she studied English, wrote for The Daily Tar Heel, worked in Davis Library and was a student leader in Habitat for Humanity.\n\nShe once enrolled in a political science class \u201cout of a natural curiosity\u201d and became a double-major, which led her to an internship in Washington, D.C. She earned her master\u2019s degree in international relations from George Washington University. After several years working in government and the private sector, she accepted a two-year stint in Australia that turned into an unexpected career path and a new home for her family.\n\nMulveny sees the challenges of AI\u2019s impact on young people every day in her own home. She said her sons are comfortable seeing \u2014 and are seemingly unfazed by \u2014 AI-generated content.\n\n\u201cWe need a lot of education for digital media literacy, not just for students but for the public generally. Me included!\u201d Mulveny said. \u201cPeople need the right tools to look at a piece of content with a critical eye before they take it as truth and share it. We are not there yet, but Adobe is doing a lot of groundbreaking work in this space.\u201d\n\nRead more about Jennifer Mulveny, a Carolina Global Heel.",

Los Angeles is a global hub of creativity, shaping culture and redefining industries. It\u2019s home to countless artists, filmmakers, designers and innovators \u2014 too many of whom have lost their homes, studios and equipment.\n\nIn response to the immediate need of those affected by the wildfires, and those in the creative community, the Adobe Foundation is donating $1 million across the California Community Foundation: Wildfire Recovery Fund and the Entertainment Community Fund. If you are also looking for ways to support, we will match your donations to these incredible organizations at 100%:\n\nCalifornia Community Foundation: Wildfire Recovery Fund: This leading nonprofit is dedicated to offering disaster and recovery support through directed grants. Their efforts encompass a wide range of critical recovery services, including housing, case management, mental health, and medical care for displaced residents. Additionally, the fund aids in rebuilding essential infrastructure, such as emergency communication systems, ensuring that the community can recover and rebuild effectively.\n\nEntertainment Community Fund: This fund is committed to fostering stability and resiliency within the performing arts and entertainment industry. It provides a safety net for professionals both on and off camera, offering direct aid to those who have suffered losses due to the fires. By supporting creators and workers in the entertainment industry, the fund helps maintain the vibrancy and creativity for which Los Angeles is known.\n\nOther organizations that we are supporting include the American Red Cross and Direct Relief. Both have been on the ground providing urgent and much-needed aid to the LA community.\n\n\n\nIf you need support\n\nIf you have been impacted by this disaster and need urgent individual support, our partner, the California Community Foundation, has provided a list of resources for impacted individuals.\n\nFinally, thank you to everyone on the ground providing support and relief.",

Exane sees an improved risk/reward and thinks the shares may find near-term support with management seeking to address near-term concerns.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Digital Realty (DLR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $194, up from $185. The firm says momentum remains at the company's back, with \"robust\" demand along with space and power constraints that are unlikely to moderate any time soon.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded CBRE Group (CBRE) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $160, up from $115. As the largest commercial real estate services and investment firm in the world with a market leading position in both resilient recurring business lines and higher margin cyclical business lines, the company is best positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth among the group, argues the analyst, who makes CBRE \"Top Pick\" among REITs.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Healthpeak Properties (DOC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $25 price target. While the firm shares market concerns about elevated lab supply and potential financial pressure on biotech tenants in Healthpeak's key markets of San Francisco, Boston and San Diego, it also notes their highly occupied and higher quality assets, combined with deep tenant relations, has led them to outperform investor leasing expectation in 2024 and argues this may continue in 2025.",

This sort of initiative is always popular in whatever software it appears as it accelerates content creation, streamlines communication, improves creativity by letting you bounce ides off colleagues, and also eliminates the amount of errors and misunderstandings that can bedevil a project.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s not an entirely new feature. Sharing and collaboration have been a part of Photoshop for a while now, but was limited to one user at a time. Simultaneous working is a whole new ballpark when it comes to collaboration and, according to Adobe, will mean that:\n\nMultiple designers can simultaneously work on a Photoshop document, splitting tasks to tackle and complete projects more efficiently, together.\n\nCreative teams at large enterprises can collaborate on highly matrixed projects, solicit stakeholder input and address feedback all in a single file.\n\nCreators can collect client feedback more intuitively by inviting them to directly collaborate on a file, view edits and make comments.\n\nStudents can follow along live as educators demonstrate workflows and teach techniques in Photoshop. Comments and edits can be made directly in a student\u2019s document by teachers to help enhance learning and contextualize feedback.\n\nPhotoshop users can sign up for what has now become a waitlist here, with the initial batch of invites expected to roll out next week. And, as Adobe is quick to point out, it joins a long list of new features that debuted in 2024 from Distraction Removal to an improved font browser and any number of AI tools.\n\nNo word yet on when it will appear in the general release, but the speed with which iterations tend to get added to the software line up by the Adobe devs at the moment suggests not long.\n\ntl;dr",

Digital twins also enable teams to more easily experiment with new concepts while obtaining consumer feedback.\n\nMcKinsey has reported that the global market for digital-twin technology will reach $73.5 billion by 2027.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nAccording to information from Tapestry and Adobe, the fashion company is now leveraging generative AI through Adobe Firefly, which the tech giant described as a \u201ccommercially safe family of creative generative AI models.\u201d\n\nTapestry \u201ctrained\u201d Adobe Firefly to ingest different \u201cCoach codes,\u201d which are design components such as the hang tag or nuances around materials and hardware. This means that when text prompts are used to generate a new digital twin, the image will match the brand\u2019s identity, eliminating potential trademark issues.\n\nTapestry has been utilizing Adobe Firefly since around late 2024, but the firms waited to publicly disclose the initiative until they felt comfortable the collaboration was effective.\n\n\u201cThe team had a breakthrough moment where an initial test of their Firefly Custom Model produced tailored digital twins that accurately mirrored products already seen on store shelves,\u201d Adobe said in a statement. \u201cIt was a big unlock that allows Tapestry to scale a critical internal service \u2014 allowing teams to better ideate and deliver products that resonate.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Camara, Tapestry\u2019s senior director of digital product creation, said: \u201cWe understood the potential for generative AI to alleviate the bottlenecks that were preventing us from scaling our digital twins, but we needed a trusted partner that was reliable and ethical in their approach to the technology. We have a long relationship with Adobe, and our teams love their design tools. We felt confident in what Adobe Firefly could generate, and the result from our customized model will dramatically change how we support our brands from concept to consumer.\u201d\n\nAsked if any products created with the help of digital twins have been available to shoppers so far, Camara replied through an email: \u201cYes. Our Tapestry digital product creation team has been developing digital twins to create, make and sell our products. This is true across our brands \u2014 Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman \u2014 and product categories. Today, we use 3D modeling software and Adobe Substance to create and visualize our digital twins. Over the last two years, the need for these assets has dramatically increased, prompting us to seek out new innovative tools like Adobe Firefly Custom Models & AI Services, to meet this need.\u201d\n\nAsked about the impact of digital twinning, Camara said: \u201cDigital twins are used in product development to create and make our products. But they are also leveraged across Tapestry for selling. Because these digital twins are so accurate they are used for customer experience, strategy and e-commerce.\u201d\n\nCamara pointed to in-store experiences, gaming, focus groups, social media, digital selling and customization, adding that, \u201cIt has been challenging to satisfy all of these use cases across our house of brands and product categories, which is why we are excited for Firefly to help us scale.\u201d\n\nAside from digital twins being used by Tapestry\u2019s design teams and consumer focus groups, the company\u2019s strategy and global visual experience teams use digital twins to scale content for social media campaigns and in-store merchandising. But Camara sees Adobe Firefly having \u201ca big influence\u201d on design for spring 2026.\n\nTapestry is charged by Adobe Firefly based on the number of custom models that are trained.\n\nAsked what other brands use Adobe for digital twins, an Adobe representative said via email: \u201cTapestry is the first Generative AI-powered digital twin example we are sharing publicly. In the past, we have shared how brands like Hugo Boss, Burberry and Salomon have used non-Gen AI Adobe tools [Adobe Substance 3D] to create digital twins, which works great for them. Every brand has different needs, and Tapestry is showing a different approach with Gen AI.\u201d",

Sign up using the registration screener so you can test drive this new technology and influence how it evolves.\n\nBe sure to check out the most popular recent community-driven innovations in Photoshop.\n\nPopular community-driven innovations\n\nPhotoshop launched dozens of innovative features and capabilities in 2024 that improved adjustments, compositing, selecting and typography workflows, all informed by community feedback. Try out these popular capabilities if you haven\u2019t already by updating your Photoshop app to the latest version.\n\nRemove Tool with Distraction Removal\n\nThe Distraction Removal capability in the Remove Tool automatically detects and removes wires and people from the background and replaces them with generated content while preserving image integrity, depth, and complex details. You can remove multiple unwanted elements from a photo, like tourists in the background of your travel photos or pesky power lines disrupting your beautiful landscape image, which significantly simplifies your workflows and saves effort on tedious editing tasks.\n\nCheck out real world examples from Photoshop Influencer Partners:\n\n@Marinawphoto perfects her portrait photography in busy and public places.\n\n@mylesesmind declutters her scenes so she can focus on her creativity.\n\nImproved Font browser\n\nFor projects focused on typography, use the improved Font browser to search, filter, live preview, and use 25,000+ free and licensed fonts from the cloud without leaving the Photoshop app. Search fonts by name, explore different dialects, and find the perfect typeface for any aesthetic without interrupting your workflows. Once a new font is added from the cloud, it will automatically sync across all your Photoshop devices and Adobe Creative Cloud desktop apps for a continuous editing experience.\n\nSee this capability come to life on Instagram, and how Photoshop partner Emma Orhun uses it as a source of design inspiration!\n\nSelection Brush\n\nThe Selection Brush enables you to easily and more intuitively select and adjust specific areas of an image. With a brush, you can change the settings for opacity and hardness and create selections with varying transparency, feathered edges, and more realistic and nuanced effects. The Selection Brush provides more control, flexibility, and intuitiveness whether you are selecting, compositing, adjusting, and generating content.\n\nCheck out this example on Instagram, as well as others made by @iamprestonluke and @onadventurewithdad to composite elements together more seamlessly.\n\n4. Generative AI with the latest Adobe Firefly Image Model\n\nGenerative Fill, Generative Expand, and Generate Similar are now powered by the latest Adobe Firefly Image Model, which yields greatly improved photographic quality, better prompt comprehension to understand complex descriptions, and generation variety to explore different results.\n\n5. Adjustment Brush Tool\n\nWith the Adjustment Brush Tool, you can now paint on adjustments to brightness, saturation, exposure, and more when you want to change a specific part of your image.\n\n6. Custom Adjustment Presets\n\nUse over 30 Adjustment Presets to change images in one click. Create and save custom presets, export them to share, and import new favorites.\n\n7.

            "content": "By Dynamique Twizere '27\n\nAs a student working in the Academic Technology\u2019s PEPS department (Presentation, Events, and Production Support), I\u2019ve had the chance to explore some fascinating projects involving artificial intelligence (AI), from generating images of fictional characters with Midjourney to creating AI-generated voices with ElevenLabs (Shoutout to my supervisor, Dann Hurlbert!). Recently, however, I had one of my most fun and challenging experiences yet. This proof of concept will not be the final product but shows the steps to consider.\n\nA professor shared an AI-generated image of a classical, fairy-tale-style fox sitting on a stool, holding a feather and a book. Along with the image, he also provided a script, which Dann translated into an AI-generated audio file using ElevenLabs. The task at hand? To bring this 2D AI-generated image to life by animating the fox\u2019s mouth and creating natural movements that would make it look like the character was delivering the script.\n\nI started by exploring several AI animation tools like Runway, D-ID and HeyGen, but none offered the level of control I needed. We reached out to those AI companies, and each admitted that they don\u2019t yet create avatars from artistically characters. Eventually, I turned to Adobe Character Animator, a standout app when it comes to animating 2D characters\u2014but, there is a catch: the characters to be animated have to be \u201crigged\u201d.\n\nRigging a character involves breaking down the image into components (e.g., eyes, mouth, arms) and labeling them so the program knows how to animate each. Character Animator, like many animation tools, conveniently has built-in characters ready to be animated. However, because I was working with an external image, I had to rig the character myself. Using Adobe Photoshop, I dissected the original AI image into parts and labeled each for specific animations: the eyes (for blinking), the mouth (for lip-syncing), the arms (for movement), etc. Once rigged, I imported it into Character Animator.\n\nNormally, animating forward-facing rigged characters is straightforward: the app automatically links the body parts of the character to the mirrored body parts of the person in front of the computer\u2019s built-in camera. Not in this case, though. The fox in the image sat in profile, making it difficult for the app to automatically map body movements onto the the fox\u2019s body.\n\nThis offered another creative challenge: figuring out how to add fixed \u201canchor\u201d points and bendable joints that would help clarify for the app what parts should move, bend, or not budge. After the rigging, the fox was ready for animation.\n\nBy either speaking, or playing an audio file on the computer, the fox\u2019s mouth moved in sync, and I could animate its movements in real time\u2014blinking, gesturing, or turning its head. Watching the lifeless AI-generate cartoon come to life as a speaking, expressive character felt magical!\n\nBelow is what this \u201cClassic Fox\u201d looked and sounded like using Adobe Character Animator for the avatar, with the voice developed by ElevenLabs.\n\nAfter this proof of concept, we generated another \u201cClassic Fox,\u201d with a wood block print styled character.\n\nReflecting on moments like these, I\u2019m continually amazed at how many powerful tools out there can seemingly do anything one can imagine. The ongoing rapid improvements in AI make it easier and easier and more and more accessible to realize our imagination, and I am all here for it!\n\n",

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nAs 2025 began, King Lip, chief strategist and partner at BakerAvenue Wealth Management expressed his bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025 during a CNBC interview. He underscored a strong belief in the continued outperformance of tech stocks in 2025, driven by robust earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from our article on the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term that covered this:\n\n\u201c\u2026Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the high valuations of many tech stocks, he argued that they remain within acceptable historical norms. On January 9, Mark Avallone, president at Potomac Wealth Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to discuss why technology is the best sector to invest in right now. He asserts that above-target inflation will prevent the Fed from implementing further easing measures, countering the notion that higher rates are detrimental. He noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\n\nAvallone highlighted recent deal chatter in the tech sector, including Shutter Stock\u2019s potential acquisition in the uniform space, reflecting growing interest in technology-driven solutions. He is optimistic about the incoming administration\u2019s impact on economic efficiencies and stock performance, particularly for large-cap tech firms and mid-cap companies focused on innovation. He views Hilton favorably for its technological advancements in office management and cost efficiency. In the defense sector, he expressed confidence in Boeing\u2019s growth potential, emphasizing that significant cuts to defense spending are unlikely and that advancements in tech will enhance military capabilities.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Adobe is launching new generative AI tools that can automate labor-intensive production tasks like editing large batches of images and translating video presentations. The most notable is \u201cFirefly Bulk Create,\u201d an app that allows users to quickly resize up to 10,000 images or replace all of their backgrounds in a single click instead of tediously editing each picture individually.\n\nThe tool was created by combining several of Adobe\u2019s Firefly-powered APIs for developers, with the aim of making them more accessible to creatives who lack technical coding experience. Bulk Create is launching in beta today, and split into two separate tools on Adobe\u2019s Firefly web app: \u201cRemove Background\u201d and \u201cResize.\u201d The first is pretty self-explanatory \u2014 users can upload image files into the tool from their computer, Dropbox, or Adobe Experience Manager, and quickly remove the backgrounds.\n\nIt should work on any image, but looks especially useful for product marketers. Alongside just removing the background, users can also set the tool to replace backgrounds with a specific image or color (defined by HEX codes) to get variations of each image that are ready for further editing. The file batches can be saved as either PNG or JPEG for now, with Adobe saying that support for Photoshop PSD files will be added in the future.\n\nThe background expansion for \u201cResize\u201d might work fine for abstract images like this, but the tool seems to struggle with photographs. Image: Adobe\n\nThe \u201cResize\u201d tool presents a selection of preset options for popular ad banner sizes and platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. It uses generative AI to stretch the backgrounds of images to fit these required dimensions, but the demo I saw wasn\u2019t particularly inspiring \u2014 there was a lot of obvious warping, with one example strangely copying and blurring wine glasses together that were in the foreground. This could improve when the tool is out of beta, but for now, it may manage simple backgrounds well enough to spare graphic designers from having to manually resize their marketing assets for each platform. While services like Canva and Adobe Express also have tools that make this easier, Bulk Create can do so in a single click.\n\nAdobe is making some new developer APIs for Firefly Services generally available in the coming weeks that developers can use to speed up video and print production workflows. \u201cDubbing and Lip Sync\u201d can translate and edit lip movement for video audio into 14 different languages, and a new InDesign tool can automatically format text and images for print and digital media using predefined templates. \u201cDigital avatars\u201d created using text descriptions and voice recordings will also be available in beta this month, which can be used to present videos and product explainers.\n\nThe power required to edit batches of 10,000 images is presumably expensive. Adobe says there will be a fee to use these new tools based on \u201cconsumption\u201d \u2014 which likely means users will need to pay for a premium Adobe Firefly plan that provides generative credits that can then be \u201cspent\u201d on the features.",

            "content": "Photo editing was never like this before. These days, most photo editing tools or apps have some sort of AI features built into them to help creative professionals with their tasks. Speaking of creatives, Adobe has launched new generative AI (GenAI) tools that can help professionals with bulk image edits and translating video presentations with just one click.\n\nAdobe\u2019s new AI tool can bulk edit as many as 10,000 images with just one click\n\nThe new Bulk Create feature is available in beta on the Adobe Firefly web app starting today. It has two separate tools for resizing assets and replacing backgrounds. As one can guess, the background removal tool requires you to upload images, and it will quickly remove the backgrounds.\n\nYou can also swap in new backgrounds or generate a new one using Adobe\u2019s Firefly AI. The image files can be uploaded from Dropbox, Adobe Experience Manager, and of course your PC. The edited image file can be saved in PNG and JPG format as of now. However, the company says that you\u2019ll soon be able to save them as Photoshop PSD files.\n\nOn the other hand, the resizing feature provides you with a variety of presets for social media and ad banners. So, how does it work? Well, the tool triggers generative AI to stretch the backgrounds of images to fit the selected sizes. As mentioned in the heading, the \u201cBulk Create\u201d can do all these for 10,000 image files with just one click. It\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019ll have to pay a fee, possibly through the premium Firefly service, to use this feature.\n\nThe company has also announced new Firefly Service APIs\n\nAdobe further mentioned that the Custom Models feature, which allows its users to \u201cfine-tune\u201d Firefly by training it on their assets, will be available under the Firefly Service APIs later this month. The Dubbing and Lip Sync tool that allows for translating videos into 14 languages will also be generally available as a Firefly Service API in the coming days.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cDigital avatars,\u201d an API built on Adobe\u2019s text-to-speech model, is available in beta this month. A new tool called InDesign, which auto-formats texts and images for print and media, will be generally available in February.

            "content": "The big picture: Traditional AI-based image tools often focus on generating images from scratch using text prompts, which has invited controversy due to copyright concerns. Firefly, however, leverages prompts to make complex edits to existing images within Adobe programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. Users can seamlessly add objects while maintaining consistent lighting, introduce new patterns, remove backgrounds, or extend image boundaries \u2013 though sometimes with unintentionally humorous results.\n\nAdobe has added numerous features to its Firefly GenAI suite since its introduction in 2023. The latest update enables companies to adjust images in bulk \u2013 and when they say bulk they are claiming by the thousands, if necessary. Known as Firefly Bulk Create, this tool aims to accelerate advertising and messaging campaigns by making image alterations more efficient. While some critics worry that this technology might erode human artistry in advertising, Adobe's press release promotes the new tools as a means to cut through tedious work.\n\nAccording to a now-removed Adobe press release (perhaps deemed too contentious for its audience?), the Bulk Create feature can automate tasks like removing backgrounds, resizing images, and making other adjustments that would otherwise be repetitive if done manually. The functionality could facilitate large-scale communication by helping companies and organizations quickly customize assets for multiple channels and platforms.\n\nCurrently, Bulk Create appears as two distinct functions within the Firefly web app. One function enables users to upload images, change their backgrounds, and save copies in batches as PNGs or JPEGs. The other function automatically adjusts image dimensions to fit the requirements of social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook by stretching or resizing backgrounds.\n\nIn addition to Bulk Create, Adobe plans to introduce a new method for automating brand layouts in Firefly next month. This feature, entering beta, will integrate InDesign APIs with various data sources, allowing companies to arrange text and images into templates for posters, magazines, and other advertising formats.\n\nAlthough Adobe mostly advertises its AI tools by discussing how it reduces the tedious aspects of editing pictures on a mass scale, the company still mentions the controversial use of GenAI for creating new images or performing tasks traditionally handled by human artists.\n\nFor instance, Adobe is launching GenAI avatars in beta this month, featuring capabilities like text-to-speech and automatic animation. Additionally, AI-based translation, dubbing, and lip-syncing for videos are expected to exit beta soon.\n\nSince the launch of Firefly, Adobe has attempted to address fears about copyright and the potential impact of GenAI on human creativity. The toolset is partially trained on stock photos, and Adobe has promised to compensate artists who contribute to improving the AI. Despite this, skepticism remains prevalent, as the debate over the ethical implications of GenAI remains contentious.",

            "content": "The past couple of years have delivered a paradox for STEM talent in the U.S. Despite macroeconomic headwinds prompting notable job cuts at employers from Big Tech to Big Pharma, science- and engineering-focused firms still struggle to find the specialized expertise they need. Recent Indicators reports from the National Science Board (NSB) describe an \u201c accelerating science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) talent crisis ,\u201d citing chronic shortfalls in critical areas such as advanced manufacturing and biotech research\u2014even as certain tech-heavy occupations (e.g., traditional front-end or back-end developer roles) have seen an oversaturation of candidates.\n\n[Updated on January 12 with additional data]\n\nThe broader workforce is poised to see one of the largest shakeups in recent memory. According to the WEF\u2019s Future of Jobs Report 2025, while 170 million new jobs are expected to be created by 2030, 92 million current jobs may be displaced.\n\nWEF Market Outlook 2025-2030 \u2022 63% of employers WEF surveyed cite skill gaps as the primary barrier to business transformation.\n\n\u2022 Only 29% of businesses expect talent availability to improve over 2025\u20132030.\n\n\u2022 86% of respondents expect AI and information processing technologies to transform their business by 2030.\n\nSource: The Future of Jobs Report 2025\n\nMeanwhile, the NSB notes that the U.S. remains heavily reliant on foreign-born talent\u2014especially from China and India\u2014to fill roles in AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology. China has already eclipsed the United States in several scientific benchmarks, including its share of top-cited research papers and international patent applications. According to a recent Nature feature, China\u2019s R&D spending is poised to match U.S. levels by 2030. The same publication ranked the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the top of global research institutions, with a 2023 share of 2243.22\u2014nearly double that of second-place Harvard University (1143.43). China-based organizations also make up a growing share of top research organizations.\n\nFor U.S. employers grappling with intensified global competition and a limited domestic pipeline for specialized talent, the result is a sharp mismatch. Even as fresh cohorts of developers saturate some software roles, advanced positions in semiconductors (despite significant hardware layoffs), biotech, and other technology segments often remain understaffed.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, our review of roughly 1,000 active STEM job postings\u2014which also draws on data from agencies like the NSF and the New York Fed\u2014reveals six recurring \u201cmust-have\u201d skill clusters for R&D and STEM roles in 2025. While the exact mix of required competencies differs across industry niches (e.g., biotech vs. semiconductor vs. advanced manufacturing), these skill clusters consistently appear in job postings for R&D settings everywhere from biotech labs and semiconductor factories to DevOps teams and advanced research centers.\n\nCluster Primary Domains Key Skills/Focus 1. Research and data analysis Healthcare R&D\n\nLife Sciences R&D Python, Data Analysis, Bioinformatics\n\nStatistical Modeling, ML 2. Product/software dev for R&D Healthcare Product Dev\n\nEng. Design & Dev AWS Cloud\n\nGit/Version Control\n\nTesting Frameworks\n\nProgramming (Python, C++) 3. CAD-driven engineering Eng. & Mfg (Design)\n\nHealthcare Devices CAD Tools (AutoCAD)\n\nPrototyping\n\nISO/Quality Systems 4.

Infrastructure and systems Technical & Ops (Infrastructure)\n\nSome Healthcare/Eng. Operations AWS Architecture\n\nSecurity & Monitoring\n\nAutomation/CI/CD\n\nDegree requirements vs. skill mastery Based on a National Science Foundation data analysis (2015\u20132021), workforce composition metrics reveal distinct patterns: Physical Sciences: 91.7% specialized degree retention\n\n91.7% specialized degree retention Life Sciences: 82.5% field-specific credentials\n\n82.5% field-specific credentials Computing/Mathematics: ~20% non-S&E background integration This quantitative assessment demonstrates emerging flexible skill pathways in technical domains, particularly for competencies such as coding, data analysis, and cloud infrastructure deployment.\n\nA deeper dive\n\nBelow, we explore how these core capabilities shape modern R&D roles.\n\n1. Data analysis and programming\n\nIn numerous R&D environments\u2014from biotech and healthcare to engineering and advanced manufacturing\u2014data analytics and programming remain top priorities for STEM employers. Tools such as Python, R, and various machine learning frameworks appear regularly in job listings, while SQL and SAS also maintain a presence in academic and clinical research contexts. These roles apply computational methods to tasks ranging from genomic data analysis in computational biology to process optimization in manufacturing. National laboratories and forward-learning research organizations are more likely to emphasize experience with machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) for complex data analysis projects. For instance, a postdoctoral position at Argonne National Laboratory requires experience in deep learning with frameworks like PyTorch or JAX and scaling models on GPU-based machines. The trend is spilling into a growing number of R&D domains including national lab listings for research software engineering roles. Machine Learning/AI appears in 73 positions (14.7% of total listings) while compensation for senior AI/ML roles among the best-compensated in the dataset reaching close to $300,000 in some cases.\n\nSkills such as data analysis, statistics, math and programming aren\u2019t only valuable for their own sake. According to WEF, analytical thinking writ large remains the most sought-after core skill among employers, with seven out of 10 companies considering it essential in 2025.\n\n2. Cloud and infrastructure\n\nCloud computing has long since become de rigueur in many research contexts and this reality was reflected in STEM job listings. Several job postings mentioned expertise in cloud and containerization. Security and compliance requirements stand out in healthcare-focused roles, with 41% of research-oriented positions emphasizing secure protocols. Research hospitals remains a prominent employer, posting multiple specialized cloud positions (including Cloud DevOps Engineers and Research Scientists). From a technical skills perspective, AWS and Python continue figure prominently in postings followed by Azure adoption. Compensation data underscores the premium placed on cloud expertise: one senior technical position for Disaster Recovery Engineers command mentioned a salary range of $126,610\u2013$215,270. A specialized lead engineering role (e.g., Identity Services) offered $152,000\u2013$190,000 while data engineering roles had salary ranges in the ballpark of $120,000\u2013$128,000.\n\nWEF\u2019s The Future of Jobs Report 2025 indicates that AI and information processing technologies will have the biggest business impact, with 86% of organizations expecting transformation in these areas by 2030.\n\n3. CAD and design tools\n\nPhysical and product-focused R&D heavily relies on CAD software and integrated design tools for prototyping and product development. Those realities were reflected in job descriptions with general CAD competency having 264 mentions across the dataset. Manufacturing and simulation capabilities were recurring themes with a number of positions requiring integrated manufacturing workflow expertise and a few positions specifically calling for FEA simulation capabilities. For instance, a large medical device manufacturer lists a principal engineering position offering \u201c$126,000-166,800 for candidates with advanced industrial engineering experience.\u201d Another position at a legacy aerospace company emphasizes \u201cspecialization in low volume, high mix manufacturing and supply chain management\u201d with production engineering roles starting at $97,000.\n\n4. Data-driven laboratory and experimental techniques\n\nLab work is evolving in pharma and biotech research as well as in clinical lab settings and niche electronics testing as organizations focus more on data analysis platforms and automation tools. Modern scientists may transition from preparing PCR assays to interpreting large-scale sequencing data in bioinformatics suites. Key technical clusters include molecular and cellular techniques like PCR and sequencing, data integration using bioinformatics platforms and experimental design software, and adherence to quality standards such as GMP and GCP, alongside proficiency in rigorous laboratory protocols. For instance, in the job postings, one prominent research hospital was looking for candidates with experience working with high-throughput molecular techniques integrated with bioinformatics analysis platforms. A number of positions required both laboratory expertise and digital workflow integration, including proficiency in Python or R.\n\n5. Cross-functional communication and documentation\n\nTechnical documentation proved to be one of the most common skills mentioned in our dataset, noted in about 3 of every 10 job postings; meanwhile, roughly one-third of listings reference regulatory compliance or ISO standards. Nearly one-quarter of the postings emphasize the importance of cross-functional or collaborative workflows\u2014some even cite specific \u201cinterdisciplinary project requirements\u201d tying together data scientists with bench researchers in biotech settings or mechanical engineers with software developers in robotics. A number of listings in lab services and semiconductor settings mentioned cross-functional integration while a prominent medical device firm accentuated protocol development and integration with quality management systems. Across listings, robust documentation and cross-functional communication remain priorities in modern R&D and product development.\n\n6. Automation and robotics systems\n\nAs industries push for higher efficiency and reduced human error, industrial automation and robotics continue to grow in importance in R&D labs and manufacturing floors. In the dataset, about 13% reference these capabilities explicitly\u2014ranging from PLC programming in chemical processing (appearing in over 30 postings) to advanced robotics integration in assembly lines or high-throughput lab screening.\n\nAmong the jobs mentioning automation, several positions emphasize IoT-based control systems, SCADA architectures, or industrial control systems (ICS). In biotech R&D, for instance, automated pipetting robots can significantly speed up assay workflows, while advanced sensor arrays stream data to cloud-based dashboards for real-time monitoring. On a larger scale, some postings reference \u201cprocess optimization systems,\u201d referring to the development of feedback loops that can potentially tie robotics, data analytics, and machine learning together under one umbrella. As a result of such convergence, a single robotics engineer might now need experience programming both PLC logic and cloud-connected analytics platforms, while a process control specialist could require a grounding in mechanical systems, user interface design, and cybersecurity best practices.\n\nAmong job postings reviewed, about 40% of those focused on automation were leadership or management related while just over one-third (35%) were focused on technical Implementation and a quarter focused on research. A job posting at a large medical device company had requirements related to regulatory knowledge, interdisciplinary expertise, and experience managing large-scale deployments. Meanwhile, a listing at a national lab mentions the need to work with scores of visiting researchers along with the need to support large-scale R&D infrastructure and multi-stakeholder coordination.\n\n**\n\nFuture Workforce Implications\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025 estimates that \u201cif the world\u2019s workforce was made up of 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030.\u201d This underscores the critical importance of continuous skill development in STEM fields.**",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nThe Future of Rate Cuts in 2025\n\nThe latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025.\n\nSanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market\u2019s performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are \u201cthinking about yields.\u201d She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward.\n\nSanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out.\n\nThe market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAnalyst Upside as of January 10, 2025: 49%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been disrupting the generative AI industry. Some of its major products include Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, and Adobe GenStudio. The company\u2019s journey to becoming a GenAI giant has been prominent over the last few quarters. Earlier in 2024, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) launched a digital asset management system and later in the year announced the general availability of Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition on its Adobe Experience Cloud.\n\nIn October 2024, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) launched the Firefly Video Model in beta, expanding its family of creative generative AI models, safe for commercial use. Similarly, in December 2024, the company announced a partnership with Box, Inc. to shape the way digital media is created and used. With this new integration, users will be able to create the content they need within seconds using AI.\n\nThe company holds precedence in the creative industry because of its exemplary tools and features. In addition to that, investors are particularly interested to see how its investments in AI play out in 2025 and beyond. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target implies an upside of 49% from current levels.\n\nPolen Capital\u2019s Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.\u201d\n\nOverall ADBE ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Shares of Adobe, the digital media powerhouse, faced a dramatic 25.5% decline in 2024. Despite exceeding expectations significantly, investor confidence took a hit, raising questions about the company\u2019s future amid evolving market dynamics.\n\nAdobe concluded its fiscal year on November 29, 2024, and reported strong financial performance across the board. Revenue surpassed initial estimates, reaching $21.51 billion compared to the predicted range of $21.3 billion to $21.5 billion. Moreover, the company\u2019s digital media net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) hit $2 billion, beating the guidance of $1.9 billion. Other metrics, including a notable increase in digital media segment revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.42, also surpassed forecasts.\n\nDespite the robust results, share prices plummeted. Analysts from major firms like Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo were quick to reduce their price targets, largely due to uncertainties surrounding Adobe\u2019s future earnings potential and its AI initiatives, especially the Firefly tool. While some view Adobe\u2019s AI capabilities as a promising avenue for future growth, others worry about fierce competition and potential challenges in monetizing these innovations. Concerns also include shifting dynamics in the creative industries, which may impact Adobe\u2019s customer base.\n\nThe contrasting perspectives highlight a pivotal moment for Adobe as it navigates the complexities of an AI-driven marketplace and attempts to reassure investors of its long-term profitability.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Uncertain Future: Navigating Challenges and Opportunities in a Dynamic Market\n\nOverview of Adobe\u2019s Fiscal Performance\n\nIn the fiscal year ending November 29, 2024, Adobe solidified its status as a digital media leader, reporting impressive financial metrics that exceeded market expectations. The company posted a revenue of $21.51 billion, surpassing predictions set between $21.3 billion and $21.5 billion. Additionally, Adobe achieved significant milestones in its digital media segment, with net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) reaching $2 billion, exceeding its guidance of $1.9 billion.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\n\u2013 Total Revenue: $21.51 billion\n\n\u2013 Digital Media ARR: $2 billion\n\n\u2013 Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share: $18.42\n\n\u2013 Digital Media Segment Revenue: Notably increased from prior year\n\nPros and Cons of Adobe\u2019s Current Strategy\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong Financial Performance: Adobe has shown robust revenue figures and earnings that exceed forecasts, demonstrating resilience in a competitive market.\n\n\u2013 Growth in AI Initiatives: Innovations like the Firefly tool represent a significant push towards integrating artificial intelligence into Adobe\u2019s offerings, potentially providing new revenue streams.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Declining Share Prices: Despite strong earnings, shares of Adobe dropped 25.5%, indicating a lack of investor confidence in sustained growth.\n\n\u2013 Intense Competition: Adobe faces fierce competition in the AI and creative software sectors, which could impact its market share and profitability.\n\n\u2013 Market Uncertainty: Analysts have expressed concerns about Adobe\u2019s future earnings potential amidst shifting dynamics in the creative industries.\n\nExploring Adobe\u2019s AI Innovations\n\nAdobe\u2019s initiatives in artificial intelligence, particularly with tools like Firefly, aim to transform creative processes. The AI-driven solutions could enhance productivity for users; however, the monetization of these innovations poses a challenge. To fully leverage AI, Adobe must address competitive pressures and find an effective strategy to capitalize on its advanced technologies.\n\nCurrent Market Trends\n\nAs digital media landscapes evolve, companies like Adobe are required to adapt swiftly. The rise of AI in creative industries not only opens new opportunities but also threatens traditional business models. Adobe must navigate these changes to maintain relevance and market leadership.\n\nSecurity and Sustainability Aspects\n\nWith increasing reliance on digital media, security surrounding user data and creative assets has become paramount. Adobe needs to enhance its security protocols to protect its users against growing cyber threats. Moreover, sustainability practices should be integrated into its business model to appeal to a socially conscious customer base.\n\nFuture Predictions and Insights\n\nLooking ahead, Adobe\u2019s ability to reassure investors about its growth potential will be critical. The company must demonstrate clear strategies for evolving its business model to incorporate AI, secure its market position, and provide innovative solutions that meet changing consumer demands. With ongoing investments in technology and a focus on customer needs, Adobe has the potential to regain investor confidence and establish a more stable growth trajectory.\n\nFor more insights into Adobe\u2019s financial performance and innovations, visit Adobe\u2019s official site.",

            "content": "How the editors of \u201cEno\u201d used Premiere Pro and After Effects to cut the first generative film\n\nImage Source: Film First.\n\nEdited by Maya Tippett and Marley McDonald, \u201cEno\u201d is an Oscar-shortlisted documentary about Brian Eno, the visionary musician who produced numerous top tier artists including David Bowie, U2 and Coldplay.\n\nIn addition to showcasing Eno\u2019s rich archive of hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage and unreleased music, director Gary Hustwit and creative technologist Brendan Dawes developed bespoke generative software that sequences a human-coded mixture of scenes, music and interviews to create a film that is never the same twice.\n\nAs the first ever \u201cgenerative\u201d film, Tippett and McDonald relied on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects to manage Eno\u2019s technical complexity. They had to put aside everything they knew about telling a linear story and learn how to edit in a more module-based, systematic way, relying on features like Speech to Text to weed through archival interviews. Premiere Pro\u2019s customizability also allowed them to channel a \u201cEno-esque artistic freedom to have fun with the material,\u201d said McDonald.\n\nWe sat down with both \u201cEno\u201d editors for an inside look at the making of this innovative film.\n\nHow and where did you first learn to edit?\n\nTippet: I first learned to edit in camera on a VHS point-and-shoot when I was 12. That\u2019s where the concept of intentionally \u201ccutting\u201d and creating a montage to tell a story clicked for me. It was a tactile way of learning to make movies because I could immediately learn by watching what I had just done in the camera's playback. Later, I turned to the computer, started editing in iMovie, and made many terrible films with my friends while growing up. I always got the most excited and thrilled when I could stay up late, alone, and edit our footage into something to share.\n\nMcDonald: My first experience editing was making music videos with my sisters on the family camcorder. We had to do all of our editing in camera \u2014 hitting pause on the video camera and the boombox at the exact same time, no easy feat.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nTippet: I start by watching everything and only noting my emotional reactions; you can never get that first honest moment back. After watching the same footage over and over it's so important to remember what affected you before you get consumed and overly analytical about everything. From there, I start to see what universal themes are coming through in the project and I always try to build a scene or storyline towards those emotional moments. Something I learned from my mentor, Amy Foote, was to write down in a sentence or a word what the movie is about, put it on a Post-it and keep it visible on your desk to return to whenever you get lost. And I always have a notebook at my desk.\n\nMcDonald: Setting up a project is the most critical step of editing, from the moment you start to organize the material you are editing. For archival projects, I like to start by creating one bin with all of the footage. Then, meticulously sorting each clip into its relevant topic bin gives me a comprehensive overview of how much footage exists for any given topic.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out.\n\nTippet: While editing \u201cEno,\u201d whenever I hit a wall, I would come across a snippet of Brian\u2019s interview, some non-sequitur that would ring true to my current creative struggle and it would turn into a breakthrough. It was an incredible feeling to have the film's subject, Eno, teaching me how to be a better artist and editor while crafting the film about him and his work. Ultimately, this became a central theme of the film; deriving creative inspiration from such an accomplished artist. We wanted our audience to feel that way after watching it.\n\nMcDonald: Thanks to my parents, I grew up listening to a lot of dub and reggae, so of course Lee Scratch Perry was a central figure in my upbringing. As I continued on my own musical journey, it didn\u2019t take long to realize that Brian Eno had worked with all of my favorite musicians: Talking Heads, Laurie Anderson, David Bowie, Holger Czukay and Robert Wyatt. When I found a clip of Brian talking about drawing inspiration from Lee Scratch Perry, it felt like a full circle moment in my life; as if I had always been on the path to work on this film! So to me that scene is very special.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nTippet: \u201cEno\u201d was a massive challenge on all levels because we were making the first-ever generative film. \u201cEno\u201d director Gary Hustwit and data artist Brendan Dawes created specialty software to mimic Eno\u2019s music-making style. This means the film is never the same twice and is built by software from a human-coded mixture of scenes, music, interviews, etc. Because no one has ever done this before, there was a laundry list of technical challenges. Intellectually, from an editing standpoint, it was incredibly challenging because my co-editor Marley McDonald and I had to reorient the way we were trained to tell a story, which is linear. We had to figure out how to edit in more of a module and systematic sense. And since there is so much randomness built into the system, Marley and I had to create many more scenes than a typical documentary, so the software had a variety of material to pull from.\n\nMcDonald: Creating a film that changes every time it\u2019s played was a hugely challenging task. We had to come up with a new system for editing. For me, the big breakthrough was realizing that we could rely on what Brian had to say about his process of creating generative art. One of the most complex scenes to cut was Brian explaining what \u201cgenerative\u201d means, but once we were able to unpack that idea; we were able to cultivate a deeper understanding of what we needed to do to create the film.\n\nWhat Adobe tools did you use on this project and why did you originally choose them?\n\nTippet: We cut the film using Premiere Pro and Marley made animations using After Effects. We also used Photoshop as there were many archival photographs and film strips that needed cleaning to animate them. I\u2019ve been working with Adobe software for over a decade and I\u2019ve cut my last few features with it. I also used Frame.io to interface with directors/producers/clients from rough cuts to the final locked cut. It\u2019s a great tool to give and receive notes on, which is a massive part of being an editor.\n\nMcDonald: We used Premiere Pro and After Effects for this film. From the outset, the archival material was very playful, and we felt a real sense of Eno-esque artistic freedom to have fun with the material. Both Premiere Pro and After Effects are great tools for this.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nTippet: Always create your own keyboard shortcuts so the keyboard feels like a third hand to you and the AI transcription (Speech to Text) is a game changer for searching for specific lines in interviews or archival footage.\n\nMcDonald: Spend a day messing around with all the different effects it can do. It will pay off when you least expect it.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration, and why?\n\nTippet: Oh boy\u2026 my dad, my mom, my husband, my son, the nature that surrounds me, Brian Eno, Marley McDonald, Amy Foote, David Lynch, John Waters, Herzog, animals, colors, Talking Heads, outsider art, comic books, Mary Ellen Mark, seasons changing, good food, good friends, train rides, cooking, and estate sales.\n\nMcDonald: My friends. They make me laugh, think deeply, and help me express my deepest feelings. They are the best artists I know!\n\nWhat\u2019s the toughest thing you\u2019ve had to face in your career and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nTippet: The toughest thing I\u2019ve had to face in my career is self-doubt. It can still be a battle depending on the day, but getting older and caring less about what others think helps a lot. My advice for aspiring filmmakers is to stay honest with yourself and make things because YOU like it, not for other people.\n\nMcDonald: I think the biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned in my career is that no one will tell you to make your films, you just have to get out there and make them. I gained most of my personal filmmaking style through making my own short films, with the help of my friends, on nights and weekends. One bit of advice I\u2019d share is to work on other people\u2019s movies, even if you have to take a job at the lowest level. It may feel like you aren\u2019t where you are supposed to be but if you pay attention to the people you are working with, you will be sure to learn a lot!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nTippet: My favorite thing about my workspace is my 24-hour assistant editor, Mitch (my cat).\n\nImage source: Maya Tippett.\n\nMcDonald: My favorite thing about my workspace is a ball of onyx under my computer. It was a gift from my dad and makes me think about how cool it is to work with fossilized time.",

The 1TB Lightroom-only plan increases from $9.99 to $11.99 monthly, a 20% hike.\n\nBig (cost increases) in Japan\n\nRecent reports from Japan (originally published in Japanese) reveal the 20GB Photography & Lightroom plan will get a similar treatment there.\n\nCurrently priced at 1,180 yen per month, the monthly plan will increase to 1,780 yen upon renewal after January 15, 2025.\n\nAs in the US, any user who does not subscribe to the 20GB plan before January 15 will no longer be able to do so.\n\nThe report also claimed the annual lump-sum payment option, costing 14,080 yen (equivalent to approximately 1,173 yen per month), will remain available and unaffected by the price hike.\n\nAre you a pro?

Shares have lost about 11.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Adobe due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nAdobe Q3 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates\n\nAdobe released third-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings of $4.65 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.65%. The figure improved 13.7% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n\n\nTotal revenues were $5.41 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.37 billion. The figure rose 11% both on a reported and a constant-currency basis from the year-ago quarter.\n\n\n\nTop-line growth was driven by the strong performances of Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Accelerating subscription revenues also contributed well.\n\n\n\nGrowing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capabilities contributed well.\n\n\n\nAdobe\u2019s strong efforts to bolster its GenAI-powered offerings are expected to boost its prospects. The company\u2019s substantial investments in AI image and video generation to boost its presence in the design software industry are positives.\n\n\n\nHowever, ADBE faces stiff competition in the AI software space from other tech giants and well-funded startups like Stability AI and Midjourney.\n\n\n\nIntensifying competition might cause the returns from its AI push to take longer to materialize due to which its fiscal fourth quarter revenue outlook looks weaker.\n\nADBE\u2019s Top Line in Detail\n\nAdobe reports revenues under three categories \u2014 subscription, product, and services & other.\n\n\n\nSubscription revenues were $5.18 billion (accounting for 95.8% of the total revenues), up 11.6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n\n\nProduct revenues totaled $82 million (1.5% of the total revenues), down 14.6% year over year.\n\n\n\nServices & other revenues were $146 million (2.7% of the total revenues), decreasing 10.4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nADBE\u2019s Segmental Details\n\nDigital Media: The segment generated revenues of $4 billion, which improved 11% on a year-over-year basis. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.97 billion. The segment comprises Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Digital Media\u2019s annualized recurring revenues (\u201cARR\u201d) increased to $16.76 billion, of which the net new ARR was $504 million.\n\n\n\nCreative Cloud generated $3.19 billion in revenues, up 10% year over year. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.18 billion. Creative ARR was $13.45 billion. The company witnessed the solid adoption of Creative Cloud All Apps across various geographies and customer categories, which contributed well to subscription growth. Solid adoptions of Acrobat Pro, Illustrator, Lightroom and Photoshop single apps were positives. The growing traction across Express mobile offerings was a plus. Also, early monetization of the new Firefly Service solution in the enterprise segment and strength in higher-value Creative plans contributed well.\n\n\n\nDocument Cloud\u2019s revenues were $807 million, up 18% from the prior-year quarter. The figure surpassed the consensus mark of $791 million. Document cloud ARR was $3.31 billion. Solid momentum across the Acrobat ecosystem was a positive. Rising Acrobat desktop demand and mobile subscriptions across various customer segments and geographies contributed well. Strong monetization of AI Assistant with new Acrobat subscriptions was a positive. Growing enterprise and public sector sales, and solid momentum among SMBs drove top-line growth. Also, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extensions contributed well to growth in the monthly active user base.\n\n\n\nDigital Experience: The segment generated revenues of $1.35 billion, up 10% on a year-over-year basis and beating the consensus mark of $1.33 billion. Experience Cloud subscription revenues were $1.23 billion, rising 12% from the year-ago quarter. Strength across transformational accounts, and Data Insights & Audiences, and Customer Journey categories drove subscription revenue growth. Strong demand for AEP and native apps contributed well. The solid adoption of AEM and Workfront solutions was another positive.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "\u201cAI will be the most transformational technology of our lifetime,\u201d said Sam Garfield, industry strategy, Adobe. \u201cAdobe is really digging in on that.\u201d That was the overwhelming theme of the CES 2025 Gen AI Personalization: Advancing the Promise of Digital panel. Moderated by Linda Cronin, EVP, global media, Monks, Garfield was joined by Michelle Garcia, SVP, marketing, Paramount+, and Jacob Abel, head of marketing operations, strategy, media, Delta Air Lines, to dive into Generative AI and how it can help scale, improve personalization, and drive revenue in 2025 and beyond.\n\nBoth Abel and Garcia agreed: machine learning has been used for years\u2014AI is not a new creation. At Paramount+, for example, the streaming app always seems to know what you want to watch next or what kind of shows to recommend for future viewing\u2014an impressive feat for a catalogue ranging from Spongebob to Star Trek.\n\n[Integrators and AI]\n\nWhat is new, said Abel, is how marketing departments react to the Gen AI information. At Delta, it is an informed reaction, relying on a team to provide governance and make sure what the company is doing with AI is intentional. The use of Gen AI requires a huge investment in time and resources, so a plan is imperative to ensure AI is being used ethically and correctly.\n\nGarfield, referencing a quote from a podcast he had heard earlier, noted, \u201c2023 was the year of wow, 2024 was the year of how, and 2025 is going to be the year of now.\u201d At Adobe, the company is intentional in how they integrate Generative AI into each and every product. The tools need to be there, and now that they have been integrated and Adobe is comfortable with the outputs, 2025 is a year where Adobe can scale up and provide more.\n\nHe pointed out that Gen AI tools in any vertical need to be commercially safe AI tools. Brand safety is a big challenge, and Adobe\u2019s GenStudio for Performance Marketing checks brand safety guidelines. Adobe aims to ensure that everyone it works with feels comfortable with what they work with.\n\nEvery business, said Abel, has the opportunity to get to the 1:1 level. Thus, personalization is a top priority for both Delta and Paramount+ in 2025. The number of places Delta, for example, wants to communicate paired with where its customers want Delta to communicate with them is exponentially growing. Abel hopes scaling up with more knowledge and data behind Gen AI will get the right message to the right person at the right time.\n\nscn Newsletter A daily selection of the top stories for AV integrators, resellers and consultants.

The creative team at Paramount+ had a social campaign where people explained what their imaginary friend (IF) would be and look like. The team used AI to create those IFs and bring them to life, increasing engagement and interest in not just the movie, but Paramount+. \u201cThat is something that couldn\u2019t be done at the speed and scale without that [Gen AI] tool,\u201d Garcia said. In 2025, Garcia pondered how Paramount+ can take that unique win and scale it up to do it again.\n\nIn closing, each of the panelists told attendees what they most looked forward to in the year ahead. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about the video aspects,\u201d Garfield opined, whose Adobe Firefly now has a video model. For media companies, video is the rage, so Garfield is excited to see how fast it will move. Garcia is excited for the scalability and the possibilities of how Paramount+ can further superserve its massive viewership. Abel referenced Delta Concierge, announced Tuesday in the Sphere at the keynote, and how AI will bring value that Delta customers can feel, not just see, in the travel experience.",

The Content Authenticity Initiative started over five years ago when we started to see new features emerge in products like After Effects that allowed people to edit real video in a very fast way using AI. So this is before the advent of generative AI, but [it] allowed you to remove objects, mask and do things in video that made something very clear to us: The era ahead was one where we could no longer believe our eyes. In that sense, the question was: What do we do to help people demonstrate that something is real? Or if they\u2019ve edited it, how do we help them show how it was changed so that they can still be trusted? It wasn\u2019t developed to punish bad actors. It was developed to reward good actors who are willing to show the provenance and attribution of their work, which creators love. They want to get credit for their work, so they want to add credentials if they can.\n\nNow, in the age of generative AI and the ubiquity of these technologies, the importance of the Content Authenticity Initiative became 10x, because suddenly all of this stuff, anything in your mind could be generated in a second. In some of the models out there that are trained on the open internet, you can make anyone be doing anything. We realized everyone\u2019s looking for the same solution. The social platforms want a way to expose credentials of assets to show how they were edited or made. The enterprises of the world want to know which model was used to create assets, because if it\u2019s a non-commercially safe model, they may not want to use it in a marketing campaign.",

            "content": "Nine years ago, a simple dinner around a pot of pasta sauce sparked a journey that transformed my life\u2014and the lives of thousands of others. Over 700 dinners later, from boardrooms to houseboats, I\u2019ve learned one key lesson: The world doesn\u2019t need more productivity hacks or complex frameworks\u2014it needs more connection, gratitude, and inspired leadership.\n\nAt every table, a pattern emerged. Great leaders\u2014the ones who transform their teams, cultures and even themselves\u2014embody four archetypes. These archetypes are not traits you have to be born with; they are small practices/decisions/habits that can be developed by anyone who aspires to lead with impact.\n\nWhether you\u2019re guiding a Fortune 500 team or mentoring someone over coffee, these archetypes\u2014Reflective Listener, Insight Seeker, Connector, and Strategic Empath\u2014can help you build trust, unlock innovation, and create lasting change.\n\n1. The Reflective Listener\n\nGreat leaders don\u2019t just hear what others are saying\u2014they listen deeply. At our dinner table, we spend hours going around the dinner table listening to each others\u2019 shares. Reflective listening is about absorbing words and emotions without the urge to respond, interrupt, or redirect the conversation. It\u2019s about creating space for others to share fully, knowing that the act of being heard is transformative in itself.\n\nReflective listening builds trust, fosters psychological safety, and strengthens relationships. Studies show that miscommunication costs U.S. corporations an estimated $1.2 trillion annually. In corporate America, we\u2019ve prioritized speaking and output over the art of listening, and it\u2019s costing us more than we realize.\n\nLeaders who practice reflective listening can create environments where innovation thrives and people feel valued. According to a study by the International Listening Association, effective listening can boost workplace productivity by as much as 55%. Imagine a meeting where ideas are not only heard but considered thoughtfully, where team members leave feeling understood. This is what reflective listening achieves. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nTo embrace it, start by replacing \u201cactive listening\u201d (listening to reply) with reflective listening. Pause, absorb, and allow for silence. In fact, silence can be a leader\u2019s most powerful tool\u2014it invites deeper thought and helps uncover what\u2019s truly important; the emotion, the nuance, and the meaning behind the words.\n\n2. The Insight Seeker\n\nLeadership isn\u2019t about having all the answers; it\u2019s about asking the right questions. Insight Seekers use thoughtful inquiry to unlock the unsaid, uncover hidden opportunities, and guide others toward clarity and solutions. This archetype is essential in a world where assumptions often go unchallenged, stifling creativity and growth.\n\nGreat questions are catalysts for innovation. Consider the power of asking \u201cWhat if?\u201d to explore possibilities, or \u201cWhat\u2019s unsaid?\u201d to uncover hidden perspectives. These questions go beyond surface-level dialogue and invite exploration, curiosity and reflection. When leaders embrace inquiry, they encourage their teams to think critically, collaborate more effectively and approach challenges with a fresh lens.\n\nThe beauty of being an Insight Seeker is that it shifts the focus from yourself to the conversation. It\u2019s not about showcasing your knowledge; it\u2019s about unlocking the wisdom in the room. This archetype also requires restraint\u2014over-inquiry can overwhelm or frustrate others. The key is balance: Ask enough to open the door to discovery without shutting it with too much interrogation.\n\nIn a leadership context, Insight Seekers inspire others by showing them what\u2019s possible. Related Content\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. The Connector\n\nIf the dinner table taught me anything, it\u2019s that relationships are the bridges between ideas and impact. Leaders who embody the Connector archetype understand that relationships, not transactions, drive long-term success. They focus on building trust, fostering collaboration and creating environments where people feel valued and included.\n\nRelationships are the foundation of happiness and success. An 80-year Harvard study revealed that strong relationships are the greatest predictors of a fulfilled life. In leadership, this truth is even more significant. Teams led by empathetic managers are more engaged, productive and loyal. Leaders who prioritize connection create a sense of belonging, which is essential for team cohesion and performance.\n\nAs a Connector, it\u2019s not just about knowing people; it\u2019s about bringing the right people together. Consider this: At our dinners, we followed a simple rule. The first time you attended, you came alone. The second time, you brought a friend. After that, you could nominate someone to attend in your place. This structure ensured every dinner introduced new voices, new perspectives and new opportunities for connection.\n\nFor leaders, cultivating this same intentionality can transform your team. Ask yourself: \u201cWho needs to be in the room for this idea to succeed?\u201d and \u201cHow can I create opportunities for my team to bond and collaborate?\u201d\n\n4. The Strategic Empath\n\nEmpathy often gets dismissed as a \u201csoft skill,\u201d but the Strategic Empath knows it\u2019s one of the sharpest tools in leadership. Empathy is powerful because it aligns action with insight. Studies show that 80% of CEOs believe empathy is critical to financial performance. Yet empathy alone isn\u2019t enough\u2014it must be paired with action. That\u2019s what makes it strategic.\n\nThe right leaders ask questions like \u201cHow will this impact the people involved?\u201d or \u201cWhat actions can I take to support my team while moving us toward our goals?\u201d These leaders balance emotional insight with accountability, fostering trust and resilience in their teams.\n\nThe Strategic Empath also understands the importance of tough conversations. Empathy doesn\u2019t mean avoiding conflict; it means addressing it with care and clarity. It means both challenging and supporting. By focusing on solutions and outcomes, empathetic leaders inspire loyalty and drive progress, even in the face of adversity.\n\nLeadership for a Disconnected World\n\nAs we step into 2025, the need for transformational leadership has never been greater. The world is more connected digitally but more disconnected emotionally. These four archetypes offer a roadmap for leaders who want to create meaningful change.\n\nSo here\u2019s my challenge to you: Which of these archetypes will you embody today? Will you listen more deeply? Ask better questions? Build stronger connections? Take empathetic action? The choice is yours, and the possibilities are endless. Let\u2019s lead with purpose, connection and gratitude\u2014and see where it takes us.",

            "content": "Maris\u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for B-Cell Lymphomas were updated to include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment for patients with PET-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at end of first-line treatment.1,2\n\nThis decision marks the first inclusion of ctDNA MRD testing in these guidelines.1 In the guidelines, ctDNA MRD assessment is indicated as an alternative to biopsy for evaluating positive PET imaging results for patients who have achieved partial response or progressive disease at the conclusion of frontline DLBCL therapy. Patients with PET-positive, ctDNA MRD\u2013negative test results can follow the PET-negative pathway, which involves imaging and clinical follow-ups. According to the guidelines, only ctDNA MRD tests with an assay detection limit of less than 1 ppm are permitted for use.\n\n\u201cUntil now, [treatment] of patients with a positive or equivocal PET scan at the end of [first-line] therapy has been a challenging issue, particularly when biopsy is not possible. Furthermore, PET scans have a false positive rate, where 50% of positive scans or more are not due to residual lymphoma,\u201d Mark Roschewski, MD, senior clinician and clinical director of the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch of the Center for Cancer Research, stated in a news release. \u201cThe inclusion of ctDNA testing in the NCCN Guidelines gives us a powerful tool to address both challenges\u2014providing guidance when biopsy isn\u2019t possible and helping us more accurately determine which patients truly need additional therapy.\u201d\n\nThe update to the NCCN Guidelines follows the August 2024 submission of clinical recommendations by Foresight Diagnostics for the inclusion of ctDNA testing in the guidelines. Evidence for this submission was obtained by the Foresight CLARITY MRD test, a noninvasive test that uses Phased Variant Enrichment and Detection Sequencing to improve the error profile and sensitivity of ctDNA detection.3 A study investigating the analytical validation of CLARITY for detecting MRD in B-cell malignancies used clinical (n = 76) and clinical-contrived (n = 2) DLBCL samples compared with healthy donor plasma samples from non-cancer controls (n = 169) to assess the specificity of the assay.\n\nAnalytical specificity findings were assessed using cell-free DNA from 60 cancer-free donors and tumor-derived phased variant (PV) lists from 35 patients with DLBCL. CLARITY showed an overall false positive rate of 0.24% and a background error rate of 1.95 x 108, which translated to 1.95 mutant molecules in 100 million informative molecules.\n\nProbit models showed that the mutant molecules and PV allele frequency (PVAF) corresponded to a 95% detection rate for CLARITY. The limit of detection was 3.11 mutant molecules and 6.61 x 107 PVAF, translating to 0.7 ppm.\n\nThe assay\u2019s repeatability and reproducibility rate was greater than 96%. The assay\u2019s clinical accuracy was measured at 90.62% (95% CI, 74.98%-98.02%) positive percent agreement (PPA) and 77.78% (95% CI, 52.73%-93.59%) negative percent agreement (NPA) compared with a previously established single-nucleotide variant\u2013based MRD detection method. Seven discordant calls were observed between the 2 detection methods. In all discordant cases, the CLARITY results agreed with the clinical outcomes (PPA, 100%; NPA, 100%), and the comparator assay had lower clinical outcome concordance rates (PPA, 0%; NPA, 60%).\n\n\u201cThese updated guidelines also represent a significant step forward in reducing unnecessary procedures and treatment burden for lymphoma patients,\u201d Ash Alizadeh, MD, PhD, co-founder of Foresight Diagnostics and a professor of medicine, oncology, and hematology at Stanford University in California, added in the news release.1 \u201cWhen PET scans are positive, patients often undergo invasive procedures to confirm the result. Or, if results are not confirmed and the scan reflects a false positive, patients are exposed to additional treatment that they don\u2019t actually need. By using ctDNA MRD testing to adjudicate these cases, we can now better identify which patients can safely avoid further treatment, sparing them from significant toxicities and the physical, emotional, and financial burden of unnecessary interventions.\u201d\n\nReferences",

            "content": "How Premiere Pro and Frame.io helped \u201cBlack Box Diaries\u201d filmmakers tell Shiori Ito\u2019s powerful story\n\nThe Oscar-shortlisted documentary \u201cBlack Box Diaries\u201d tells the powerful story of journalist Shiori Ito as she navigates an investigation into her own sexual assault and attempts to bring the prominent perpetrator to justice.\n\nDirected by Ito herself and edited by Ema Ryan Yamazaki, the film follows Ito through her very personal journey and campaign to hold her assailant accountable. She not only becomes the face of Japan\u2019s #MeToo movement, but also launches a landmark case in Japan, exposing the country\u2019s desperately outdated judicial and societal systems.\n\nFacing the unique challenge of making a film where the director is also the main subject, Yamazaki relied on Premiere Pro and Frame.io to help tell Ito\u2019s story, which unfolds like a thriller and combines secret investigative recordings, v\u00e9rit\u00e9 shooting and emotional first-person video. With such a variety of footage to navigate, Yamazaki says Premiere Pro\u2019s customization options were essential: \u201cSpend the time to customize the keyboard to make it work for you. Every second saved with a keyboard shortcut will add up over the course of a project.\u201d\n\nWe caught up with Yamazaki to get a behind the scenes look at the four-year process of crafting \u201cBlack Box Diaries.\u201d\n\nHow and where did you first learn to edit?\n\nWhile attending NYU film school, I quickly realized I needed to learn a skill other than directing. I was drawn to editing, perhaps because I grew up as a dancer and was attracted to the idea of shaping stories using pacing and rhythm. I took a documentary class taught by Sam Pollard, who is a legendary documentary filmmaker and editor. I was inspired by him to pursue editing and ultimately became his editing assistant after film school.\n\nHow do you begin a project/set up your workspace?\n\nThe scariest thing is that blank timeline before anything is in it. Every time, I wonder, \u201cWill we figure this out and be able to tell a good story?\u201d I like to put all my clips in timelines organized by date and/or character, duplicate that master sequence and then make cutdown selects. These selects become the basis of my editing work.\n\nTell us about a favorite scene or moment from this project and why it stands out to you.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Shiori chases down Japan\u2019s national police chief who stopped her rapist's arrest warrant in an attempt to ask him why. She knocks on his window but the car speeds away. Moments later, Shiori says \u201cI should have eaten breakfast, and I could have ran faster.\u201d There are so many moments in this documentary that are \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201cstranger\u201d than any fiction script, things that can\u2019t be written. I love scenes where it feels like non-fiction surpasses fiction.\n\nWhat were some specific post-production challenges you faced that were unique to your project? How did you go about solving them?\n\nI had never worked on a project before where the director was also the main subject. Moreover, the subject matter involves this director/subject Shiori investigating her own rape case. It took us 4 years with breaks in between to get the story right and I had to learn how to navigate working with a director who is also the subject. Shiori did an incredible job separating her roles as the director and subject.\n\nWhat Adobe tools did you use on this project and why did you originally choose them?\n\nI used Premiere Pro to edit because that\u2019s been my preference on single-editor projects for a long time. We also used Frame.io to communicate with our colorist/VFX staff, as it\u2019s very convenient to be able to write frame-specific notes.\n\nIf you could share one tip about Premiere Pro, what would it be?\n\nSpend the time to customize the keyboard to make it work for you. Every second saved with a keyboard shortcut will add up over the course of a project.\n\nWho is your creative inspiration and why?\n\nRecently, I am most inspired by my 2-year-old son. Seeing your own child experience life and things for the first time gives me a new look on everything in my life too. The purity of his reactions to his surroundings and emotions are something I\u2019m learning from every day, as ultimately, I think it's a huge part of the job of a documentary editor to create scenes, sequences and films that capture authentic human emotions.\n\nWhat\u2019s the toughest thing you\u2019ve had to face in your career and how did you overcome it? What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers or content creators?\n\nFrequent rejections from industry gatekeepers like pitch markets and film festivals can really take a toll on your own belief of if your work is good or relevant. It\u2019s very difficult sometimes to be in an industry where your success depends on often subjective opinions of others. To keep believing that your work is important and keep going in the face of rejection is extremely tough, but necessary. Don\u2019t give up, keep going. That\u2019s my advice.\n\nShare a photo of where you work. What\u2019s your favorite thing about your workspace and why?\n\nI love my small editing room in the heart of a small Tokyo Neighborhood. Being the parent of an energetic 2-year-old running around at home, I cherish this space as mine where I can focus.",

The figures are not adjusted for inflation, but Adobe analysts said many categories saw lower prices year over year.\n\nAdobe also reports the 2024 holiday season was the most mobile of all time with smartphones driving 54% of all online purchases, up from 51.1% in 2023. The highest use for mobile shopping tracked by Adobe occurred on Christmas Day, driving 65% of online sales, compared to 63% in 2023.\n\nThe report also states that 79.1% of buy now, pay later (BNPL) transactions were made through a smartphone in the holiday season. BNPL usage hit an all-time high, contributing $18.2 billion in online spending, up 9.6% from $16.6 billion in the 2023 holiday season, Adobe reports.\n\nTOP CATEGORIES\n\nOf the $241.4 billion spent online during the 2024 holiday season, Adobe found that 54% was driven by three categories: electronics ($55.3 billion, up 8.8% year-over-year); apparel ($45.6 billion, up 9.9% year-over-year) and furniture/home goods ($29.2 billion, up 6.8% year-over-year).\n\nThe strongest growth was observed in grocery ($21.5 billion, up 12.9% year-over-year) and cosmetics ($7.7 billion, up 12.2% year-over-year), according to Adobe.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 holiday season showed that e-commerce is being reshaped by a consumer who now prefers to transact on smaller screens and lean on generative AI-powered services to shop more efficiently,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. \u201cIt presents opportunities for retailers to deliver new services and experiences that capture the attention of consumers, many of whom are now shopping online in different ways.\u201d\n\nDEMAND DRIVERS\n\nAdobe data shows that for every 1% decrease in price, demand increased by 1.029% compared to the 2023 season. This drove an additional $2.25 billion in online spending.\n\nStrong discounts this season also drove shoppers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, appliances, and sporting goods, according to Adobe. During the season, the share of units sold for the most expensive goods increased by 21%.\n\nAdobe also reports that social media influencers drove more demand during the holiday season compared to the prior year. Revenue attributed to influencer recommendations on social media comprised 17.6% of the total online spend, up 6% year over year. Social media advertising comprised about 5% of total holiday revenue, up 5.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) reports consumer spending on both goods and services grew 5.5% year over year unadjusted for inflation in November and December combined while disposable personal income was up 5.2%, year over year, helping boost consumer purchases online and in stores.\n\nWhile NRF won\u2019t release comprehensive December retail sales data until next week, spending is on track to meet or exceed NRF\u2019s projection for sound holiday shopping season growth of between 2.5% and 3.5% over 2023, according to Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at NRF.",

            "content": "Last year, Adobe updated its Firefly generative AI platform multiple times, the most recent coming in September. Over that time, the Lightroom and Photoshop tools that rely on the technology have gotten steadily worse and the system\u2019s choice to add a Bitcoin logo to a photo of a seagull is a perfect distillation of the problem.\n\nLast week, I struggled to get any of Adobe\u2019s generative or content-aware tools to extend a background and cover an area for a thumbnail I was working on for our YouTube channel. Previous to the updates last year, the tasks I asked Photoshop to handle were done quickly and without issue. Since, however, it\u2019s been a rocky road.\n\nView on Threads\n\nAll I was trying to do was make a little bit more room on that side of the frame so I could reposition the camera and lens Chris was using.\n\nEventually had to resort to the old-fashioned way of doing this and manually cloned out the area to produce the thumbnail we eventually published:\n\nThe issue with my request is apparently known by Adobe. When I reached out to the company for comment, a company representative pointed me to an article on Lightroom Queen where it says asking Generative Remove or Generative Fill to work in a space requires that the entire subject and anything related to it be selected or else it will try and replace it with something.\n\n\u201cSelect the entire object/person, including its shadow, reflection, and any disconnected parts (such as a hand on someone else\u2019s shoulder). Otherwise, the AI tries to rebuild the object based on what\u2019s left behind. For example, if you select a person and miss their feet, Lightroom tries to rebuild a new person to fit the feet,\u201d the article reads.\n\nWhile this kind of makes sense if you don\u2019t think about it too hard, it also is completely counterintuitive to the concept of the name of the tool and the result an editor is expecting.\n\nIf I am selecting a body part and asking a tool to fill or remove that space, zero percent of the time would I want it to replace my selection with its eldritch nightmare version of that exact same thing. What I, and any editor doing this, want is for what is selected to be removed as seamlessly as possible.\n\nAlso, this method does not always work, as I demonstrated last year:\n\nThis is a repeat of the problem I showcased last fall when I pitted Apple\u2019s Clean Up tool against Adobe Generative tools. Multiple times, Adobe\u2019s tool wanted to add things into a shot and did so even if an entire subject was selected \u2014 which runs counter to the instructions Adobe pointed me to in the Lightroom Queen article.\n\nAdobe also pointed me to an Adobe Community post that has some tips for getting better results out of its generative tools, and while I can confirm these do help, we\u2019re still seeing weird results even if we follow the instructions to the letter.\n\nThis loops us back to the Bitcoin situation. Yesterday, photographer Matthew Raifman shared a bizarre result Adobe\u2019s Generative AI produced in Lightroom. The Generative Remove tool saw a selection of a reflection and decided to replace it with a Bitcoin logo.\n\n\u201cAdobe has officially jumped the shark. Their AI remove feature in lightroom just added a bitcoin to my gull bird in flight photo,\u201d he shared on Bluesky. \u201cA bitcoin!?!\u201d\n\nRaifman shared a screen recording with PetaPixel that verifies this wasn\u2019t added on purpose and was the first suggestion from Adobe\u2019s AI.\n\nTo its credit, two of the three options Generative Remove suggested did provide usable alternatives. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin option was the first one, which (whether Adobe intends this or not) tells an editor that it is what the platform feels is the best result.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that Adobe\u2019s tools don\u2019t work well, it\u2019s more the manner of how they\u2019re not working well \u2014 if we weren\u2019t trying to get work done, some of these results would be really funny. In the case of the Bitcoin thing, it just seems like it\u2019s trying to replace the painted pixels with something similar in shape to the detected \u201cobject\u201d the user is trying to remove. But that doesn\u2019t make any sense in how editors would expect the tool to perform.\n\nEditors don\u2019t want something replaced with an object akin to what they select to remove, they want it replaced with what is around it. But, somehow, Adobe\u2019s AI just isn\u2019t coded to understand this and it repeatedly generates the weirdest stuff because of it.\n\nGenerative Remove and Generative Fill have become so unreliable that some members of the PetaPixel staff have stopped using it entirely. As I pointed out, I had to go back to the manual clone stamp method to get the task I wanted completed.\n\n\u201cOverall, Adobe is aware and actively working to resolve,\u201d Adobe tells PetaPixel.\n\nWhen Adobe is pushing AI as the biggest value proposition in its updates, it can\u2019t be this unreliable. It might be enough to fool shareholders into buying more stock but it\u2019s not going to make actual users \u2014 you know, the ones directly contributing to the quarterly profit margins \u2014 feel like they\u2019re getting their money\u2019s worth.\n\n\u201cThe idiom \u2018jumping the shark\u2019 or to \u2018jump the shark\u2019 means that a creative work or entity has evolved and reached a point in which it has exhausted its core intent and is introducing new ideas that are discordant with or an extreme exaggeration (caricature) of its original theme or purpose,\u201d Wikipedia notes. That feels pretty apt for what is happening here.",

This results in the easy creation of see-through elements such as smoke as well as accurate reflections and ethereal effects, which all blend and animation naturally in a scene.\n\nCurrently AI apps and models can only generate solid images, which restricts how the data and scenes being generated can be used. TransPixar has just changed the way AI generates effects and scenes, and could be truly a significant release.\n\nIn the white paper Yijun Li, project leader at Adobe Research, wrote: \"Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects, allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models.\"\n\nAs development costs in film and video games increase to wild proportions AI could be the way studios cut costs, and do so without reducing staff numbers. The hope is AI like TransPixar can make life easier for VFX artists, not replace them, while helping smaller studios and solo developers compete.\n\nIn the demos released with the open source code, Adobe's team showed how TransPixar can deliver impressive results, including a varied mix of effects, from simple text prompts. The demos include emerging smoke clouds, an electrical portal and a swirling asteroid belt. The AI model can even animate still images with transparent effects.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

TransPixar is in its early stages but I'd love to see how this is developed, perhaps as an After Effects plugin or Cinema 4D plugin.",

After that, hover to the Business Platinum Adobe Benefit box and click Get Started.\n\nYou\u2019ll then see a box that looks like this:\n\nImage Credit: American Express\n\nCheck off the box that says I Understand and agree to the terms and conditions and click Enroll.\n\nOnly certain annual prepaid subscriptions will be eligible for the $150 credit, so keep that in mind, as well. Remember, only subscriptions made directly with Adobe are eligible for the $150 credit.\n\nLastly, annual prepaid subscriptions renew automatically every year until canceled, so keep that in mind.\n\nAfter the Adobe credit is activated, simply use your Amex Business Platinum card to pay for any eligible Adobe subscription via this link, and you\u2019ll see a statement credit of up to $150 per calendar year posted to your account within 2 to 4 weeks after the purchase is made.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the $150 credit, call the number on the back of your card to check on the status of the credit.\n\nTypes of Eligible Subscriptions with Adobe\n\nImage Credit: Emily Bernal via Unsplash\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the types of eligible subscriptions.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud All Apps for Teams\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a suite of software applications that include:\n\nAcrobat Pro\n\nAcrobat Reader\n\nAdobe Express\n\nAero\n\nAfter Effects\n\nAnimate\n\nAudition\n\nBridge\n\nCapture\n\nCharacter Animator\n\nDimension\n\nDreamweaver\n\nFill & Sign\n\nFresco\n\nIllustrator\n\nInCopy\n\nInDesign\n\nLightroom\n\nLightroom Classic\n\nMedia Encoder\n\nPhotoshop\n\nPhotoshop Camera\n\nPhotoshop Express\n\nPremiere Pro\n\nPremiere Rush\n\nScan\n\nXD\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is sold in these plans:\n\nIndividuals\n\nStudents and teachers\n\nTeams\n\n\n\nOnly Teams plans are covered under Amex Business Platinum card\u2019s $150 Adobe credit, and prepaid, annual plans start at $1,019.88 per year per license.\n\nSome features exclusive to Teams subscriptions include:\n\nAdmin Console for managing licenses\n\nAdvanced 24/7 tech support\n\n2 1:1 expert sessions per user per year\n\nUnlimited job posts using Adobe Talent\n\nSlack and Microsoft Teams app integration\n\n1TB of cloud storage, Adobe Portfolio, Adobe Fonts, and access to the latest features and updates as soon as they\u2019re released\n\nSo, using the $150 Adobe credit would save you around 15% off of your total subscription fees. For this reason, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend going out of your way to purchase an Adobe subscription just to use the Adobe credit \u2014 but it would definitely make sense to pay using your Amex Business Platinum card if you actually use Adobe software to help run your business.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud Single Apps (Teams Subscriptions Only)\n\nIf you don\u2019t need the complete suite of products included in Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps, you can set up an annual prepaid subscription for single apps.\n\nHowever, all of these subscriptions must still be for Teams.\n\nIn other words, instead of buying the Creative Cloud package, you can purchase Adobe Creative Cloud applications \u00e0 la carte.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of how much each Creative Cloud for Teams application costs:\n\nAdobe Stock \u2014 $359.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $359.88 per year per license Adobe XD \u2014 $275.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $275.88 per year per license After Effects \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Animate \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Audition \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Dreamweaver \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Illustrator \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license InCopy \u2014 $59.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $59.88 per year per license InDesign \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Lightroom (1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n(1TB) \u2014 $431.88 per year per license Photoshop \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Premiere Pro \u2014 $431.88 per year per license\n\n\u2014 $431.88 per year per license Substance 3D Collection \u2014 $1,199.88 per year per license\n\nAdobe Stock enables you to access millions of high-quality, royalty-free assets for your next creative project.\n\nAdobe XD is a UI/UX software for designing, prototyping, and sharing user experiences.\n\nAfter Effects creates motion graphics and visual effects for film, TV, video, and web.\n\nAnimate designs interactive vector and bitmap animations for games, apps, and the web, as well as publish content to reach viewers on desktop, mobile, and TV.\n\nAudition allows you to create, mix, and design sound effects.\n\nDreamweaver is a tool to easily design, code, and publish websites and web applications that look amazing on any screen.\n\nIllustrator creates precise designs, illustrations, and vector graphics on desktop and iPad.\n\nInCopy helps writers and editor style text, track changes, and make simple layout modifications while designers work on the same document in InDesign, all without disrupting workflows.\n\nInDesign focuses on print and digital media, specifically with designing pages and layouts.\n\nLightroom is used to edit, organize, store, and share photos from anywhere\n\nPhotoshop is designed to help create graphics, photos, and art on desktop and iPad. This subscription comes with Adobe Fresco for drawing and painting.\n\nPremiere Pro allows you to professionally edit videos and film.\n\nSubstance 3D is a collection of 6 applications to create models, design materials, texture assets, and render scenes. These 6 applications consist of Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Adobe Substance 3D Stager, Adobe Substance 3D Designer, Adobe Substance 3D Sampler, Adobe Substance 3D Modeler, and Adobe Substance 3D Assets.\n\nAdobe Acrobat Pro DC With E-Sign (Teams Subscription Only)\n\nThe other way you can use your Adobe credit is to pay for an annual prepaid subscription to Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams.\n\nWe would argue that this is actually the more productive way to use your $150 Adobe credit. That\u2019s because it requires a much smaller annual commitment and offers some useful tools that your business can likely use.\n\nCurrently, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC now includes e-sign capabilities, so the subscription you\u2019ll want to look for is Adobe Acrobat Pro for Teams, which starts at $287.88 per year per license for an annual prepaid plan.\n\nFactoring in the $150 Adobe credit means you\u2019re saving more than 50% on your subscription cost.\n\nWhile Acrobat Pro is included in the Creative Cloud subscription above, this particular subscription plan probably makes more sense to you if your business doesn\u2019t necessarily have a need for creative software for video production, photo editing, and more.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a business that regularly creates PDFs and documents that require signatures, you may benefit enormously from Acrobat Pro.\n\nSome of the most popular features of Acrobat Pro include:\n\nSign and collect unlimited signatures\n\nMicrosoft 365 integration\n\nExport, convert, and edit PDFs (directly in the PDF)\n\nCollect e-signatures from websites\n\nAdd custom branding\n\nCreate searchable, editable PDFs\n\nCompare PDFs and permanently redact information\n\n\u2026 and the list goes on!\n\nPlus, your Acrobat Pro subscription comes with desktop, web, and mobile access, as well as 100GB of cloud storage.\n\nSecuring the Amex Business Platinum Card\n\nELEVATED OFFER Terms Apply / Rates & Fees The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express U.P.

            "content": "The stock images, videos, and music providers \u2013 Getty Images and Shutterstock \u2013 have agreed to merge to create a $3.7 billion company. Getty shareholders will own 55% of the combined entity, and Craig Peters \u2013 current CEO of Getty will head the combined entity. This news was welcomed by investors of both companies, with GETY stock rising 25% and SSTK stock rising 14% on Tuesday, January 7. With this merger, the combination is expected to result in annual cost savings of $150 million to $200 million. The new combined entity will result in a bigger competitor for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock.\n\nAdobe also offers a collection of stock images, graphics, and videos. While Getty and Shutterstock have a collection of 470 million assets each, Adobe\u2019s collection is smaller at over 300 million assets. There has been a rise in demand for images and videos amid the increasing adoption of generative AI. Adobe already offers AI-generated images and variations and text-to-image capabilities through its Firefly AI tool. Getty is also working on AI capabilities to enhance its offerings.\n\nAdobe stock has had a rough past couple of months, falling from levels of over $520 in early December 2024 to $420 now. Much of this can be attributed to a Q4 miss and rising investor concerns about the company\u2019s AI advancements, which seem to not be paying off as anticipated. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nAdobe\u2019s revenue rose 11% y-o-y to $21.5 billion in fiscal 2024 (fiscal ends in November). Digital media segment sales grew 12% y-o-y to $15.9 billion, and document cloud sales were up 18% y-o-y to $3.2 billion. The company is benefiting from migration of customers to high-priced subscription variants, driving the average revenue per customer higher. Although Adobe seems to have a stability in revenues from its subscriptions offerings, the AI advancement hasn\u2019t helped it achieve a better revenue growth rate thus far.\n\nLooking at ADBE stock performance over a slightly longer term, the changes over the last four-year period have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 13% in 2021, -41% in 2022, 77% in 2023, and -25% in 2024. While ADBE stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nNow, could ADBE face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a recovery? Even if we take into account the increased competition in stock images offerings and the overall slower than anticipated revenue growth from AI, ADBE stock seems to be undervalued. At its current levels of around $420, ADBE stock is trading at 9x trailing revenues, versus the stock\u2019s average P/S ratio of 15x over the last five years. While a slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, the current gap versus the historical average seems high, and we think this should narrow over the coming quarters. While Adobe is yet to see any meaningful growth from its AI investments, it stands to benefit from enhanced creativity and productivity solutions resulting in increased user engagement. As such, investors will be better off picking ADBE stock in the current dip for robust long-term gains, in our view.\n\nWhile ADBE stock looks like it is undervalued, it is helpful to see how Adobe\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

One of the best ways to do this is by aligning portfolios with great businesses trading at a discount.\n\nThe heart of every value investor\u2019s strategy and the viewpoint that will likely bring portfolios to a comfortable first-quarter performance in the coming months can be achieved by looking at some of the market\u2019s best and strongest businesses today, which don\u2019t have many of a reason to be trading at steep discounts. Yet, this is where the market gives investors rare opportunities.\n\nOpportunities such as Adobe Inc.

NASDAQ: AMD supporting a new wave in the semiconductor industry and sharing in some of Adobe\u2019s tailwinds today. Even in the consumer staples sector, Hershey Co.

NASDAQ: GOOGL and Meta Platforms Inc.

When it comes to Adobe, management knows exactly what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdobe MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 99th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 28.5% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength N/A Environmental Score -0.55 News Sentiment 1.24 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 13.69% See Full Analysis\n\nRecently, insiders decided to switch the entire business model into a subscription-based business, where all of Adobe\u2019s creator software products are bundled into a monthly subscription for customers to enjoy. Most\u2014if not all\u2014are happy to be locked into a 12-month contract with Adobe, and that says a couple of things about the stock.\n\nFirst, they have a monopoly in this area, as management knows they have very few competitors who offer the all-in-one package that Adobe has achieved here. Second, financials are now more predictable and stable than ever under this new business model.\n\nThat's why, even though it trades at 66% of its 52-week high, Wall Street analysts feel comfortable keeping a consensus price target of $575.85 a share. Compared to today\u2019s prices, that\u2019s a 37.4% net upside.\n\nIs AMD the Better Bet for Semiconductor Investors?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Today AMD Advanced Micro Devices $110.84 -3.33 (-2.92%) 52-Week Range $106.50 \u25bc $227.30 P/E Ratio 111.96 Price Target $155.83 Add to Watchlist\n\nFor most of the past 18 months, all the attention seems to have centered around NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and its role in developing artificial intelligence through new semiconductor technology.\n\nWhatever merits the company has had for its stratospheric valuations, they have created a massive imbalance across the industry.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 98th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 40.6% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength N/A Environmental Score -1.85 News Sentiment 1.32 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 36.43% See Full Analysis\n\nThis imbalance can be seen in stocks like Advanced Micro Devices, which have been left behind. NVIDIA trades at 92% of its 52-week high, while Advanced Micro Devices has lagged significantly behind at 54% only. Some on Wall Street are beginning to pick up on this widening gap, and it shows through price targets.\n\nFor NVIDIA, a consensus valuation of $164.6 a share would call for a 17.5% upside from where it trades today. It is still attractive but nowhere close to Advance Micro Devices and its current $187.85 valuation. The latter would imply a run of up to 55% from today\u2019s prices, significantly more attractive as a kickstarter for investors looking to get ahead in 2025.\n\nWarning: Hershey Stock Might Compound Your Wealth\n\nHershey Today HSY Hershey $173.03 +6.93 (+4.17%) 52-Week Range $140.13 \u25bc $211.92 Dividend Yield 3.17% P/E Ratio 15.87 Price Target $164.15 Add to Watchlist\n\nThere are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the stock generates a return on invested capital (ROIC) rate of up to 23%, and this is the foundation of wealth compounding, as annual stock price performance tends to match the long-term ROIC rate over time.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the fact that the stock has fallen to a low of 77% of its 52-week high today, creating enough ceiling room to give investors a great risk-to-reward setup in the company.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe equity market has climbed consistently over the past few years on the global economy recovering from the COVID-19-fueled slowdown. On the other hand, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key catalyst pushing the market to new heights. Tech-laden Nasdaq, home to some of the biggest AI investment plays, was up by 29% in 2024, adding to the 43% gain generated in 2023.\n\nThe big question at the start of the new year is whether the AI-driven rally is sustainable. Has the market run ahead of itself, as some stocks have increased by more than 200%, resulting in overstretched valuations? If history is anything to go by, investors have nothing to worry about, but be optimistic, as the equity market has always rallied each year after a 28% or more gain the previous year.\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, the artificial intelligence industry is expected to reach its peak in 2025, with a $2 trillion increase in capital expenditures over the following three years. Governments around the globe pushing for friendly regulatory conversations on AI ethics and safety should spur innovation in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI Capex (spending) over the next 3 years,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nThe fact that big tech companies are ramping up their AI investments to gain a competitive edge affirms AI rally sustainability. Wall Street experts expect several businesses to continue growing due to the untapped potential of revolutionary technology. As large-cap tech revises their AI capital expenditures upward, investors should position themselves for opportunities. Analysts at UBS expect AI capital expenditure to reach record highs of $280 billion in 2025, up from about $224 billion in 2024. The increase in AI capital expenditure is expected to result in game-changing innovations and development, which should support and fuel the AI rally. Nevertheless, the analysts have warned that AI revenues are likely to lag capital expenditures.\n\n\u201cBig tech firms will likely make more headway in monetizing their AI spending this year. While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind Capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d UBS said in a research note.\n\nAmid the expected increase in AI capital expenditure, analysts at BNY Mellon Wealth Management believe that \u201cAI\u2019s role in the world will surpass that of other technologies that propelled earlier periods of tidal change.\u201d Its increased roll should also strengthen bullishness in the equity market, broadening the gains, as in 2024.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Adobe implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership\n\n\n\nA look at the shareholders of Adobe Inc. ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nAnd institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.0% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 28% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called \u201cmarket movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. Hence, if weakness in Adobe's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Adobe.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Adobe?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAdobe already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Adobe's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Adobe. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Adobe\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Adobe Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$279m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access .\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

            "content": "Celebrating small wins: The Adobe Stock Minorstones collection\n\nImage Credit: Adobe Stock / Studio Firma/Stocksy.\n\nEach month, we highlight a curated collection of visuals that use imagery and imagination to tell stories about how changes in the world are impacting consumers\u2019 priorities, values, and behaviors. As we begin 2025, January\u2019s edition of the Adobe Stock Culture Insights series spotlights how some of the smallest victories can have some of the biggest impact on our day-to-day lives \u2014 what are often called the \u201cminorstones.\u201d\n\nTraditional ideas about when and how to achieve life milestones are changing for a growing number of people. Graduating from college, getting married, having children, building a successful career, buying a home, and the like have historically served as major markers of becoming a successful adult, but in recent years these events have become harder to attain. As our personal paths become less linear, people are increasingly embracing life\u2019s \u201cminorstones\u201d as more realistic achievements and markers of a life well lived.\n\nThis shift in traditional timelines and accomplishments is driving broader changes in consumer behavior and how brands engage with customers. The Adobe Stock Minorstones Collection presents a diverse range of still and motion visuals and graphics that show a wide variety of people learning new skills, achieving new personal bests in sports and fitness, and celebrating life changes and accomplishments in a wide variety of environments across multiple age groups and demographics.\n\nShifting life markers\n\nImage Credit: Adobe Stock / Creative Universe ; Adobe Stock / Eloisa Ramos/Stocksy.\n\nConsumers are finding value in re-examining life goals to determine which ones they can realistically accomplish as well as which ones align with their lifestyles and priorities. This creates a pivotal opportunity for consumers and brands alike to appreciate and celebrate achievements that go beyond buying a home, getting married and having kids.\n\nImage Credit: Adobe Stock / Diego Martin/Stocksy ; Adobe Stock / CreativeUniverse.\n\nYoung adults in the US are reaching the markers of adulthood later in life. In 2021, just 39 percent of 21-year-olds worked full-time compared with 64 percent in 1980. And only 51 percent of 21-year-olds were living outside their parents\u2019 homes compared with 62 percent in 1980. As the cost of living rises, young adults are returning home to live with their parents or extended families. (See the rise of boomerang kids globally). This isn\u2019t a new development in Asia and Africa, but for young adults in the US and UK, moving back home is emerging as a way to save money, manage loneliness and increase disposable income. This phenomenon shows no signs of slowing, as one study found 14 percent of US Millennials plan on living with their parents for 10 more years.\n\nAchieving goals that support physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing are the markers of contemporary minorstones: becoming debt-free, getting sober, divorcing, achieving new personal bests in sports and fitness and even getting a new roommate or celebrating half birthdays are all minorstone events. In fact, clothing brand Madewell has started celebrating customers' half birthdays by offering them a US$15 discount.\n\nImage Credit: Adobe Stock / Lea Jones/Stocksy ; Adobe Stock / fStop ; Adobe Stock / Marko Geber.\n\nOn a list of milestones they felt should be better recognized, young Brits listed leaving an unhealthy relationship (23 percent), coming out as LGBTQ+ (18 percent), completing a physical challenge like a marathon (16 percent), and seeking therapy (13 percent). Minorstones are often underpinned by mindfulness for a generation where more than half would rather be happy and unemployed than working but unfulfilled.\n\nBecoming debt-free is also a growing minorstone. Financial services company SoFi held a \u201cdebt graduation\u201d ceremony for one customer who paid off her student loans. The campaign was shared on social media, with fanfare that included a marching band.\n\nAlleviating milestone anxiety\n\nI mage Credit: Adobe Stock / Olga Murzaeva/Stocksy ; Adobe Stock / ADDICTIVE STOCK ; Adobe Stock / ADDICTIVE STOCK.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing awareness that everyone has their own path in life, and that expecting all people to achieve major life markers by a certain age in a time of uncertainty and global disruption is not only unrealistic but can also lead to anxiety, depression, and apathy.\n\nAmid falling birth rates, major changes in employment, the global economy and debt, many young people feel anxious about not being on the same timeline as their parents and grandparents. In fact, 77 percent of Millennials and 83 percent of Gen Zers in the UK feel pressure to reach traditional milestones, compared to 66 percent of previous generations.\n\nAnxiety around being able to achieve traditional milestones can be allayed with growing respect for and acknowledgement of these alternative paths. According to the WGSN report \u201cYouth Milestones\u201d in the EU 80 percent of people between the ages of 13 and 39 don\u2019t care about achieving life milestones in the same order as generations past. Weddings and baby showers are no longer the only symbols of success, as celebrations for career wins, sobriety journeys, and coming-out anniversaries rise.\n\nImage credit: Adobe Stock / Westend61.\n\nResearch shows that celebrating small wins is essential for maintaining motivation and improving overall life satisfaction. When people celebrate their achievements, they\u2019re more likely to remain motivated and pursue additional goals, creating a positive feedback loop of success and satisfaction. By contrast, skipping over minorstones by moving on to the next project or goal without acknowledgement can lead to diminished motivation, burnout, and apathy.\n\nGet creating with Adobe Stock multi-asset subscriptions\n\nStarting at just US$29.99/month, our multi-asset subscriptions are tailored to meet various creative needs, giving you access to millions of images, videos (now including 4K), music tracks, video and design templates, vectors, and more.

            "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) released online shopping data for the 2024 holiday season, covering the period from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, 2024. Based on Adobe Analytics data, the analysis provides the most comprehensive view into U.S. e-commerce by analyzing commerce transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories. Adobe Analytics is part of Adobe Experience Cloud, relied upon by the majority of the top 100 internet retailers in the U.S.* to deliver, measure and personalize shopping experiences online.\n\nRecord holiday season online, propelled by mobile shopping\n\nConsumers spent $241.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, up 8.7% year-over-year (YoY) and setting a new record for e-commerce. 15 days saw consumers spend more than $4 billion in a single day (up from 11 days in 2023). Mobile shopping hit a new milestone, with the majority of online transactions (54.5%) taking place through a smartphone this season (up from 51.1% in 2023); Mobile shopping was highest on Christmas Day (Dec. 25), driving 65% of online sales (63% in 2023).\n\nOf the $241.4 billion spent online this holiday season, over half (54%) was driven by just three categories including electronics ($55.3 billion, up 8.8% YoY), apparel ($45.6 billion, up 9.9% YoY) and furniture/home goods ($29.2 billion, up 6.8% YoY). The strongest growth was observed in the grocery ($21.5 billion, up 12.9% YoY) and cosmetics ($7.7 billion, up 12.2% YoY) categories, as consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing these goods online. Other categories with notable growth this season included sporting goods ($7.8 billion, up 7.4% YoY) and toys ($8.2 billion, up 7.8% YoY).\n\nConsumer demand driven by competitive prices\n\nStrong discounts this season drew in consumers who have become increasingly price sensitive. Shoppers found great deals in electronics, where discounts peaked at 30.1% off listed price (vs 31% in 2023), as well as toys at 28% (vs 28%), apparel at 23.2% (vs. 24%), computers at 22.8% (vs 24%) and furniture/home goods at 19% (vs 21%). Discounts also hit record highs for televisions at 24.2% (vs 23%), appliances at 19.2% (vs 18%) and sporting goods at 19.5% (vs 18%).\n\nThis season, Adobe\u2019s data showed that for every 1% decrease in price, demand increased by 1.029% compared to the 2023 season. This drove an additional $2.25 billion in online spend\u2014a figure factored into the overall $241.4 billion spent online\u2014and shows the stronger response to discounts from price-sensitive shoppers.\n\nStrong discounts this season also drove consumers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, appliances and sporting goods\u2014propelling e-commerce growth as a result. This season, the share-of-units-sold for the most expensive goods increased by 21% overall. Within categories, this figure was up 54% in sporting goods, up 48% in electronics, up 35% in appliances, up 32% in personal care products and up 10% in apparel.\n\nGenerative AI embraced as shopping assistant\n\nThis season, traffic to retail sites from generative AI-powered chat bots (shoppers clicking on a link to a retail site) increased by 1,300% compared to the year prior. Cyber Monday saw the biggest growth in chat bot usage, up 1,950% YoY. While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value that chat bots are playing as shopping assistants. In an Adobe survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers**, 7 in 10 respondents who have used generative AI for shopping believe it enhances their experience. Additionally, 20% of respondents turn to generative AI to find the best deals, followed by quickly finding specific items online (19%) and getting brand recommendations (15%).\n\n\u201cThe 2024 holiday season showed that e-commerce is being reshaped by a consumer who now prefers to transact on smaller screens and lean on generative AI-powered services to shop more efficiently,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. \u201cIt presents opportunities for retailers to deliver new services and experiences that capture the attention of consumers, many of whom are now shopping online in different ways.\u201d\n\n\u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 usage continues to rise\n\nWhile consumers drove record spending online, many are giving themselves greater flexibility with their budgets. This season, \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 (BNPL) usage hit an all-time high, contributing $18.2 billion in online spend, up 9.6% YoY and representing $1.6 billion more than the last season. Smartphones are the form factor of choice for consumers leveraging this flexible payment method, driving the vast majority (79.1%) of BNPL purchases this season. Additionally, Cyber Monday was the biggest day on record for BNPL, driving $991.2 million (up 5.5% YoY). Per Adobe\u2019s survey, consumers tend to leverage BNPL for purchases in electronics (per 57% of respondents), apparel (51%), video games (36%), groceries (33%), toys (30%), health/beauty (28%) and home/garden (19%).\n\nAdditional Adobe Analytics insights\n\nHot Sellers : Within the electronics category, top sellers this season included TVs, Bluetooth headphones/speakers, smart watches and fitness trackers.

Impact of influencers: Across major marketing channels, paid search has remained the top driver of retail sales this holiday season, with its share of revenue at 29.7% (up 1% YoY). In affiliates and partners\u2014which includes social media influencers\u2014share of revenue came in at 17.6% but has grown more substantially (up 6% YoY). This channel also outpaced retailer traffic from social media overall (around 5% of revenue share), which grew 5.4% YoY. Influencers are also converting shoppers (individuals making a purchase after seeing influencer content) 9 times more than social media overall. In Adobe\u2019s survey, 37% of GenZ respondents have purchased something based on an influencer\u2019s recommendation.\n\nAcross major marketing channels, paid search has remained the top driver of retail sales this holiday season, with its share of revenue at 29.7% (up 1% YoY).

Curbside pickup: The fulfillment method was used in 17.5% of online orders this holiday season, for retailers that offer the service (down from 18.4% in 2023). While usage has come down this season, a significant number of shoppers continue to find value in the fulfillment service for speed and convenience. This season, curbside pickup peaked on Dec. 23 (the day before Christmas Eve), driving 37.8% of online orders as anxious shoppers used the service to make sure they got gifts on time.\n\nThe fulfillment method was used in 17.5% of online orders this holiday season, for retailers that offer the service (down from 18.4% in 2023).

Cyber Week recap: Record online spending this season was bolstered by a strong Cyber Week (the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday), which brought in $41.1 billion online overall, up 8.2% YoY. Cyber Monday remained the season\u2019s and year\u2019s biggest online shopping day, driving $13.3 billion in spend, up 7.3% YoY. However, growth was stronger on Thanksgiving ($6.1 billion, up 8.8% YoY) and Black Friday ($10.8 billion, up 10.2% YoY), as consumers embraced earlier deals.\n\nImpact of inflation\n\nStrong consumer spending online continues to be driven by net-new demand and not higher prices. Adobe\u2019s Digital Price Index shows e-commerce prices have fallen consecutively for 27 months (down 2.6% YoY in Nov. 2024). Adobe figures are not adjusted for inflation, but if online deflation were factored in, growth in consumer spend would be even stronger.\n\nAbout Adobe\n\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

            "content": "Online spending rose 8.7% during the holiday season from last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics, as deals and the use of AI-powered chatbots helped inspire purchases.\n\nSales on retailers' websites and apps totaled $241.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, according to Adobe. The company's analysis includes more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million unique items and 18 different product categories.\n\nMore demand, not higher prices, drove higher online spending, according to Adobe. Adobe's Digital Price Index found e-commerce prices have fallen every month for 27 months. The company's figures are not adjusted for inflation, but if they were revised, overall consumer spending would be higher.\n\nThe e-commerce results are a promising sign for the retail industry, which has yet to report company-specific sales. Walmart , Target , Macy's and others will start to post their fiscal fourth-quarter results, including their sales over the key shopping season, in late February.\n\nOther early reads on the holiday season have looked strong, too. Retail sales for the holiday season in the U.S., excluding automotive sales, rose 3.8% year over year for the period from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online sales across payment types.\n\nDeep discounts motivated holiday shoppers to spend, according to Adobe's data. For every 1% drop in the typical price, demand for merchandise increased by about 1% compared with the 2023 holiday season, Adobe data found. That led to an additional $2.25 billion in online spending.\n\nVivek Pandya, lead analyst for Adobe Digital Insights, said as prices of groceries and housing remain elevated, consumers are waiting to buy nonessential goods at times of the year when they expect to pay less. He described that pattern as \"event-ized buying.\"\n\nFor example, he said shoppers have opened their wallets during Amazon's Prime Day event in the summer or during sales days such as President's Day and Memorial Day.\n\n\"There are certain moments and certain opportunities where we see them overindexing their spend, really driving forward, because they see the value,\" he said. \"And then outside of those periods, we start to see growth kind of draw back down.\"\n\nSome of the best online deals during the holiday season were in the electronics category, where discounts peaked at 30.1% off listed price; toys, where price reductions topped out at 28%; TVs, where discounts maxed out at 24.2%; and apparel, where price cuts peaked at 23.2%.\n\nElectronics, apparel, and the furniture and home goods segment were the three top categories for the holiday season, which contributed to about 54% of the total online spending, according to Adobe. Yet the biggest year-over-year spending growth came from groceries, which jumped nearly 13% to $21.5 billion, and cosmetics, which shot up by 12.2% to $7.7 billion.",

During this period, single-day online sales totaled more than $4 billion on 15 days, up from 11 days in 2023.\n\nSmart phones accounted for 54.5% of online transactions for the period, up from 51.1% a year earlier. Mobile shopping peaked on Christmas Day, accounting for 65% of online sales, compared to 63% from a year ago. Overall, mobile shoppers spent $131.5 billion between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31st.\n\nAdobe tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million shopkeeping units, and 18 product categories.\n\nDiscounts played a big role in driving holiday-shopping sales. For every 1% decrease in price, demand increased by 1.029% compared to the 2023 holiday shopping season, Adobe says. The increase in sales from discounts increased online spending $2.25 billion during the period. The increased sales from discounts are factored into the overall spending during the 2024 holiday shopping period, Adobe adds.\n\nDiscounts drove shoppers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, appliances, and sporting goods. Discounts for electronics peaked at 30.1%, down slightly from 31% in 2023, while discounts for toys peaked a 28%, unchanged from a year earlier.\n\nArtificial intelligence played a key role in driving online traffic, as the number of shoppers clicking through to an e-commerce site from an AI-powered chatbot increased 13-fold from a year ago. The uptick shows the value chatbots are playing as shopping assistants, even though the number of shoppers using AI-powered chatbots remains modest, Adobe says.\n\nOverall, consumers are welcoming generative AI as part of the online-shopping experience. A September 2024 survey by Adobe of 5,000 U.S. consumers revealed seven in 10 shoppers who used generative AI believe it enhances their shopping experience. In addition, 20% of respondents turn to generative AI to find the best deals, while 19% use the technology to quickly find specific items online and 15% use it to get brand recommendations.\n\nBuy now, pay later remains a popular payment option for online holiday shoppers, with BNPL volume totaling $18.2 billion during the holiday season, a 9.6% increase from a year earlier. Cyber Monday set a record for BNPL spending, with online shoppers taking out $991.2 million in BNPL loans, up 5.5% from 2023.\n\nElectronics was the most popular product category for BNPL, at 57% of volume, followed by apparel (51%), video games (36%), and toys 30%), according to Adobe.\n\nShoppers\u2019 use of curbside pickup during the holidays totaled 17.5% of online volume, down from 18.4% a year earlier. Use of curbside pickup peaked on Dec. 23, accounting for 37.8% of online orders that day.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 holiday season showed that e-commerce is being reshaped by a consumer who now prefers to transact on smaller screens and lean on generative AI-powered services to shop more efficiently,\u201d Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights, says in a statement. \u201cIt presents opportunities for retailers to deliver new services and experiences that capture the attention of consumers, many of whom are now shopping online in different ways.\u201d",

On balance, the online sales total was driven by higher demand, rather than higher prices, according to Adobe.\n\nYears of cumulative price increases have caused problems for retailers in recent quarters as consumers retrench and prioritise essential goods.

But where we think the trade is actually going to broaden out, and honestly, it has since mid-year, is into some of the users of AI. So, think about car companies that do autonomous driving or software companies putting that into their programs themselves, and even to some of the more cyclical names that, on the back end, can get some more productivity gains. So yes, the picks-and-shovels, the enablers of the trade, were attractive for the most part in 2024. We think AI continues to broaden out.\u201d\n\nThe analyst said he has done some \u201creverse DCF work\u201d and believes there are many companies that are mispriced and many that have the good news around them already priced in.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that analysts are talking about this month.

Packed with professional design tools, and available for a one-off cost, you can create just about everything you can in Photoshop, without requiring a Creative Cloud subscription. The interface is similar, too, and we found this a great piece of software for beginners and professionals.\n\nRead the full round-up below, where I've compared performance, tools and features, and platform compatibility to see which ones match Adobe's industry-standard software.

Affinity Photo No Creative Cloud subscriptions here Our expert review: Today's Best Deals View at BHPhoto Reasons to buy + Works on Windows, macOS, and iPad + Impressively large toolkit + No subscriptions, just a one-off cost Reasons to avoid - So many tools it may overwhelm new users - Some annoying interface choices\n\nAffinity Photo, from Serif, is positively packed with professional tools that make it a genuine rival to Photoshop for both Windows and macOS. There\u2019s also a tablet version if you're looking for one of the best Photoshop alternatives on iPad. But best of all, there are no endless subscriptions, just a one-off cost, making it ideal when working to a budget.\n\nYou\u2019ll find an impressively clean interface (although the UI can be occasionally glitchy). There\u2019s also no shortage of useful tools, including PSD file support, RAW Support, masking, layering, retouching, removing blemishes, curving, and a full set of 16-bit filters. In our review, we noted that \u201cthe list of tools is incredibly long, and rivals bigger, more expensive competitors, yes, even Photoshop itself.\u201d The only danger here, then, is that you may be overwhelmed by everything on offer.\n\nThe app is available as a standalone download. Alternatively, the Affinity V2 universal license, bundling the photo editor alongside Affinity Designer and Affinity Publisher , which offers great value if you're working across different design projects.\n\nRead our full Serif Affinity Photo review .\n\nBest free Adobe Photoshop alternative\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n2. GIMP A free alternative to Photoshop Our expert review: Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Huge number of features, easily extensible + Raw and PSD compatible + Free and open source Reasons to avoid - Complex interface and steep learning curve - No CMYK color mode (add-on available)\n\nGIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a professional, open-source photography powerhouse that works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. So, it's both the best Adobe Photoshop alternative overall, and an excellent free alternative, too.\n\nIn our hands-on review, we called Gimp \"our top pick for the best free photo editor, and comes with a huge array of professional-quality functions for fine-tuning snaps and creating your own artwork from scratch. \"\n\nGIMP boasts a huge number of features and functions that rival Photoshop. There\u2019s also a huge community of developers and artists who have created a wide array of plugins, making this a highly adaptable program. If you desire a specific feature, there\u2019s probably an add-on for it.\n\nThe interface is highly customizable, so you can pare things back or leverage multiple windows and toolbars as needed. For this reason, GIMP has a similarly steep learning curve as Photoshop, but once you\u2019ve made your way through a few tutorials, it\u2019s quite comfortable.\n\nIn our experience, GIMP was slightly less responsive and used a few more resources than its proprietary counterpart, but this can be easily forgiven on the basis that GIMP always has been and always will be free and open source.\n\nRead our full GIMP review.\n\nBest Photoshop alternative online\n\n(Image credit: Pixlr)\n\n3. Pixlr X Edit in your browser for free Our expert review: Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Layer support + Web-app, available from any browser + Clean design + Intuitive workflow experience Reasons to avoid - Missing some features (e.g., custom brushes) - Limited filetype compatibility (no PSD) - Online only\n\nPixlr is one of the best free Photoshop alternatives online - but what makes this a good pick is that it's available as a web app. During our review of the HTML 5 photo editing software, we said it's \"so feature-packed, it gives desktop apps a serious run for their money.\"\n\nThe Pixlr interface is more spartan than either Photoshop or GIMP, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. The workflow is streamlined and intuitive: you can drag-and-drop a photo from your computer or add a URL, and then get to work adjusting images with familiar one-click filters and sliders.\n\nGiven that it\u2019s a web app, Pixlr has surprisingly robust layer support - one of the reasons why it's considered one of the best Photoshop alternatives. However, important features are still missing.

We found this app to be an ideal middle-ground if you're not quite a beginner, but not yet a pro.\n\nWhen we tested out the software, we found a versatile alternative to Photoshop. It might not match every powerful feature in Adobe\u2019s top tool, but it delivers most tools for most photo editors.\n\nThe latest features include AI-based tools such as \u2018AI Actions\u2019 which help you perform potentially time-consuming tasks such as blurring a background, or selecting an object, with just the click of a button. \u2018AI Face Edit\u2019 is interesting as it allows you to alter the face of a subject, and the end result is pretty impressive.\n\nMonthly and annual subscriptions are available, bundling Photo Studio Ultimate alongside Gemstone Photo Editor, Luxea Video Editor , Video Converter Pro, and Photo Studio for Mac for $9 / \u00a38 / $15AUD a month or $89 / \u00a379 / $142AUD a year. You\u2019ll get free updates and upgrades as long as your subscription remains active, are allowed up to five users per product, get 100GB of cloud storage, and have access to tutorials and workshops.\n\nAlternatively, it can be yours outright for the one-off price of $150 / \u00a3132 / $239AUD. This includes a year of free updates and technical support.\n\nOverall, a great Photoshop alternative for creating professional-looking content while working to a budget.\n\nRead our full ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate review .\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative for photographers\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n5. Luminar Neo Powerful without the Photoshop complexity Our expert review: Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Skylum Reasons to buy + Leverages AI for impressive features + Available as standalone or Adobe/Apple plug-in + Sync AI edits across photos + Download new skies or upload your own Reasons to avoid - Can be heavy on system resources - No mobile version or web app\n\nPhotoshop is loaded with AI tools - so a good alternative should also boast at least some of these features. And that's precisely what Luminar Neo offers.\n\nThis app features a wealth of industry-standard AI tools that should make design and content creation so much easier (and, presumably, faster). This includes tweaking curves, white balance, a cropping tool, and Luminar's much-vaunted sky replacement tool. In our tests, these worked very well, overall. Aside from a couple of hitches, we were left generally rather impressed with results.\n\nSo, who's it good for? Our sense is that this is the ideal tool for amateur photographers. Unfortunately, for professional use, it's missing certain features and performance, as with its simpler sister software Luminar AI, can be occasionally spotty. But once you get going, the overall experience of using Neo is surprisingly fluid, with more than enough fine-tuning tools for perfectionists.\n\nRead our full Luminar Neo review.\n\nBest alternative to Adobe Photoshop for businesses\n\n(Image credit: Photo Pos Pro)\n\n6. Photos Pos Pro Great for creating marketing assets and documents Our expert review: Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Customizable interface + Support for scripts, batch editing, and one-click editing tools + Raw and PSD compatible Reasons to avoid - Limited set of filters - Limited keyboard shortcuts\n\nWe're ranking this as one of the best Photoshop alternatives - particularly for small teams and businesses - because it's just so feature-rich, Photo Pos Pro comes with tools for editing images, web design, and document creation. Pretty much any design work you need can be handled here. Better still, it has a twin-track interface: one for beginners, one for experts.\n\nThis customizable interface lets you select either Novice or Pro layouts. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but essentially, the novice layout sacrifices power for usability, while the pro layout is feature-rich, albeit with a steep learning curve. Even if it\u2019s not executed perfectly, this flexibility is commendable and practical.\n\nWhile it lacks the deep customization that professional photographers rely on, it's still one of the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives for making adjustments to photos for presentations, marketing campaigns. An ideal tool for professional use in a business or office setting, particularly if you don't have time to learn the intricacies of Adobe's tool.\n\nWith layers, masking, brushes, scripts, and batch editing, Photos Pos Pro is a feature-rich alternative to Photoshop.\n\nRead our full Photo Pos Pro review.\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative for artists\n\n(Image credit: Krita)\n\n7. Krita A top tool for on-the-go artists Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Excellent tablet support for drawing + Highly customizable brush engine + Vector and raster capabilities + Large community Reasons to avoid - Some photo editing features missing\n\nKrita is open-source and free alternative to Adobe Photoshop, backed by a huge community of developers and talented artists who share artwork and methods. If you\u2019re looking for an active user base that\u2019s invested in discussing and sharing art, Krita is a great Photoshop alternative for drawing.\n\nBeyond the community, Krita is an incredibly powerful photo editing software, with hundreds of brushes and a brush customization engine, vector and text capabilities for comic strips, a wrap-around mode for seamless repeating images and patterns, and a powerful resource manager for importing tools from other artists.\n\nWe found the interface intuitive and familiar, with minor functions like being able to scroll sliders with the trackpad and having helpful tooltips that let us know to find the right tool.\n\nKrita isn't one of the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives for its photo editing tools. In fact, it's more of a drawing tool than a photo editor. For that reason, certain features are missing: fewer photo filters, no automatic heal tool, etc. It does, however, support opening and saving PSD files.\n\nAlso, Krita has fantastic tablet support with custom sensitivity settings, so for artists looking to combine drawing and photos, it\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative FAQs\n\nHow to choose the best Adobe Photoshop alternative for you\n\nWhen deciding which alternative to Photoshop is best for you, first consider how much of your relevant image file you need to edit and change. If you\u2019re just trying to make simple edits to an existing image file, you may find a free software program will suit you fine.\n\nHowever, if you plan to develop a file from scratch and/or plan to make a series of complicated edits using advanced photo-editing tools and filters, it may be better to aim for one of the higher range and more expensive programs on our list.\n\nYou should also check your current computer specs. Photo editors tend to have low minimum requirements, but for more seamless workflows, you may need a higher-power device. To help with this, we've reviewed the best laptops for graphic design, best laptops for photo editing, and best photo editing PCs. For professionals, we also recommend choosing one of the best monitors for photo editing.\n\nHow we tested the best alternatives to Adobe Photoshop\n\nTo test for the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service using a handful of images to see how the software could be used for the editing and development of each image. The aim was to push each software platform to see whether it could simply and easily not just edit a range of content types but also do so faithfully and consistently without introducing formatting issues or similar problems.\n\nGet in touch\n\nWant to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

One patient experienced a grade 5 adverse effect (AE) of cardiac arrest post-study treatment, which was determined to be unrelated to the study drug and attributed to a non-study drug overdose.\n\nHematologic secondary primary malignancies\u2014specifically myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\u2014were reported in 3 patients. These were determined to be unrelated AEs associated with disease progression in individuals heavily pretreated with agents known to be linked to MDS. No secondary primary malignancies directly related to treatment were observed.\n\nEarly efficacy findings demonstrated that treated patients (n = 38) achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%; 79% achieved a complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR). Additionally, 13% of patients experienced a very good partial response (VGPR), and 8% had a PR. Among evaluable patients (n = 28), 89% achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at a sensitivity threshold of 10\u207b\u2075.\n\n\u201cThese results position anito-cel as a favorable treatment option for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, including high-risk patient subgroups, with promising safety and efficacy outcomes,\u201d lead study author, Michael R. Bishop, MD, said in an interview with OncLive\u00ae.\n\nBishop serves as director of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program at the University of Chicago in Illinois.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe phase 1 study enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody, or those with triple-refractory disease following treatment with these 3 classes of agents.\n\nEligible patients needed to have measurable disease. Additional inclusion criteria included an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate organ function.\n\nPatients underwent apheresis fto collect cells used in the manufacturing of anito-cel. Following lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m\u00b2 and fludarabine at 30 mg/m\u00b2 administered on days \u20135, \u20134, and \u20133, anito-cel was infused on day 0. Dose escalation was performed at 2 levels: dose level 1 consisted of 100 \u00b1 20% \u00d7 10\u2076 CAR T cells (n = 32), and dose level 2 involved 300 \u00b1 20% \u00d7 10\u2076 CAR T cells (n = 6). An expansion cohort was enrolled at dose level 1. Optional bridging therapy was allowed for patients prior to lymphodepletion.\n\nThe primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), dose-limiting toxicities, and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary end points included best overall response and ORR, assessed per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Exploratory endpoints included MRD negativity, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.\n\nPatient and Disease Characteristics\n\nAt the data cutoff of October 3, 2024, 40 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled in the study, and 38 received at least one dose of anito-cel. All 40 patients underwent leukapheresis and successful manufacture of the CAR T product, and 39 received lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The 38 dosed patients formed the efficacy and safety population.\n\nThe median age of the study population was 66 years (range, 44-76). Over half of the patients (53%) were 65 years of age or older. The majority of participants were male (61%), and most patients identified as White (84%), followed by Black/African American (11%) and Asian (3%).\n\nPatients in the study were heavily pretreated with a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (range, 3-16). All patients were triple refractory, and 68% were penta refractory. High-risk prognostic features were present in 68% of patients, including 63% in the dose-level cohort and 100% in the dose-level 2 cohort. The median time since diagnosis was 6.5 years (range, 1.5-14.9 years).\n\nAdditionally, 76% of patients had undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation, and 68% received bridging therapy prior to anito-cel infusion.\n\nAdditional Efficacy and Safety Findings\n\nThe median time to first response was 1.0 months (range, 0.9-1.9), and the median time to best response and CR/sCR was 2.8 months (range, 0.9-19.4) for each. MRD negativity was achieved at a median of 1.0 months (range, 0.9-5.6). The median duration of response was 29.1 months (95% CI, 15.8-38.0); 39% of patients had ongoing responses at data cutoff.\n\nThe median PFS for all patients was 30.2 months (95% CI, 16.6-NE)and the median PFS for patients who achieved a CR/sCR was 34.3 months (95% CI, 24.2-NE).\n\nThe 12-month PFS rate was 75.9% (95% CI, 58.7%-86.6%), and the 24- and 30-month PFS rates were 56.6% (95% CI, 39.2%-70.8%) and 50.3% (95% CI, 33.0%-65.3%), respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a phase 1 study of a relatively limited number of patients, but to see this response and to see these response rates and ongoing PFS is pretty impressive,\" Bishop said.\n\nAt least one serious AE) was reported in 5.3% of patients. Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 86.8% of patients. The most common grade 3/4 hematologic AEs included neutropenia (86.8%), thrombocytopenia (44.7%), and anemia (55.3%). Non-hematologic grade 3/4 AEs were less frequent and included hypertension (7.9%), pneumonia (7.9%), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (5.3%).\n\n\u201c[This drug was] efficacious and highly safe in this phase 1 study, and again, the primary end point was safety, and the safety profile is actually very impressive for this drug,\u201d Bishop explained.\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in 95% of patients at grade 1 (47%), grade 2 (47%), and grade 3 (3%). No grade 4 or 5 CRS was reported. The median onset of CRS was 2 days (range, 1-12), and the median duration was 5 days (range, 1-9).\n\nICANS occurred in 18% of patients at grade 1 (9%), grade 2 (6%), and grade 3 (3%). No grade 4 or 5 ICANS was reported. The median onset of ICANS was 4.5 days (range, 3-6), and the median duration was 3.5 days (range, 1-9).\n\nAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (5.3%), including 1 case of infection and 1 of hypoxia/heart failure. Tocilizumab and dexamethasone were used to manage CRS in 84% and 58% of patients, respectively.\n\nReference\n\nBishop MR, Rosenblatt J, Binod Dhakal, et al.

            "content": "GraphicPapa/Adobe Stock\n\nDisability and those living with disabilities are often overlooked by psychiatrists and other clinicians despite their prevalence in medical settings. Disability is often ignored or avoided by clinicians or may be overemphasized at the expense of other characteristics or details. For example, a clinician may not ask a patient about a missing limb that may be the result of a traumatic event or focus so much on the missing limb that they forgo screenings for abuse, substance use, or basic health maintenance. These approaches stem in part from societal norms as well as modern medical education. We are conditioned to not discuss disability out of fear of being rude. In training, we learn to anchor diagnoses and treatments based on buzzwords and develop heuristics. These approaches lead to common pitfalls in patient care.\n\nUnderstanding \u2018Disability\u2019\n\nWhat do we mean by disability? The US Centers for Disease Control defines disability as any physical or mental impairment that leads to activity limitation and restricted access to activities.1 Disabilities may be temporary or permanent and may be static or variable over time. Approximately 28% of the United States population has a disability.2 People with disabilities (PWDs) are at higher risk for medical and psychiatric comorbidities both related and unrelated to their disability or chronic illness.3\n\nAs psychiatric clinicians, we must recognize the mental health challenges faced by PWDs and how to address them. PWDs are more likely to experience mental distress, mental disorders, and suicidal behaviors as compared to individuals without disabilities or chronic illnesses.4,5 These disparities are often influenced by negative experiences in medical settings. On the flip side, clinicians have expressed feeling that they or their office were ill equipped to treat PWDs, leading to some clinics refusing to see PWDs.6 This results in the preservation of the current system where PWDs do not have their needs met, and where clinicians do not learn how to adapt to those needs.\n\nWe were inspired to write this piece based on our personal experiences of living with a disability and our goals of providing culturally competent care for the underserved patient population of those who live with a disability. Our experiences as both patients and clinicians grant us a unique perspective to tackle the issue of how PWDs are approached in clinical practice. We do not speak for all living with a disability or chronic illness. Furthermore, we do not intend for the following cases to be all-encompassing for any clinical interaction with a PWD. Rather, we hope that the following may serve as a framework on which clinicians can build their cultural competence.\n\nFor Patients With Physical Disabilities\n\nAs with any condition, it is important to screen for and keep up to date with a patient\u2019s disability or chronic illness. One way to allow patients the ability to discuss this in their own words in an efficient way is to offer a screener on check-in (Box 1).\n\nBox 1. Sample Intake & Screening for Disability/Chronic Illness in Psychiatric Clinic\n\nFurther, ensuring accessibility for PWDs is of paramount importance and requires many considerations (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Accessibility Do\u2019s & Don\u2019ts\n\nIt is also important to note that accessibility starts long before the appointment with the health care professional\u2019s background in clinical education and their comfort with disability and chronic illness. For a more in-depth discussion about accessibility, see the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility website.\n\nCase 1. A Patient With a Physical Disability\n\n\u201cDr Brown\u201d is an early-career psychiatrist who works in an outpatient general psychiatry clinic. He has a new evaluation for a patient referred from neurology. The patient, \u201cMs Olson,\u201d is a woman aged 25 who was born with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). She is being referred for a \u201cdepression evaluation.\u201d Consider Table 2 as you read through this case.\n\nTable 2. Screening and Assessment Considerations\n\nBefore her appointment, Dr Brown asked his staff to confirm if Ms Olson would need any accommodations. She reported that she wore a brace on her leg but would not need any additional space or accommodations. On the intake screening form (Box 1), Ms Olson described her CP as \u201csomething I live with\u201d and \u201cnot really affecting\u201d her mental health. For the additional information question, Ms Olson mentioned she believed her CP \u201cimpacted her personal life.\u201d\n\nThroughout the interview, Ms Olson said she saw several mental health professionals in the past who \u201conly focused on the CP.\u201d \u201cNo one asks about things that matter,\u201d she said. Dr Brown brought up her noted concern about CP impacting her personal life, and Ms Olson disclosed how lower self-esteem had led to increased alcohol consumption and unprotected sex with multiple partners. This led to dysfunction in her life and worsening depression.\n\nDr Brown recommended psychotherapeutic options and provided counseling regarding her mood and alcohol use, along with sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and pregnancy testing which came back negative. Over the course of a year, Ms Olson had improvement in her functioning and depression with minimal pharmacological intervention, thus limiting polypharmacy.\n\nFor Patients With Hearing Losses\n\nAt the Barnes-Jewish Behavioral Health Clinic in Saint Louis, Missouri there is a Deaf Services program that provides culturally competent outpatient mental health care for patients with hearing loss in the region. Our patients\u2019 \u201chearing loss identities\u201d (similar to the concept of preferred pronouns) primarily include Deaf, deaf, and Hard-of-Hearing (HoH) (Table 3), and they use any combination of signed and/or spoken language, with skilled sign language interpreters present as needed.\n\nTable 3. Common Hearing Loss Preferred Identifiers\n\nWhen I first meet patients in the Deaf Services clinic, I fill in a SmartPhrase (Box 2) at the top of each of my notes (with consent from the patient), designed to signify to all other providers that (1) the patient has some form of hearing loss and (2) key points on how to best communicate with and accommodate them. In many cases, patients will appreciate being asked such questions, as it signifies a clinician\u2019s awareness, genuine curiosity, and readiness for accommodations.\n\nBox 2. Sample Epic SmartPhrase Used to Document Pertinent History Regarding Patient\u2019s Hearing Loss\n\nCase 2. A Patient With Hearing Loss\n\n\u201cMike,\u201d a Deaf male aged 31, presents for a routine check-up appointment with \u201cDr Wilson,\u201d a culturally competent physician. At Mike\u2019s proactive request, an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter is present; she sits next to Dr Wilson, ensuring that Mike has a clear view of the signed language modality. Dr Wilson begins by establishing a triangular rapport between herself, the interpreter, and the patient, and asks if Mike would benefit from any additional accommodations or if the set-up of the room could be more optimal. Mike appreciates this, and signs \u201cThank you; actually, it would be nice if you could wear this clear mask I brought, as I speech-read a bit too,\u201d which the interpreter dutifully conveys. (Of note, \u201cspeech-reading\u201d is a more accurate and comprehensive way to refer to the colloquial term \u201clip-reading,\u201d in that speech-reading also considers auditory cues, facial articulations/movements, expressions, and body language.7) Dr Wilson happily complies and asks if Mike and the interpreter are ready to begin.\n\nThroughout the appointment, Dr Wilson optimizes visibility by always ensuring she is facing Mike and maintaining eye contact with him rather than the interpreter. She enunciates her words, without raising her voice or speaking slowly, and uses concise, jargon-free language. She pauses between sentences or phrases to allow the interpreter to relay the information. Afterward, Mike is asked to explain what he understood from Dr Wilson, thus ensuring mutual comprehension. Due to her understanding that effective communication can take more time, Dr Wilson remains patient and encourages Mike to speak up if he feels he missed a concept or if he needs adjustments to the environment or communication style. Overall, the interaction is collaborative, respectful, and accommodative to prioritize Mike\u2019s communication needs.\n\nDr Williams is a psychiatry resident at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Consortium.

Infrastructure costs, geopolitical events, increased vulnerability to natural disasters, and both natural resource and talent shortages will all contribute to ongoing challenges, even as semiconductor supply normalizes.\n\nThe widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and hyper-scale cloud computing is driving much of the surge in chip demand and has also led to shifting fabrication plant (fab) priorities, which will impact sourcing for certain components in 2025 and beyond.\n\nFrank Cavallaro, CEO of A2 Global Electronics, explains that though some elements of market recovery are worth celebrating, buyers should remain cautious and proactively prepare for recovery while developing strategies that help minimize risk.\n\nClick Here to Read\n\nThe True Impact of Blockchain for Global Supply Chains is Yet to be Realized\n\nA Clare Adelgren, global head of blockchain sales and operations at EY, describes, the value proposition of harnessing blockchain technology to transform supply chains is not new. The idea of a distributed ledger, that is transparent and immutable, lends itself to imagining a world where all participants involved in the process of producing, distributing, storing, selling, and consuming a product can view its origin and status in real time. The benefits of such traceability include improved food safety, reduced fraud and optimization in the distribution of scarce resources.\n\nHowever, like any emerging technology, the early years of blockchain witnessed the launch of numerous projects and a wide variety of use cases with a mixed level of success. Some reports conclude that as many as 92% of those early projects in blockchain have failed. While it is debatable if all early technical experiments that don\u2019t turn out as planned should be categorized as failures; it is critical to look at them closely, understand what happened and then build on the learning.\n\nClick Here to Read\n\nFunctional Transformations: The State of Procurement\n\nWe've reached a crossroads. Today, we stand at the intersection of technological innovation, global economic shifts and evolving regulations transitioning the state of procurement in 2024 into a dynamic tapestry of challenges and opportunities. Procurement, once seen as a traditional back-office function, has transformed into a strategic powerhouse that can drive organizational success. Aman Mann, co-founder and CEO at Procurify, says in 2024, the role of procurement is more important than ever, as businesses face complex and dynamic macroeconomic conditions that impact the way they grow and manage their operations.

            "content": "Watch video (above): What's new in Elements 2025?\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements 2025 comes with a handful of new useful features and updates. This \u2018Photoshop lite\u2019 offering from Adobe can\u2019t compete with its bigger brother, Photoshop CC but it has long been a useful photo editor in its own right. In this project, we\u2019ll take our steam train here on a tour of the new features.\n\nWe often see a trickle-down of tools from Photoshop CC to Elements, and this time we are treated to the AI-powered Remove tool, a brush that lets you get rid of unwanted details. In our tests, it\u2019s good when the offending object is against a fairly uniform backdrop, but \u2013 like many automated tools \u2013 it struggles with cluttered details, and it\u2019s not as good as the identically named tool in Photoshop CC (which seems to employ more advanced AI).\n\nThere\u2019s a raft of new \u2018Guided Edits\u2019. These step-by-step guides take you through common projects for all manner of effects; some good, some bad. Here we have a new Combine Photos Guided Edit, a basic compositing workflow that gives rather basic results. There\u2019s also a feature for color changing and, best of all, a Depth Blur filter that applies automated depth-of-field effects.\n\nWith its gentle learning curve and simple interface, Elements will tick a lot of boxes for those who want to have a bit of fun with their images. Some may find it rather cutesy and basic, but delve deeper into the layers-based workflow and there\u2019s plenty of potential for creative projects.\n\nIf you'd like to follow along with the steps below download the start images here, or open up one of your own images to get started and try out the latest features of Elements 2025.\n\n1. Remove objects\n\nThe new Remove Tool makes it a walk in the park to remove distracting elements from your frames (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nIf you have an object or person you want to get rid of, grab the new Remove tool from the toolbar, paint around the area and Elements will generate a fill for you. Here we\u2019ve used it to remove distracting posts and details in the background. There\u2019s also a Guided Edit that takes you through the steps.\n\n2. Change colors\n\nA new 'Change Object Color' command makes it even easier to swap colors within your photos (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nYou can quickly change the colours of objects with a handy new command. Go to Enhance > Change Object Colour. Use a Selection tool to isolate an area then change the colours within. The selection tools let you tidy edges by adding or subtracting, and a slider allows you to alter the brightness of the colour.\n\n3. Adjust depth\n\nOf course Elements doesn't miss out on some new AI improvements too, here the Depth Blur filter was used to give the background a realistic blur (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nThe new Depth Blur filter employs AI to alter the depth of your image. It can recognise the fore-, mid- and background and apply blur to whichever you like. Go to Filter > Blur > Depth Blur, click the preview box on the part you want to remain \u2018in-focus\u2019 then fine-tune by adjusting the blur strength and focal range.\n\n4. Combine pictures\n\nPhotoshop Elements features 'Guided' edits to walk you through more involved edits, such as the Combine Photos edit pictured here (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nA new Guided Edit takes you through the steps to combine photos. First open the images that you want to combine, then go to the Guided interface and choose Combine Photos. Work through the steps by first importing then extracting and positioning objects, before finally matching the tones.\n\n5. Advanced editing\n\nThe Advanced workspace found in the top bar is more akin to the full version of Photoshop CC where you're let off the reigns to edit freely (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nThe real strength in Elements can be found in the Advanced interface. Here, with a few simple layer skills, you can fine-tune your effects and polish off your composites. Here we can add adjustment layers to colour and tone our images to match one another more seamlessly.\n\n6. Moving overlays\n\nOne new addition I was really excited about was the Moving Elements feature which makes it possible to add moving elements, like falling snow to your pictures and then export it as a GIF file. (Image credit: James Paterson)\n\nAnother fun new feature in Elements 2025 is the Moving Elements feature. Go to Enhance > Moving Overlays (merge layers first with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E) and choose from an array of motion effects like the falling snow here, then export a fun GIF. You also get Moving Elements and Photos to play with.\n\nIf you enjoyed this tutorial but want a bit more power from your laptop, why not look at the best photo-editing laptops? If you're really keen to improve your skills further then online photography courses could be the way to go.",

In the BMS-986253 arm, the complete response (CR), partial response, stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) rates were 8.1%, 6.5%, 19.4%, and 50.0%, respectively. These respective rates were 1.7%, 10.0%, 31.7%, and 36.7% in the control arm.\n\nNo patients in either arm had SD for more than 6 months. In the BMS-986253 group, 4.8% of patients had a best response of non-CR/non-PD, and response was unable to be determined in 11.3% of patients. In the control arm, 1.7% of patients had a best response of non-CR/non-PD, 13.3% were unable to be evaluated for response, and best response was not reported in 5.0% of patients.\n\n\u201cThese results further support the use of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with melanoma who progress on anti\u2013PD-[L]1 monotherapy,\u201d lead study author Matteo Simonelli, MD, of the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital Humanitas University in Milan, Italy, said in a presentation of the data.\n\nCA027-002 Overview\n\nPart 2 of CA027-002 included patients at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed, unresectable, stage III or IV melanoma whose disease progressed on or after anti\u2013PD-(L)1 therapy. Prior anti\u2013PD-(L)1 therapy needed to be the most recent line of treatment. Patients with BRAF V600E\u2013mutated and wild-type disease were allowed to enroll, and patients needed to have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. No prior anti\u2013CTLA-4 therapy was allowed.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 3600 mg of BMS-986253 once every 2 weeks plus 1 mg/kg of nivolumab once every 3 weeks and 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab once every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks, followed by 3600 mg of BMS-986253 once every 2 weeks plus 480 mg of nivolumab once every 4 weeks; or placebo plus the same regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab for the first 12 weeks, followed by placebo plus 480 mg of nivolumab once every 4 weeks.\n\nStratification factors included serum IL-8 levels (>10 pg/mL vs \u226410 pg/mL), BRAF V600E status (mutated vs wild-type), and peripheral lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (>upper limit of normal [ULN] vs \u2264ULN).\n\nBlinded independent central review\u2013assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria served as the trial\u2019s primary end point. Secondary end points included PFS and safety.\n\nThe median age was 64.0 years in the experimental arm vs 63.5 years in the control arm. The majority of patients were male (BMS-986253 arm, 64.5%; placebo arm, 71.7%), White (90.3%; 88.3%), not Hispanic or Latino (67.7%; 68.3%), from Europe (75.8%; 56.7%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (80.6%; 83.3%), had LDH levels no higher than the ULN (62.9%; 61.7%), did not harbor BRAF V600E mutations (79.0%; 78.3%), and did not have brain metastases (96.8%; 93.3%).\n\nAdditional Efficacy and Safety Data\n\nThe median time to response was 1.9 months in the BMS-986253 arm vs 2.6 months in the placebo arm. The median duration of response was not applicable (NA; 95% CI, 4.07-NA; range, 4.1-18.5) in the BMS-986253 arm vs NA (95% CI, 5.29-NA; range, 4.6-15.5) in the placebo arm.\n\nThe median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.8) in the BMS-986253 group vs 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.7) in the placebo group (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61-1.45; P = .74). In the BMS-986253 arm, the 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 24% and 15%, respectively. These respective rates in the placebo arm were 22% and 12%.\n\nRegarding safety, any-grade treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) occurred in 95.2% of patients in the BMS-986253 arm vs 87.7% of patients in the control arm. The rates of grade 3/4 TRAEs were 46.8% and 52.6%, respectively. TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 22.6% of patients in the BMS-986253 group vs 24.6% of patients in the placebo group. The rates of serious TRAEs were 38.7% and 40.4%, respectively.\n\nThe most common grade 3/4 TRAEs included diarrhea (BMS-986253 arm, 9.7%; placebo arm, 15.8%), colitis (6.5%; 12.3%), increased alanine aminotransferase levels (8.1%; 5.3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase levels (4.8%; 5.3%), and increased lipase levels (6.5%; 3.5%).\n\nOne grade 5 TRAE was reported in each arm. One patient in the experimental arm had grade 5 renal failure, and 1 patient in the placebo arm had grade 5 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\n\nDisclosures: Dr Simonelli reported serving as an advisory board member for Incyte, Cytovia, and GSK; being an invited speaker for GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb; serving on a data monitoring committee for Sanofi; serving as a steering committee member for Celgene and Bristol Myers Squibb; and receiving travel grants from Roche, Sanofi, and Pfizer.\n\nReference\n\nSimonelli M, Butler MO, Ascierto PA, et al.

            "content": "Spread the love\n\nI\u2019ve had an Adobe subscription for over 10 years now, possibly close to 15. Even though I\u2019ve been more of a Capture One user for the last 3 years for my photography editing, I still maintain my Adobe Photography Plan to use Lightroom mobile and Adobe Photoshop. While I\u2019ve been fairly impressed with the additions and improvements they\u2019ve brought to the table for the most part of the last decade, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a big fan of their love affair with AI and everything to do with it. With the announcement of the price increase that\u2019s going to hit all monthly payment plan subscribers in 2025, I might just pull the plug on Adobe altogether. Unless they decide to give some of us a separate, non-AI-priced plan.\n\nWhat Gives Adobe?\n\nI believe the price of all their Creative Cloud plans is about to increase in some countries at the start of 2025 and in others around March this year. But let\u2019s talk specifically about the Photography Plan (20 GB). If you head to the FAQ page about Creative Cloud Photography (20GB) pricing changes and click on theWhy is the price of my Creative Cloud Photography plan (20GB) changing question, you\u2019re presented with this:\n\n\u201cWe are committed to continually improving our plans to meet the needs of all creative users, from enthusiasts to professionals. The Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan has embraced the latest advancements in digital imaging and continues to be a powerful solution for editing, organizing, storing, and sharing images for anyone interested in photography. Since its launch over a decade ago, the Photography plan (20GB) has maintained its competitive pricing, all the while expanding to include highly sought-after apps like Lightroom for mobile, Photoshop for iPad and the web, among others. Recent additions to your membership include tools capabilities like Select Subject, Remove Background, and the Contextual Task Bar in Photoshop and Lens Blur, Denoise, and hundreds of Premium Presets in Lightroom and Lightroom Classic. In addition, we are committed to supporting photographers and continuing to innovate across our platform, including Lightroom Classic. \u201c\n\nTo me, this just sounds like a fancy way of Adobe saying \u2013 Hey folks, we\u2019ve gotten too deep into AI without realizing how expensive it would be. Since we have no way of slowing it down without burning up our cash reserves, we\u2019ve decided to pass on those costs to you. We realize you\u2019ve been long-time users of us now, so we know you don\u2019t really have another alternative to start looking for at such short notice. Some of you might leave since you can\u2019t pay the annual fee upfront or afford the monthly increase. We can hardly be bothered as we need more cash to come up with more and more AI-related gimmicks that photographers like you will hardly ever use.\n\nI\u2019d argue this increase is mostly coming from all the generative AI investments for Adobe Firefly. But speak to serious photographers who use Lightroom and Photoshop for editing their photos, and I\u2019d be willing to wager that most of them don\u2019t need any of the generative tools that Adobe wants to sell to us via this price increase.\n\nDo I have a personal grudge against Adobe \u2013 no.\n\nAm I darn peeved off over this increase in the monthly plan \u2013 damn right I am.\n\nWhat has been a convenient payment method for over 10 years now has me contemplating between finding how to pay upfront for a year or canceling my plan altogether and just doing all my edits on a desktop. This one change alone isn\u2019t really what\u2019s worrying; it\u2019s a series of moves by Adobe over the last few years that have had a lot of us worried about whether they truly value their customers over their shareholders. Here are some of the pieces we\u2019ve penned in recent years that you should read if you have similar concerns about them:\n\nIs There A Solution?\n\nFor photographers, I think Adobe\u2019s AI capabilities and features peaked around October 2022 when their desktop version (non-Classic) got a load of AI tools. These were great additions because they weren\u2019t generative AI nonsense. They genuinely could help photographers edit their photographs faster and more seamlessly get their work out. To me, this was Adobe bringing out a version upgrade with photographers in mind. The majority of genuine photographers like you and me don\u2019t give two hoots about any generative AI capabilities that Adobe has now or has in mind for the years ahead. Stuff like this is why I don\u2019t really care about Skylum\u2018s software and its sky replacement capabilities, as good or not they might be. So why are we now having to pay for Adobe\u2019s incessant desire to swim in the questionably unethical ocean that is AI?\n\nGive Me A Non-Generative AI Photography (20 GB) Plan\n\nI would prefer to continue paying Adobe USD 9.99 monthly, just as I have been doing for the most part of my professional career. I definitely don\u2019t want to have to pay over 50% more at USD 14.99 just to continue paying monthly instead of an upfront annual fee. What could make a lot of us photographers happy is if Adobe continued to allow us to keep this plan at 9.99 a month and exclude all the generative AI features they claim to so generously be adding for our benefit. Leave out the Generative Remove AI feature which looks like it was introduced to counter what Samsung and Google introduced in their phones (allowing you to remove your ex from a photograph). Take away the Adaptive Presets for Portraits, too, if you must. I can live without the Quick Actions. And I\u2019m certain later this year, you\u2019ll say that I can add butterflies to the skies in my photos and turn a still photo into a cinemagraph with one click.\n\nSeriously, skip all the generative AI features and don\u2019t make me pay another USD 60 a year to have to continue paying you monthly. I\u2019m a professional, and this unwanted increase seriously irks me. Imagine what all the amateurs out there must feel like at the moment. Why inadvertently urge them to move away from Adobe, or worse, have them consider software piracy as a means to get their editing done?\n\nHonestly, if Capture One brings out their mobile app to Android this year, I probably won\u2019t have any more reason to stay on this Adobe plan anymore.",

There's no debate over the reason for the decline: a poorly received set of fourth-quarter earnings and guidance. However, there is a substantial debate around the future direction of its earnings and cash flow due to its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAdobe's earnings and guidance\n\nAdobe is a software company that offers digital media solutions to help creatives (photographers, video editors, and game developers) create and publish content. Its most important product is Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe also sells \"digital experience\" solutions that help users measure, monitor, and optimize customer experiences.\n\nWith a gross margin of 89%, an adjusted operating margin of 46.6%, a free cash flow (FCF) margin of 36.6%, 13% year-over-year growth in digital media average recurring revenue (ARR) in 2024, and a scalable business model, there's nothing wrong with Adobe's metrics.\n\nThere's also nothing wrong with Adobe's valuation on a backward-looking basis. With almost $7.9 billion in FCF generated in 2024, Adobe trades on 24.6 times 2024 FCF. That's not expensive for a company with such a scalable business model, whereby ARR from subscriptions drops down into cash flow.\n\nWhat about Adobe's guidance?\n\nThat said, investors care more about where a company and its stock are heading than where they came from. Adobe's stock was met with several price target reductions from Wall Street analysts disappointed with the 2025 guidance, which called for 11% growth in digital media ARR. In a nutshell, analysts expect more growth from Adobe on the assumption that it would increasingly monetize its growing AI solutions, which are being integrated into its solutions.\n\nThe AI debate around Adobe\n\nOne side of the argument is that Adobe should better monetize its solution, Firefly, which generates AI for creatives. From this point of view, Adobe has a significant growth opportunity in the pricing of its AI applications.\n\nHowever, using Firefly's online AI art generator is currently free (although there is pricing for premium options) as management is trying to encourage adoption of the solutions. That position is disappointing some investors.\n\nOn the other hand, the competition in the creative space is fierce, and if Adobe aggressively prices its AI solutions, it may lose subscribers. There's also the possibility that the AI tools used to create content could reduce the need for creative personnel at Adobe's key customers, implying less demand for its software. It's an ongoing debate that won't be resolved anytime soon. Still, there was enough disappointment around the guidance to lower the stock in December.",

Analysts now see a potential upside of nearly 10%, sparking conversations about whether this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors.\n\nInstitutional players are keeping one eye on the horizon. Recent insider sales\u2014totaling nearly $1.7 million\u2014might raise an eyebrow, but the bigger picture shows Adobe's fundamentals holding steady. Its net margin stands tall at 25.85%, and return on equity of as much as 45.22%.

Patients administered tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab (Imfinzi) and paclitaxel (n = 12) experienced a confirmed ORR of 8%, and those given tremelimumab alone (n = 12) had a confirmed ORR of 8%.\n\nThe median overall survival (OS) was 16.1 months (95% CI, 8.5-not applicable [NA]) in the tremelimumab/paclitaxel arm, 14.5 months (95% CI, 9.4-NA) in the tremelimumab/durvalumab/paclitaxel arm, and 8.3 months (95% CI, 4.7-NA) in the tremelimumab arm.\n\n\u201cNovel anticancer therapies combined with anti\u2013CTLA-4 [therapy] may provide a more optimal combination for tumor response and durability of response in the therapy-refractory [urothelial cancer] population,\u201d lead study author Hamza Ali, an MD/PhD student at the Netherland Cancer Institute, said in a presentation of the data.\n\nICRA Rationale and Overview\n\nDuring his presentation, Ali explained that patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who experience disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.\n\nICRA was a single-center trial conducted at the Netherlands Cancer Institute where investigators enrolled patients at least 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic or unresectable urothelial carcinoma.2 Ineligibility for cisplatin-based chemotherapy or prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy was required. Patients also needed to have prior treatment with anti\u2013PD-(L)1 therapy.\n\nOther key inclusion criteria included a World Health Organization performance status of 0 or 1; a body weight of more than 30 kg; and adequate organ and bone marrow function.\n\nDuring the safety run-in portion of the study, patients were assigned to 1 of 5 arms, which each included 3 patients:1,2\n\nArm 1: 75 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6, then once every 12 weeks until week 45, plus 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm 2: 225 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6, then once every 12 weeks until week 45, plus 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm 3: 750 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6, then once every 12 weeks until week 45, plus 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm 4: 75 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 2 to 5 plus 1500 mg of durvalumab on day 1 of cycles 1 to 12, then once every 4 weeks until week 49, and 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm 5: 300 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycle 2 plus 1500 mg of durvalumab on day 1 of cycles 1 to 12, then once every 4 weeks until week 49, and 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nThe main study included 3 arms:\n\nArm A: 750 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6, then once every 12 weeks until week 45, plus 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm B: 300 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycle 2 plus 1500 mg of durvalumab on day 1 of cycles 1 to 12, then once every 4 weeks until week 49, and 70 mg/m2 of paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 to 6\n\nArm C: 750 mg of tremelimumab on day 1 of cycles 1 to 12, then every 4 weeks until week 49\n\nIn the main study, the arms were intended to include 12 patients each, and expansion to 20 patients was permitted in arms where at least 2 responses were observed.1\n\nORR served as the trial\u2019s primary end point.2 Secondary end points included safety, OS, progression-free survival, and duration of response.\n\nTranslational Analysis Findings\n\nDuring the 2024 ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress, investigators also presented findings from a translational analysis, which showed that high baseline IFN-\u03b3 (P = .021) and CD8 (P = .064) signatures were associated with durable clinical benefit.1\n\nAli explained that durable responses were correlated with higher inflammatory signature scores.\n\n\u201c[Transcriptional data suggest that] anti\u2013CTLA-4 [therapy] may still induce inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, even in patients who have already [experienced disease progression] on anti\u2013PD-[L]1 immunotherapy,\u201d Ali concluded.\n\nDisclosures: Ali did not disclose any interests.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "The procure-to-pay (P2P) process connects procurement activities with payment processes to streamline operations and enhance vendor relationships. In 2025, the P2P process is undergoing rapid transformation driven by technology, sustainability goals and so much more. Shaz Khan, CEO at Vroozi, lists 5 key trends in the space that will shape the outlook in procurement moving forward:\n\n1. Global e-invoice mandates will reshape compliance landscape. \"While the U.S. has fewer requirements today, mandatory e-invoicing success in Europe and Latin America signals wider adoption. With Australia and New Zealand phasing in these mandates, businesses face new urgency to adapt their processes,\" explains Khan.\n\n2. Generative AI will bring new intelligence to procurement workflows. \"AI capabilities now enable teams to automate supplier communications, contract analysis, and compliance monitoring. Contextual AI assistants provide personalized guidance based on user permissions and process context \u2013 for example, when a new employee joins, the assistant helps them order equipment like their Mac or PC, simplifying complex procurement steps while maintaining compliance protocols,\" says Khan. \"This improved automation helps organizations increase processing speed while reducing errors.\"\n\n3. Straight-through processing will require stronger fraud controls. As invoice processing automation kicks off, so do fraud attempts. \"While technology enables faster validation and payment, organizations must implement advanced detection systems that can spot anomalies, verify legitimacy, and prevent fraudulent invoices from entering the payment stream. Proper controls and verification processes are essential as companies automate their accounts payable workflows,\" says Khan.\n\n4. Cross-departmental spend and supply chain visibility will become mission-critical. Khan explains, \"As companies expand into new markets, maintaining consistent control over procurement across locations requires standardized operations and real-time visibility into spending patterns.\"\n\n5. Cross-platform integration is now essential for procurement systems. Organizations are moving away from single-vendor ERP solutions toward flexible, interconnected platforms that serve specific business needs and new employees can now select and access their preferred work applications through personalized portals, explains Khan, with immediate provisioning and seamless data flow between systems. \"This shift toward rapid integration capabilities helps companies adapt quickly while maintaining consistent processes and controls across their technology ecosystem,\" describes Khan.\n\nIt's clear that the future of P2P is marked by innovation and adaptation to emerging challenges. By embracing these 5 points, organizations can create resilient, efficient and transparent P2P processes that drive value in procurement.",

In reviewing the best graphic design software, we've tested out everything from brushes and filters to assets and AI tools. We also looked at performance and pricing to find the best free software for graphic design, and those offering excellent value for money.\n\nThe best graphic design software of 2025 in full:\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best graphic design software on our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\n\nBest graphic design software overall\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nPhotoshop is a byword for graphic design these days. Adobe\u2019s photo and design software dominates the industry - and with good reason. Setting the gold standard for design work and photo editing, its toolkit is bursting with features that even the best Photoshop alternatives struggle to match.\n\nWhen we reviewed the top tool, we found it offered best-in-class color management, layer handling, and selection tools, with AI automating a raft of effects from cleaning up images to object removal. After reviewing the tool, we ultimately felt that from subject selection to object removal, Adobe\u2019s Firefly and Sensei models offer impressive performance. And although the results aren't always perfect straight off the bat, especially with uncanny neural filters, the software still provides excellent value.\n\nWhile Photoshop isn\u2019t hard to learn, there is a slight learning curve that may overwhelm new users. Stick with it though, and you\u2019ll be more than rewarded with high-quality, high-res results. It also means you\u2019ll be familiar with other Adobe apps in the creative toolstack, since they largely follow the same interface.\n\nWhether you choose to have Adobe Photoshop on its own, or as part of Creative Cloud All App, you can only get it through an ongoing subscription. The only difference is the price of entry, and the fact All Apps grants you access to over 20 of Adobe\u2019s professional apps, which seamlessly integrate with each other.\n\nRead our full Adobe Photoshop review .\n\nBest subscription-free graphic design software\n\n(Image credit: Serif)\n\n2. Affinity Designer 2 An outstanding alternative to Adobe's apps Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Windows, macOS, iPadOS Plan: Perpetual license Today's Best Deals View at Serif Europe US Reasons to buy + Multi-platform + One-off price, no subscriptions + Outstanding new tools + Easy to use Reasons to avoid - No auto-save on Mac - Not quite as many tools as Illustrator\n\nSerif Affinity Designer 2 is primarily a vector-based graphic design software for Mac and Windows, although it does also possess a powerful array of raster-type tools as well.\n\nPrevious updates primarily focused on the vector side of designer, introducing powerful and highly requested features such as a Shape Builder, and various Warp tools, among many others. The latest revisions for version 2.5 include the inclusion of variable fonts, the ability to alter the stroke\u2019s width and position by dragging points along it, and you can even create QR codes.\n\nWe were quite surprised at how easy and intuitive such powerful features were to use, adding flexibility and versatility to an already impressive app.\n\nWe would argue that Designer has enough tools in its arsenal to be considered a potential Adobe Illustrator alternative, even if its subscription-free, value-for-money price tag might make you think otherwise.\n\nRead our full Affinity Designer 2 review.\n\nBest free graphic design software\n\n(Image credit: Canva)\n\nCanva is an ideal solution for designers and non-designers creating branded assets - an impressively easy-to-use graphic design app that largely relies on dragging, dropping, and resizing vector graphics.\n\nThe beauty of Canva is in its simple execution. Whether you\u2019re a skilled artist or you\u2019ve never opened Photoshop in your life, you have the tools to create incredibly professional-looking graphics to boost your online presence, promote your brand, and more. There are plenty of templates for fast creation that can be fully customized to fit your branding. Little wonder it\u2019s become a firm favorite in marketing departments where the demand to create a lot of high-end visual content fast is a necessity.\n\nBut this is as much a content marketing tool as it is a design app, and under the hood you\u2019ll find a simple video maker (see our Canva Video review ), website builder (see our Canva Website Builder review ) and a PDF editor (see our Canva PDF Editor review ). Each is a delight to use - so long as you temper expectations, this is graphic design streamlined, so it lacks advanced tools for precise or very complex designs.\n\nUse the left-hand sidebar to find the assets you want - from illustrations to stock photos and videos, or upload your own media. Brand-conscious organizations may want to opt for the Canva Pro subscription, which unlocks the Brand Kit, ensuring design consistency across all creations.\n\nRead our full Canva review .\n\nBest graphic design software for illustrators\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nAdobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program that's stable in use and absolutely packed with features for graphic design work at all levels.\n\nWhile the latest version doesn't deliver any major updates, we were impressed with the range of small improvements Adobe has made here. These include being able to identify and edit fonts in any image, create realistic mockups on template 3D objects, and work with projects online. The excellent Firefly forces its way into the company's entire software portfolio. During our own tests, we found the AI was well-integrated into Illustrator. While your mileage may vary, in our exploration of the software, we found the results to be pretty impressive.\n\nLike most Adobe apps, Illustrator is available via a standalone subscription, but also comes bundled into the Creative Cloud All Apps packages. That's a useful option if you're also using Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, or more.\n\nRead our full Adobe Illustrator review.\n\nBest graphic design software for beginners\n\n(Image credit: CorelDRAW)\n\nCorelDRAW is part of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite - a software bundle rather than a single application.\n\nThe package includes Photo-Paint for photo manipulation, AfterShot to handle RAW files, PowerTRACE to convert bitmap images into vectors, and FontManager for organizing the text styles you do actually use.\n\nThe main star, of course, is CorelDRAW itself, which isn't just a vector-drawing package but also includes a desktop publishing feature as well, so you can design projects with a multi-page layout.\n\nThe latest version includes a number of improvements, such as pixel-based brushes and creative templates, streamlined fonts and non-destructive effects workflows. In addition to these, is the ability to easily search through your images as thumbnails. Another plus is that after a break it has returned to the Mac with a fully functional version.\n\nOverall, the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite offers a veteran range of software that remains very up-to-date, and widening its use to Apple users as well as Windows can only be a plus.\n\nRead our full CorelDRAW review.\n\nBest online vector editor\n\n(Image credit: CorelDRAW)\n\n6. Corel Vector Best online vector editor Specifications Operating system: Web Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals Check Amazon VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Online + Easy to learn Reasons to avoid - Complex designs make it slow - Top-end resolutions only available to Pro subscribers\n\nSince it has rebranded itself from Gravit Designer Pro, Corel Vector has discarded its native software and has gone fully online. Due to the complexity of vector illustrations, most software for creating them is locally installed, but this is the direction Corel Vector has taken (not unlike Adobe Illustrator which also offers an online option).\n\nThe cloud-based version runs from any browser and can automatically save to both online and to your local storage. You don\u2019t even need to always be online to use it, and can work for up to 15 days offline should you happen to be in an area with bad internet coverage.\n\nWhen we reviewed this service as Gravit, we found its online version could get slow with complex designs. We have not had a chance to test it since the rebranding. What\u2019s regretful is that in addition to mothballing the local versions, it seems there is no longer a limited free version either. You can however take advantage of a 15-day free trial if you\u2019d like to give Corel Vector a try. There are plenty of impressive examples designers have created using this service which proves it can be very effective at some jobs.\n\nBest free Adobe Illustrator alternative\n\n(Image credit: Inkscape)\n\n7. Inkscape Best free Adobe Illustrator alternative Our expert review: Specifications Operating system: Windows, macOS Plan: Free Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Free + On Windows, Linux and Mac + Powerful vector illustration tool Reasons to avoid - Can be slow at times - Vector-focus\n\nMost business people often shy away from free software for valid reasons, but Inkscape is certainly worth looking at before you commit to buying CorelDRAW or one of a myriad of Adobe subscriptions.\n\nInkscape is a vector design tool that offers broad file support, extensive text manipulation, and both Bezier and Spiro curve types. It also has an extension model that allows new features to be easily installed, and there are some amazing ones available.\n\nThe only reservations we have are that even on a powerful PC, this software can be slow at times when a complicated process involves rendering.\n\nAs a GPL-licensed app, along with Windows, Linux, and Apple Mac versions, you can also download the source code and compile it for whatever version of Linux you are using.\n\nRead our full Inkscape review.\n\nBest graphic design software for UI\n\n(Image credit: Sketch)\n\n8. Sketch Create memorable user interfaces Specifications Operating system: macOS Plan: Subscription Today's Best Deals VISIT SITE Reasons to buy + Easy to learn + Regular updates + Great for mockups and prototyping Reasons to avoid - Mac only - UI design focus\n\nRather than the scatter-gun approach of other applications, the creators of Sketch built a tool to address a relatively narrow requirement.\n\nSketch is focused on screen design, specifically creating the icons and interface elements for websites and applications. And, as the software is exclusively available for the Apple Mac, most designers working on iPhone, iPad and macOS applications are going to find it useful.\n\nThat said, it can be used more generally, but its strength is creating slick user interfaces. Sketch is one of the best UI tools in the market and it offers a brilliant, minimalist user experience with its intuitive keyboard shortcuts and smooth running. It also boasts a vast library of Sketch Plugins and is quite feature-rich.\n\nSketch is available for a single-user license. However, licenses for multiple devices are available.\n\nBest graphic design software for Windows\n\n(Image credit: Xara)\n\n9. Xara Designer Pro X A Windows-exclusive design app Specifications Operating system: Windows Plan: Perpetual license Today's Best Deals View at Walmart View at Amazon (Download) View at Amazon (Download) Reasons to buy + Affordable + Extensive templates + Versatile + Great for designing page layouts Reasons to avoid - Windows only\n\nThe company behind Xara started out on the Atari ST and Acorn Archimedes computers in the 1980s, before focusing its efforts on the PC when Windows came along.\n\nThe latest version of Xara Designer Pro X is a comprehensive design tool that can work with both bitmaps and vectors with equal aplomb. That means it can handle DTP (desktop publishing), graphic design, illustration and photo manipulation tasks in a single tool.\n\nFor those wanting to mock something up rapidly, a license gives you access to over a million archive photos and illustrations to incorporate, along with hundreds of template layouts and thousands of design elements.\n\nBest graphic design software: FAQs\n\nWhat is graphic design software? Graphic design is the creation and arrangement of visuals in a project to convey ideas or messages. Graphic design tools or software enable users to work on various aspects of design \u2014 from vector graphics and photo manipulation to color editing, color correction, and much more.\n\nWhat is vector Illustration? We put the question to Klaus Vossen, Senior Product Manager for CorelDraw . So what exactly is a vector and vector illustration and how does it differ from a bitmap. Let\u2019s start with Vector vs. Bitmap. Bitmaps, also known as raster images, are created using pixels, which are small dots of color. Think photographs! And while bitmap images are essential to any design workflow, it\u2019s important to know that they can vary tremendously in terms of size and image quality \u2013 unfortunately running the risk of becoming blurry when enlarged. On the other hand, vector images are made up of points, lines, and shapes that can be edited to precise detail, and because they\u2019re based on mathematical equations they can be scaled indefinitely to any size. Extremely versatile, a single vector image, let\u2019s say a logo, can be printed anywhere from the corner of an envelope to a roadside billboard \u2013 all using the same original file. So now that we know what a vector file is, it\u2019s easy to understand why they\u2019re so important to a graphics workflow. And while there are plenty of apps that offer vector illustration tools, if you want professional results with high-quality output, you need professional software.\n\nWhat's the difference between vector and raster? Vector and raster graphics are both essential for digital designers, artists, and creatives - but what are the differences between the two? Vector graphics are 'resolution independent'. This means the graphics, built from lines, points, and curves, use mathematical equations to let you resize vector graphics without seeing a drop in quality. Raster graphics are made from pixels, which means they can look good at their intended size, but scaling up the image and maintaining quality isn't possible. There are pros and cons to using both. We explore the differences in our guide to vector vs. raster. For a deeper dive into vectors, see vector graphics explained.\n\nHow to choose the best graphic design software\n\nWhen deciding which of the best graphic design software to download and use, first consider how serious and professional you need the software to be.\n\nIf you are only looking to make simple designs and files then you have the option to be less fussy about which program you use.\n\nHowever, if you plan to develop anything for professional printing, it may be better to aim for one of the higher range and more expensive programs on our list.\n\nYou'll also want to consider the capabilities of your computer. Most vector editors and design apps aren't especially resource-intensive, but you will want one with a color-accurate screen and good graphics to ensure your on-screen artwork precisely matches the final version. Alternatively, if you prefer to work on the go, the best drawing tablets and the best laptops for drawing and digital art may better suit your creative workflow.\n\nFor more software ideas, we've also tested out the best free Adobe Illustrator vector alternatives.\n\nHow we test the best graphic design software\n\nWe've tested a range of graphic design apps, including the best desktop publishing software, best logo makers, and the best free logo makers.\n\nTo test for the best graphic design software, we first set up an account with a range of different software platforms, either as a download or as an online service. We then tested it using a handful of images to see how the software could be used for the editing and development of each image.\n\nThe aim was to push each software platform to see whether it could simply and easily not just edit a range of content types but also do so faithfully and consistently without introducing formatting issues or similar problems that would make them useless for printing purposes.\n\nWe tested the best Adobe InDesign alternatives - here's what we recommend for creative magazine making\n\nGet in touch\n\nWant to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

            "content": "Adobe has been one of the biggest creative brands to embrace the potential of generative AI with Adobe Firefly, and in doing so has divided the creator community.\n\nBut Adobe's approach to including AI features in Photoshop and other software has been nuanced, and it's been done in tandem with clear initiatives designed to protect artists and copyrights. The idea is to add creator-first AI tools to its software, as well as develop new AI-first tools, like Adobe Project Concept AI while setting up tools to protect ownership.\n\nWhat is clear is generative AI is here to stay, and many artists are using it in their workflows, like digital artist Guillermo Flores Pacheco who creates detailed, colourful collages using Firefly with his regular methods. But as detailed in our digital arts trends of 2025 article there are new laws and legal cases in the horizon that could curtail how AI is used and add copyright protections for artists.\n\nIn fairness to Adobe, it's ahead of the pack when it comes to its approach to protecting artists, and while not always perfect, the direction of travel is welcome. With initiatives like Adobe Content Credentials and Project Know How that track ownership and make clear what is and isn't AI generated Adobe already has more safeguards in place than other creative app developers.\n\nBelow Alexandru Costin, Vice President of Generative AI and Sensei at Adobe, explains in detail the challenges facing artists, how AI can be used safely, what the benefits can be, and how Adobe is putting place the tools to protect copyrights in the AI era.\n\n(Image credit: Guillermo Flores Pacheco)\n\nCB: What does the future look like for AI, art and copyright? AC: Generative AI is already transforming the creative process, giving creators tools to push boundaries, work more efficiently, and realise their visions faster than ever. At Adobe, we believe AI is here to support and enhance human creativity, not replace it, by enabling artists to create their best work while ensuring they get full credit for it. AI has the potential to democratise creativity, putting powerful tools in the hands of everyone, from professionals to small business owners, the world\u2019s largest enterprises and students. Take Adobe Express: its AI-powered features make it easy to adapt content for different channels, seamlessly apply branding, and even rewrite or translate copy in seconds. However, as AI evolves, so do its challenges, especially around regulation, transparency, and intellectual property. Safeguards are critical to ensure that people trust AI and that creators feel their work is protected. Looking ahead, we\u2019re committed to working with policymakers, creators, and the broader community to ensure AI accelerates creativity while safeguarding intellectual property and fostering trust.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nCB: How does Adobe decide on the Gen AI Firefly features it integrates into its products? Does a new innovation need to deliver a real-world use case? Alexandru Costin: Our products touch billions of people, which means the decisions about what features we integrate into our products and how we do this matter to us. Our core mission has always revolved around empowering individuals and businesses to unleash their creative potential. Key to this is focusing on generative AI features that empower them to be more creative and productive. Our family of Adobe Firefly models have the power to augment and amplify human ingenuity by giving people new playgrounds for ideation and exploration. Firefly empowers people to realise their creative visions \u2013 even the most fantastical or surreal ones \u2013 with greater speed, agility, and precision. At the same time, innovative features integrated into Adobe products are also reducing \u2018busy work\u2019, freeing creatives from tedious or time-consuming tasks like resizing images and localising outputs. Once such example is IBM\u2019s recent Let\u2019s Create brand campaign where Firefly was used to generate 200 assets and over 1,000 marketing variations for the campaign in a matter of minutes. It is equally important that we also consider how we innovate. Responsible innovation is our top priority whenever we launch a new AI feature. Our AI Ethics principles rooted in accountability, responsibility, and transparency guide us in carefully evaluating every feature before it reaches our users. For example, multi-layered impact assessments are key to spotting features that might unintentionally perpetuate harmful biases or stereotypes. That said, we know the job doesn\u2019t end once a feature is live, so we\u2019ve set up ways for users to share feedback, especially if they notice outputs that feel off or biased. This collaboration helps us fix things quickly and continue improving Firefly for our community.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe / IBM)\n\nCB: How important will some things like tracing credentials and transparency become? AC: Tracing credentials and transparency are becoming essential in today\u2019s digital landscape. As the lines between real and synthetic or AI-generated content blur, provenance tools like Content Credentials play a critical role in helping to restore trust online. Content Credentials are akin to a 'nutrition label' for digital content that anyone can attach to their work to share information about themselves and provide context about how it was created and edited. With this information at consumers\u2019 fingertips, they have the ability to decide if they can trust the content they see online. In a world where misinformation and deepfakes can cause real harm, features like being able to trace a content\u2019s provenance become essential. We imagine a world where checking for Content Credentials is as habitual as reading a nutrition label on food packaging. This shift represents more than just technological progress \u2013 it's a reimagining of how we establish and sustain trust in the digital ecosystem.\n\nCB: With many artists still concerned about Gen AI, what steps are you taking to ensure those using Adobe apps are confident and comfortable in their use? AC: We understand that some creators are concerned about generative AI, and we\u2019re committed to addressing these concerns, while fostering confidence in the tools we create. We created Firefly for the creative community to give them more power, precision and control directly in the workflows they rely on every day. Adobe has always stood with the creative community, and we\u2019re continuing that tradition by ensuring our family of Firefly models are developed with accountability, responsibility, and transparency in mind. To date, Firefly has been used to generate over 16 billion images worldwide and, importantly, it\u2019s trained exclusively on licensed content, including Adobe Stock or content where copyright has expired, so creators can trust the foundation of the technology. We also understand that some people prefer not to use AI in their workflows. Adobe offers non-AI-powered applications as well to provide creators choice and respect their preferences. Our latest offering for our creative community includes the Adobe Content Authenticity web app which has a \u2018Gen AI Training and Usage Preference\u2019 setting, allowing artists to apply Content Credentials to their work to signal if they do not want their work used to train other generative AI models in the market. The web app also allows creators to gain attribution for their work. We believe all models should respect creators\u2019 rights and preferences, and our approach reflects a deep respect for the creative community.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nCB: What measures are in place to prevent Adobe's AI tools from unintentionally infringing on copyrighted works or mimicking the styles of specific artists without permission? AC: Successfully resolving the copyright question needs careful consideration and collaboration from the public and private sector to ensure that ultimately it is the creator who wins. It\u2019s also important to consider two distinct issues which include input (what model developers are using to train AI) and output (what types of images are being produced by an AI model). AI is only as good as the data on which it is trained. Training on more data helps ensure the model is more accurate and less biased. Some model developers scrape the web to source their training data, including copyrighted materials. From a legal perspective, this is a question that is currently being considered in countries like the UK and by Congress in the US. At Adobe, we chose to train only on licensed content and public domain content where copyright has expired. Our model is designed to be commercially safe even in an evolving legal landscape.\n\nAt Adobe, we chose to train only on licensed content and public domain content where copyright has expired Alexandru Costin, Vice President of Generative AI and Sensei at Adobe\n\nWhen it comes to addressing creator concerns, we think it is more effective to focus on output because this is what consumers ultimately see in the marketplace. Reason being that you have some celebrities worried about AI from a name, image and likeness perspective and we\u2019ve heard concerns from a vast array of creators (musicians, graphic artists, photographers, designers) about someone misusing an AI that has been trained on their work to impersonate their style and then using that output to compete with them in the marketplace. That doesn\u2019t seem fair. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve advocated for a federal anti-impersonation right in the U.S. that can give creators protection against these types of bad actors in the age of AI.\n\nCB: How does Adobe engage with artists and the community to gain feedback and react to AI developments and concerns? AC: Creators are at the core of who we are as a company and building a legacy of trust by supporting them through every evolution in creativity is a responsibility we take seriously. It\u2019s why we constantly engage with our community to understand their concerns. These conversations don\u2019t just guide our innovations; they ensure we\u2019re creating tools that protect, empower, and enhance the creative journey. An example of this can be taken from the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which was designed for creators by creators. We worked closely with our creative community at every stage of development - holding one-on-one and group listening sessions to understand their pain points, gathering feedback on key features, and refining the user experience to ensure this web app enhances their creative endeavours.\n\nCB: How is Adobe protecting its users, and do you need other companies to adopt the same processes, and maybe Content Credentials as an industry standard, to ensure it works? AC: We co-founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) in 2019, an initiative aimed at increasing trust and transparency online. Today, the CAI boasts more than 4,000 members consisting of major industry players including global social media platforms, generative AI providers, media organisations, tech companies, camera manufacturers, civil societies and more. Adobe is also a founding member of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a global standards group that evolves the technical specifications for Content Credentials. We\u2019ve seen increased adoption and mainstream implementation of Content Credentials from both the public and private sectors, including by Google, TikTok, OpenAI, Meta, LinkedIn, and BBC News. We believe the more places that Content Credentials technology shows up, the more valuable they become as a tool for fostering a trustworthy digital ecosystem. Content Credentials is also supported in a range of Adobe products and properties including Photoshop, Lightroom, Express, Stock, and Premiere Pro. Importantly, we automatically apply Content Credentials to assets generated with Adobe Firefly as part of our commitment to supporting transparency around the use of generative AI. As we navigate a new digital frontier where generative AI offers new possibilities, but also brings uncertainty and challenges with deepfakes and deceptive content, we'll see an unprecedented push for transparency in digital content as the private and public sectors recognise the critical need for an industry-wide content provenance standard. Content Credentials will play a pivotal role in this shift. To truly protect creators and address their concerns, cross-industry collaboration between industry and government in working towards an industry-wide content provenance standard will become even more imperative. Whilst Content Credentials may not be a 'silver bullet', they are a critical tool in restoring trust online. Coalescing around this tool can ensure that Content Credentials becomes the gold standard for transparency, authenticity, and trust in the digital age.\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nCB: Do you see added value to art with attached Content Credentials (in a similar way to the trad art's certificate of authenticity)? AC: Content Credentials redefine how value is created and shared in the digital art ecosystem, offering profound benefits to both artists and audiences. For creators, the value lies in enhanced protection, recognition, and visibility. For consumers, Content Credentials serve as a window into the art\u2019s origins and story. Audiences can gain deeper insights into the creator\u2019s identity, the creative process, and the tools or techniques used to bring the piece to life. By connecting creators and viewers through an authenticated digital chain of custody, Content Credentials offer a dual value proposition. It protects and empowers artists while educating and engaging audiences, setting a new standard for integrity and trust in the digital age.\n\nCB: Can Content Credentials be edited or tampered with? AC: Content Credentials are designed to be a robust and secure way to label digital content by combining three key technologies: secure metadata, watermarking, and fingerprinting. While each of these techniques alone might not be completely durable, together they create a reliable and tamper-proof system. Secure metadata digitally signs information like when and where the content was created, who made it, and any edits made along the way. Watermarking adds an invisible stamp to the content that isn\u2019t detectable by the human eye or ear. Fingerprinting assigns a unique identifier to the content based on its characteristics, allowing it to be matched to the original provenance information if needed. The unique combination of these three techniques under a single solution, Content Credentials, presents the most comprehensive solution today for digital content provenance for images, audio and video.",

            "content": "Forecasting the market conditions and industry outlook for 2025 is an exercise in contradiction; from unforeseen delays to rapidly evolving technology, we are predicting unpredictability. Navigating a clear path forward is challenging enough when we can\u2019t even see all the obstacles in our path ahead. Calculating a single, perfect strategy for 2025 is not only impossible, it is impractical. Companies working in supply chain will be better served by adapting a more holistic approach, one focused on the ability to be flexible, solutions-oriented and responsive. In short, the primary determinant of success will be agility.\n\nCombine Responsiveness with Urgency\n\nTo be agile, companies must be not only flexible but have the ability to pivot at speed, which requires a high level of preparedness for all possible outcomes. The 2024 presidential election is a prime example of why agility is so critical. Depending on the outcome, regulations are equally likely to increase or decrease; the companies that will see the best outcomes are the ones that have prepared for both.\n\nThis level of unpredictability is nothing new, in the post-COVID world; challenges that were unforeseen in 2024 will persist, and likely intensify, in 2025. Supply still outweighs demand, and costs are still rising as a result of inflation. While these issues aren\u2019t cause for celebration, they are reason to look adapt a measured approach, avoiding alarmism and focusing on strategic planning.\n\nFortunately, agility and preparedness are familiar virtues for third-party logistics providers (3PLs). Global freight demand has recognizable patterns to an extent, but shifts in geopolitical conditions have always baked uncertainty into those patterns. Even so, 3PLs should prepare for larger-scale industry changes. E-commerce, already a force of change in supply chain, continues to affect costs due to increased customer demand. With 53% of all cost per shipment in the final mile, this costly segment presents an opportunity for agile collaboration between companies to further improve efficiency and innovation.\n\nProactivity and Reactivity\n\nWhile an agile approach may appear to encourage reactivity, true agility requires a great deal of proactivity, including awareness of the many potential scenarios that may arise. The more contingency plans a company has for supply chain, the better. And the key to effective proactive planning is actionable data. Businesses should prioritize tech solutions that provide a clear and continuous flow of information enabling insights, analysis, and actionable next steps to be derived.\n\nThese actionable next steps should address both the immediate needs and longer term strategies. The window that companies have to make critical decisions in response to changing circumstances can be short; therefore, it is essential to have an extensive list of contingency plans. These plans should clearly outline specific actions to minimize disruptions. Leveraging technology that provides real time data and based on prior information, even predicts potential changes based on past and current trends is essential. This not only gives companies a broader window to react, but also equips them with more efficient plans for moving forward.\n\nShort-term Contingencies and Long-term Objectives\n\nWhile creating short-term contingency plans, companies should also keep their eyes on long term strategies that will benefit them well beyond 2025. Two key strategies to consider include a focus on nearshoring and 3PL partnerships for small carriers. Both have the potential to unlock new efficiencies or possibly even sidestep some future challenges.\n\nThe push for nearshoring has already begun industry-wide, and as time goes on, it will only become harder and more costly for companies that have delayed nearshoring initiatives. Canada and Mexico present a compelling opportunity to move goods closer to home, reducing the potential for delays. Mexico is especially ripe for investment, given that many areas are still developing robust infrastructure; by investing at an early stage, companies can establish a mutually beneficial relationship with local governments.\n\nWhere nearshoring is primarily concerned with avoiding disruptions, for carriers, partnering with 3PLs is a strategic move towards an increased capacity of loads and geographical reach.\n\nBy leveraging the scale and infrastructure of 3PLs, carriers can reduce operational cost while focusing on core competencies. By working with the right 3PL, small- to medium-sized carriers could have the resources, financially and otherwise, to be agile enough to meet customer expectations despite logistical challenges. Expanding a carrier\u2019s capacity to meet continuously evolving customer expectations is a crucial strategy for achieving long-term success.\n\n2025 and Beyond\n\nUltimately, 2025 is most likely to bring with it the same challenges the industry has faced throughout 2024, as well as changes to technology, customer needs, and supply chain conditions that are as yet undefined. Agility will be the single most defining factor in a company\u2019s ability to overcome these obstacles, old and new, and agility demands preparedness. Preparedness in turn demands data. One of the most strategic moves company leaders can make in preparation for 2025 is to ensure a high-quality flow of information, as well as tech solutions that provide transparency and empirical predictions. Reliable data and market predictions fuel effective contingency planning and can provide organizations extra time in which to make critical decisions. These contingency plans should be as data-driven, detailed, and as actionable as possible to empower organizational agility.\n\nLooking further ahead, applying the same degree of proactivity to future operations will be key to positioning supply chain organizations for ongoing success. Nearshoring, particularly in Mexico, is an ongoing trend that will only become more prevalent as time goes on, with increasing barriers to entry. The best time to begin moving in the direction of nearshoring, as they say, was yesterday; the second-best time is today. Additionally, strategic partnerships between carriers and 3PLs are a strong step in pursuit of agility, utilizing resources on a broader scale and benefiting from the efficiencies provided by a larger organization.\n\nAs we move into the future, we are served far less by trepidation and anxiety than preparedness and proactivity. When the future is uncertain, any decision that enhances agility, strengthens customer relationships or improves operational efficiencies is one that business leaders can confidently stand behind, both in 2025 and beyond.",

Previously, the FDA granted rare pediatric disease designation to dordaviprone for H3K27M-mutant glioma.\n\nThe NDA includes efficacy data from 50 patients treated across a phase 1 trial (NCT03416530), 3 phase 2 trials (NCT02525692; NCT03295396; NCT03134131), and a compassionate use program.2,3\n\nPooled efficacy data published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology showed that patients experienced an overall response rate (ORR) of 20.0% (95% CI, 10.0%-33.7%) per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology high-grade glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 40.0% (95% CI, 26.4%-54.8%).3 The median time to response was 8.3 months (range, 1.9-15.9), and the median duration of response was 11.2 months (95% CI, 3.8-not reached).\n\nPer RANO-HGG/low-grade glioma (LGG) criteria, the ORR was 30.0% (95% CI, 17.9%-44.6%), and the DCR was 44.0% (95% CI, 30.0%-58.7%).\n\n\u201cThis NDA submission marks a pivotal moment for Chimerix in our mission to bring this potentially life-altering drug to patients diagnosed with recurrent H3K27M-mutant diffuse glioma,\u201d Mike Andriole, CEO of Chimerix, stated in a news release.1 \u201cWith this submission, we now turn our attention to preparing for potential commercial launch in the US next year. To maximize availability and access of dordaviprone at launch, we have enhanced our commercial capabilities across multiple functions including market access, distribution, reimbursement, patient services, marketing and commercial operations, all supported by a robust manufacturing and quality management system.\u201d\n\nDordaviprone is a novel, first-in-class, small molecule imipridone designed to selectively target the mitochondrial protease ClpP and DRD2.\n\nThe pooled analysis included patients with at least 2 years of age with recurrent and/or progressive H3K27M-mutant glioma with measurable disease per RANO-HGG criteria.3 A Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of at least 60 was required. A washout period of at least 90 days was required after the last treatment with radiation therapy.\n\nDuring the studies, patients at least 18 years of age received dordaviprone at 625 mg, and pediatric patients were administered the agent at a dose based on body weight. Patients were treated once per week or once every 3 weeks in treatment cycles of 3 to 4 weeks, depending on the specific study design. Treatment continued until disease progression.\n\nORR per RANO-HGG criteria as assessed by blinded independent central review served as the primary end point of the analysis.\n\nSafety data showed that 49 of 50 patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse effect (TEAE). The most common any-grade TEAEs included fatigue (46.0%), nausea (36%), and headache (32.0%).\n\nAny-grade treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 60.0% of patients, including 20% who had grade 3 TRAEs. The most common any-grade TRAEs consisted of fatigue (34.0%), nausea (18.0%), decreased lymphocyte count (14.0%), headache (10.0%), vomiting (10.0%), anemia (6.0%), decreased appetite (6.0%), dizziness (6.0%), fall (6.0%), hemiparesis (6.0%), and maculopapular rash (6.0%).\n\nSerious AEs were reported in 46.0% of patients; hydrocephalus and nausea were the most common at 8.0% each.\n\nTEAEs led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, or dose interruption in 8.0% of patients. TRAEs did not lead to any treatment discontinuations, and 1 patient (2.0%) required dose reduction/interruption due to a TRAE (pulmonary embolism).\n\nReferences",

In 2024, lawmakers introduced a bill to provide legal protection for companies that fail to warn people about health and safety issues from pesticides, but the bill died in the Senate. The sponsor of the legislation says potential lawsuits create uncertainty for farmers and ranchers.\n\n\n\nBut Ruiz said there isn't enough warning about these chemicals and their impacts, and added it is not clear how many people have become ill from pesticides.\n\n\n\n\"I used to be a farm worker, and I know some of the ills that I have comes from pesticides. My family and friends and people that I know have long term effects from that, and there needs to be better ways and better resources and better studies to help us understand if we are getting harmed by pesticides or how to prevent them in a better way,\" she explained.\n\n\n\nRuiz said pesticides are also an issue in rural areas, where the chemicals can drift from fields to nearby homes and schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n\n\nA new report shows U.S. companies tackling oil and gas pollution are seeing solid and strong economic growth. Pennsylvania's methane mitigation industry is boosting the economy and job market, ranking among the top five states with 51 employee locations.\n\n\n\nMarcy Lowe, principal with Datu Research, says manufacturers and service firms in the industry help oil and gas operators reduce methane emissions by providing leak detection, measurement and mitigation equipment. She adds that natural gas is mostly methane, a potent greenhouse gas that drives global warming.\n\n\n\n\"These manufacturing and service firms play a really important role in getting a handle on climate change, since they're all about reducing emissions of methane, which is much more powerful in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide,\" she explained.\n\n\n\nThe report states that the number of U.S. companies in methane mitigation is growing fast, and in 2024, there were 268 companies, up 24% from 215 in 2021.\n\n\n\nLowe said significant industry growth is driving economic change across the country. In Pennsylvania, that growth is centered around Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where many companies are located. She added the jobs are stable and pay well, particularly in client-focused service sectors.\n\n\n\n\"In our interviews with companies, they tell us that these jobs have upward mobility as well, where someone might start with the company on the assembly line and end up with a much higher paying job, with much more responsibility for the future of the company,\" she continued.\n\n\n\nLeak-detection technology leads manufacturing, with 55 companies reporting its production. Lowe says in Pennsylvania, firms such as Heath Consultants are driving innovation with both tech and services. Nationwide, efforts are growing to replace gas-releasing pneumatic devices with electric or solar-powered alternatives, while reducing venting and flaring to cut methane emissions and fight climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\n",

            "content": "In 2025, playing it safe isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s time for brands to stop following the rules and instead challenge them.\n\nThere are so many touchpoints consumers engage with nowadays, and algorithms that force an endless stream of content across every device, every media outlet, and nearly every brick-and-mortar establishment, at all times. We have become desensitized, and it takes much more to capture our attention. To cut through, your brand has to do more than just fit into this ecosystem \u2014 it has to stand out. And that means taking risks, challenging norms, and getting comfortable with creating a little discomfort.\n\nBrands that thrive this year will be the ones that go rogue: that push boundaries and take chances on bold storytelling that feels real and unapologetic. It\u2019s no longer enough to be safe, predictable or perfectly polished. If you want to engage with today\u2019s consumers, you need to break stuff.\n\nHere are five tips for how you can redefine your communications and brand strategy in 2025:\n\n1. Consider Alternative Media\n\nFor years, brands have relied on traditional mainstream media outlets to reach broad audiences, but that\u2019s no longer the most effective strategy. Today there are a plethora of podcasts, niche creators and community-driven outlets to which consumers increasingly turn. Podcasts, with massive and loyal followings, often surpass traditional broadcast media in engagement.\n\nAlternative channels allow for hyper-targeted campaigns that speak directly to niche groups. By embracing these platforms, brands can connect with more engaged audiences while positioning themselves as innovators. By embracing new and niche channels, you\u2019re not only reaching more engaged audiences but also positioning your brand as willing to experiment and reach different groups.\n\n2. Create Subversive Campaigns\n\nWe\u2019ve become accustomed to the same tired formula of marketing, but the brands that now stand out are the ones that don\u2019t follow the script by breaking the rules. Jaguar\u2019s recent campaign exemplifies this shift. The company took a major risk by creating a campaign that broke the one cardinal rule of an automobile brand: it didn\u2019t feature a single car\u2014something almost unheard of in the automotive world. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nInstead, they crafted a lush cinematic piece that felt more like an avant-garde Vanity Fair editorial, showcasing luxury and sophistication without the obvious product placement. This subversive move shocked the public and received massive media coverage, demonstrating that when you break the mold, you get attention. Jaguar didn\u2019t just sell a car \u2014 they sold an experience, a feeling. By stepping away from predictability and delivering something unexpected, they created a story that resonated on a deeper level with their audience.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Embrace Unapologetic Messaging\n\nGone are the days of sugarcoating messages to please everyone. In 2025, going rogue means brands will be raw and unvarnished with their storytelling. Consumers value authenticity and the bravery to speak to them, rather than at them. They want brands to drop the polished facades and speak with honesty, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nWhen a brand shows the courage to be real \u2014 acknowledging flaws, addressing tough issues or challenging the status quo \u2014 it builds trust and establishes a deeper connection. This unapologetic approach creates a narrative that resonates on a human level, making it more memorable and impactful.\n\n4. Unpredictable Social Media Content\n\nSocial media in 2025 demands more than just consistent posting. It requires brands to inject a sense of unpredictability and fearlessness into their content. Audiences want to feel something when they engage \u2014 not just see another polished ad. Unpredictable storytelling and striking visuals are key to creating an emotional impact that sticks. It\u2019s about pushing boundaries with narratives that challenge expectations and visuals that captivate. Related Content\n\nA recent example of this is True Classic\u2019s ad, in which three men on a plane experience a dramatic in-flight emergency and depressurization, only for their clothes to tear off \u2014 giving them the opportunity to try on True Classic apparel instead. The humorous, unexpected twist of the ad generated a level of engagement I hadn\u2019t seen in years. People appreciated the mix of humor and the element of surprise, which helped it stand out in a crowded digital space.\n\n5. Reimagine Your Customer Touchpoints\n\nIt\u2019s no longer enough to focus on traditional advertising and PR. Looking forward means rethinking every touchpoint in which your brand interacts with consumers. Whether it\u2019s point-of-purchase experiences, digital engagement or event activations, every touchpoint should tell a part of your brand\u2019s story in a disruptive, unexpected way. If you want to go rogue, focus on surprising your audience with new experiences at every turn. They will respect you so much more if you don\u2019t handle them with kid gloves.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLet the start of the new year be a time for you to stop playing by the old rules and start creating your own. When you do so, you not only command attention \u2014 you generate an unprecedented level of respect and, ultimately, if done right, an undeniable presence in the market. And in 2025, that\u2019s what will separate the brands that are remembered from the ones that are forgotten.",

            "content": "Three new state laws aimed at improving the health of Pennsylvanians are taking effect in 2025.\n\n1. Improved Workers Compensation for Emergency Responders\n\nStarting this fall, emergency responders will qualify for workers compensation benefits if they experience post-traumatic stress injuries on the job. The law was pushed forward by state Rep. Jennifer O\u2019Mara, D-Delaware, after she lost her father, a Philadelphia firefighter, to suicide.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of suicide, we\u2019re haunted not just by the loss, but by the silence of what might have been prevented,\u201d O\u2019Mara said in a statement. \u201cThat feeling has driven me to see this legislation through, so that it can majorly reduce harm to our emergency-responder community in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 30% of emergency responders develop behavioral health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder or injuries. The new law essentially lowers the burden of proof for first-responders. Under the current law, first responders had to prove there were \u201cobjective abnormal working conditions\u201d to establish a PTSI claim, a level often difficult to meet.\n\nOne of the sponsors of the Senate bill, Sen. Camera Barlotta, said in a statement, \u201cFirst responders commonly experience the most harrowing moments in others\u2019 lives as part of their jobs. Because it\u2019s typical for them \u2014 as opposed to something that would be very out of the ordinary for most other jobs \u2014 they were often barred from accessing important care.\u201d\n\nTo qualify for compensation, the first responder would need to be diagnosed by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. The law goes into effect on Oct. 30, 2025.\n\n2. Certified Doula Services\n\nTo improve maternal health, Medicaid will now cover certified doula services in the state. Doulas provide childbirth education and support services, including physical and emotional support, during pregnancy, labor and delivery and up to one year postpartum.\n\nState Rep. Morgan Cephas, D-Phila., co-chair of the Pennsylvania Black Maternal Health Caucus, introduced the House bill.\n\n\u201cLack of coverage for doula services in Medicaid leads to a vast disparity in care for women who are already statistically at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, with Black birthing people at the highest risk of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity compared to other racial and ethnic groups,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis new law will give these parents a proven network of support needed to produce better mental and physical health outcomes during their birthing journey.\u201d\n\n3. Biomarker Testing\n\nAnother new law requires state-regulated health insurance plans, including Medicaid, to cover biomarker testing that can improve treatment for cancer, degenerative diseases like ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease) and certain chronic and autoimmune disorders.\n\nBiomarker testing provides more personalized, targeted treatment that can improve outcomes for patients.\n\n\u201cThis game-changing bill is good for Pennsylvania \u2014 the health of our state and its residents,\u201d Donna Greco, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in Pennsylvania, said in a statement. \u201cEnsuring that more Pennsylvanians will have access to proven biomarker testing will mean more patients battling cancer and many other forms of chronic disease will have the information needed to identify the best treatments possible.\u201d\n\nWhen it was signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro on July 1, Pennsylvania became the 20th state in the nation to require insurance coverage of biomarker testing.",

            "content": "In October 2024, the U.S. supply chain was on the brink of severe disruption due to a looming port strike. With today\u2019s unpredictable world, supply chains face constant challenges, from port strikes and geopolitical disruptions to rapid shifts in consumer demand. This vulnerability highlights the need for logistic companies to prioritize risk management that ensure stability in today\u2019s technology-driven world. As supply chain challenges become more frequent, nine out of 10 industry leaders reported experiencing significant disruptions in a 2024 survey.\n\nEvery leader in the industry should be asking themselves: How prepared is your organization to manage supply chain risks?\n\nThe logistics industry lies at the heart of global trade, tasked with balancing efficiency, speed and safety across borders. As supply chains become more interconnected, so do the risks. Every operational disruption, ranging from policy changes to natural disasters to cyber-attacks, can set off a chain reaction that shakes the entire supply chain. Companies without robust plans are increasingly at risk of service interruptions and financial loss.\n\nTurn Risk into Opportunity\n\nYet, many logistics companies remain reactive rather than proactive in their approach to risk management. According to Gartner, only 46% of supply chain networks have increased resilience and redundancy efforts over the past two years. A reactive approach leaves organizations vulnerable, scrambling to address problems after they arise instead of preventing them. To thrive, companies must pivot from short-term risk mitigation to long-term stability. While current disruptions need to be managed, supply chains are less likely to flourish with a crisis-to-crisis mentality. Effective risk management requires identifying affected workflows or suppliers, adjusting workflows to use alternate options, and quickly communicating updates to necessary stakeholders. By adopting these strategies, organizations help secure their supply chains and ensure consistent value delivery to customers. Risk mitigation has evolved from being reactive and companies must start embracing a proactive strategy.\n\nAI in Modern Risk Management\n\nThe adoption of AI and automation has transformed operational efficiency. A report from the American Manufacturing Resilience quarterly survey from Xometry found that 70% of manufacturing CEOs report that AI is delivering a \u201cstrong ROI\u201d for their operations. AI and automation empower companies to implement proactive risk management models that address everything from supply chain disruptions to data security. Through automated decision-making, potential issues can be identified earlier and responded to quicker with more efficiency to avoid disruptions and minimize risk.\n\nAI-based proactive measures can prevent equipment failures that could halt operations. Similarly, digital tracking and alerts help companies keep up with evolving standards without requiring constant hands-on monitoring. These AI-driven tools are quickly becoming essential to maintaining effortless and secure operations in an industry that is inherently fast-paced. By adopting these advanced tools, logistics companies are increasingly ready to answer the crucial question: How prepared is your organization to manage supply chain risks?\n\nStreamlining Operations with Workflow Orchestration\n\nAI and automation have taken logistics to a new level, but coordinating these tools effectively is a challenge as operations grow more complex. The core of leveling up your technology is adapting a workflow orchestration platform to build strong systems. Orchestration brings together automated and manual processes, helping to ensure that each part of the system works together smoothly. It also adds an extra layer of control, especially as microservices are adopted, which increase flexibility but can add layers of complexity if not properly managed. It\u2019s crucial to find a platform that works best for an organization but is also a solution that is highly reliable, flexible, customizable and most importantly, offers high observability. A strong workflow orchestration platform manages complexities confidently, ensuring each part of an operation stays aligned and responsive, even as new challenges come to the table.\n\nFor example, orchestrated workflows in routing and scheduling can automatically adapt to fluctuations in demand or unexpected issues, ensuring that shipments stay on track and customers remain satisfied. This added structure helps avoid potential service disruptions and operational bottlenecks, making them more adaptable in the face of external risks.\n\nSecurity is another important area where workflow orchestration adds value. In an industry where confidential data is dealt with daily, orchestrated workflows create a more secure environment through features like role-based access control and organized data flows. By setting access permissions based on individual roles, orchestration ensures that employees can only view the data relevant to their responsibilities, which significantly lowers the chances of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nAdapting Quickly to Changing Demands\n\nA major advantage of workflow orchestration is its ability to scale operations effectively; this is a must in an industry that experiences frequent demand fluctuations. With orchestrated systems in place, companies can quickly adapt to high-volume periods without sacrificing operational integrity or data accuracy. This scalability is essential for those that handle high transaction volumes, as it allows them to meet customer demands without risking system overload.\n\nAI is changing logistics, bringing new capabilities like real-time route optimization, fraud detection, and pricing adjustments to match demand more efficiently. As companies incorporate these AI capabilities, they need strong orchestration to manage processes effectively. Orchestration keeps these tools working in sync without adding risks, such as data conflicts or system delays that can disrupt workflows.\n\nA reliable orchestration framework is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Those with orchestration systems can adopt new technologies and scale operations seamlessly, whether addressing increased demand or managing complex disruptions. This adaptability ensures companies are equipped for today\u2019s challenges while improving stability for tomorrow\u2019s uncertainties.\n\nAs supply chain risks evolve, the logistics industry must invest resources beyond reactive operational support. By adopting a proactive stance, supported by AI, automation and orchestration, companies can mitigate risks effectively, adapt to changes quickly, and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nThe future of supply chain resilience lies in orchestrated, technology-driven workflows. With a platform that is reliable under pressure, flexible to evolving demands, customizable to specific needs and equipped with high observability, organizations can move beyond reactive strategies. Those that embrace this evolution in risk management will not only protect their operations but also push forward innovation and efficiency in the logistics sector.",

While this ubiquitous file type may be Adobe's most well-known application, it's the company's creative suite that is the primary driver of the financial results. Products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro are industry standards for creative fields, even as competition has increased over time.\n\nProof of Adobe's market position is evident in its financial results. Like all businesses, there are sometimes short-term bumps in the road, but over the long run, Adobe has been remarkably consistent. Consider revenue, net income, and free cash flow over the last five years.\n\nADBE Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nADBE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nWhile Adobe's track record is impressive, investing is about the future and the biggest potential disruption to Adobe's market dominance is artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the tasks creators would do within Adobe's products can already be produced by AI, and the capabilities of AI are increasing every day.\n\nAdobe has chosen to embrace this new technology and has been working hard to embed its AI product, Firefly, into its software suite. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for Adobe's products, the company believes it can be an assistant to the creative process by taking care of some of the more menial tasks, freeing up the creator to be creative.\n\nTime will tell how successful this strategy will be, and the market seems to be waiting to find out. Adobe currently trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. While that's not a cheap multiple, it is below Adobe's five-year mean P/E ratio of 47. For investors who believe Adobe will be able to harness the power of AI, rather than be disrupted by it, today's price could prove to be a bargain.\n\nASML\n\nMuch like Adobe, Dutch manufacturer ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is the leader in its industry. ASML manufactures the lithography machines necessary to make all semiconductor chips. When it comes to the most advanced semiconductors, ASML is the only company in the world that makes the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines necessary for those cutting-edge chips.\n\nWith that kind of competitive advantage, one would expect ASML to trade for a very rich valuation, and that's usually the case. However, the semiconductor industry's cyclical downtown (AI chips notwithstanding) combined with the geopolitical restrictions on where advanced semiconductors can be sold have cast more uncertainty over the business than is typical. This has led to ASML trading for almost the same discount to its five-year mean P/E ratio as Adobe.\n\nASML PE Ratio Chart\n\nASML PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nASML's management believes the challenges it is facing will last into 2025 before any recovery is seen. While that could mean further stock dips, ASML's discount right now presents a compelling buying opportunity for a company that will be at the center of one of the most important industries for years to come.\n\nASML expects overall semiconductor sales to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030, providing some insight into the demand that is waiting on the other side of this cyclical downturn. Perhaps more importantly, the company believes that semiconductor sales for servers, data centers, and storage will be twice that of overall sales.\n\nThis should mean there will be continuing demand for ASML's most advanced EUV machines, as this is where the AI spending should be concentrated.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

But, it\u2019s not as hard to complete forms or annotate documents in this format, and you don\u2019t even need expensive software to do it.\n\nHere we look at a collection of PDF apps that are either completely free, or have a free trial version with a lot of the necessary functionality for a one-off PDF editing requirement.\n\nSome of these apps do certain things better than others, so the best PDF editor for you will depend on what your particular needs. For example, if you want a PDF editor that can use OCR (optical character recognition) to read the text on a page you have scanned, and allow you to edit it, we have an option that can allow you to do that. If you need some more functionality than these free options offer take a look at our Best PDF Editor for Mac round-up.\n\nPROMOTION EaseUS PDF Editor | edit PDFs on a Mac with ease EaseUS PDF Editor offers Mac and Windows users a complete PDF toolkit to edit text and graphics, convert into/from PDF documents, combine multiple files into a PDF, annotate PDFs, add security features, free OCR, and more. With the most reliable tools for editing PDFs, your PDFs become effortless. Start from only $44.95/year ($59.95/year) now.\n\n\n\nNow 25% OFF Exclusive Code: MACWORLD25\n\n\n\nFree Download Get EaseUS PDF Editor for Mac\n\nAlternatively, if you are looking for a PDF editor that\u2019s simple to use and flexible enough to let you fill in a form without pulling out your hair, we have one below. We have even found a PDF tool that will let you import a PDF into Word (or Pages) and edit it there.\n\nWe have looked at the following features and abilities of the PDF Editors reviewed here:\n\nImport: How faithful to the original PDF is the PDF editor? Does it maintain fonts and spacing? Can you open the PDF in Word, Excel etc?\n\nEditing: Can you select text from the original PDF? Is the new text added in a separate text box? How easy is it to edit and delete content from the PDF? Can you move content around? Does the text you add maintain the style and formatting of the original PDF? Can you add hyperlinks or attach documents? Can you add images?\n\nCollaboration: What markup tools are available? Can you highlight, underline, or strikethrough text? Can you use freehand drawing tools and an eraser. Can you add stamps? Can you track who reads and edits?\n\nSigning: Can you add a signature? Is this signature scanned, imported, or typed? How many signatures can you save?\n\nSaving: Can you resize the PDF? Can you stitch pages from multiple docs? Can you delete pages? Can you rotate pages?\n\nFind & Replace: Can the PDF editor search the PDF? Can you find and replace words? Can you redact words?\n\nOCR: Can the PDF editor read a scanned page \u2013 and can you edit that?\n\nWatermark: Does it add a watermark? Can you add your own watermark?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that macOS comes with some PDF editing capabilities of its own in Preview, and you can read a bit more about how to work with it in tips for using Preview to edit a PDF on a Mac and How to make a PDF on Mac. We also cover How to scan documents and make PDFs on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nApple Preview Pros Already on your Mac\n\nSurprisingly capable Cons Limited feature set for advanced users There is a free PDF editor already available on your Mac and it\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s got some limitations, but it\u2019s likely to offer enough tools for you if you just need to fill in some responses to questions on a PDF. You can use Preview to add text to PDFs, sometimes it recognizes where text should go, other times you need to add your own text boxes, in that case it can be a bit fiddly to get the text box to line up with the text on the page, but it\u2019s not impossible. You can change the size, color and font you use. You can also perform actions like strike-through \u2013 initially, we used the line shape, but then we discovered that it is possible to select strike-through from the menu (Tools > Annotate). You can also underline text the same way. These options are also available from the highlighter palette. Under Annotate in the menu are options for adding a speech bubble. You can also add comments in the form of sticky notes. Our spellings were checked as we typed \u2013 indicated by the usual squiggly line. Adding a signature is simple, with three options for doing so: using a trackpad, iPhone or iPad, or by signing your name on a piece of paper and holding it up to the camera. You can save multiple signatures and add them to the document easily. We have a guide to adding a signature to a PDF here. It\u2019s easy to shuffle pages and add and delete pages from a Preview PDF. If you can\u2019t already see the thumbnail view on the left click on the dropdown box above the A icon and choose Thumbnails. Now that you can see the thumbnails it is easy to shuffle page order, delete a page, and you can even drag and drop another PDF into the thumbnail column to add it. It is also easy to rotate pages (click on the page in the Thumbnail view and click on the rotate icon in the menu). You can export your PDF as a JPEG, TIFF, but there are no options for exporting to other apps, such as Word or Pages. Preview also offers an OCR \u2013 optical character recognition. If you are running macOS Monterey or later and you open anything in Preview \u2013 be it a PDF or a photo \u2013 you will be able to select most forms of text and cut and paste it into a text document. We were able to select text, even if it was on a slant, and generally, the results were good. Since macOS Sonoma macOS it\u2019s been possible to auto-fill PDFs with your name, address, phone number and other data saved in your Contacts app. As we said above, Preview offers enough features if all you need to do is enter a bit of text and sign a PDF. So if you are trying to fill in an application form or filling in a few yes or no checkboxes, it\u2019s likely to be sufficient. Those wanting a little more flexibility may find that Preview might not have enough features\u2026 in which case we have some options below that might prove more tempting. Also read our full guide to using Preview on the Mac. Read our full Preview review Adobe Acrobat Reader Pros Free tier is quite useful\n\nComment, annotate and sign PDFs\n\nFree trial for paid tiers Cons Some of the more advanced features only on paid tiers\n\nExpensive if you need a subscription Adobe Acrobat Reader is free for some basic use, but some of the features require moving to the Standard or Pro tiers that come with a monthly, annual or prepaid annual subscription. Standard costs from $12.99/\u00a313.14 p/m. The Pro tier will set you back $19.99/\u00a319.96 p/m. There\u2019s a 7-day free trial available for these additional features. However, there are a lot of features that are available for free. You\u2019ll find these in the Comment and Fill & Sign sections. To add text to the PDF choose Fill & Sign. Here you will also find the options to add a tick or a cross, a circle, or a line. The signature option is here too, we\u2019ll look at that in more detail below. Comment options include the ability to add a speech bubble, highlight, underline, and strike-through words. In fact, you can strike-through and add a related comment. All your comments will appear in the sidebar on the right. There are also tools here to draw and erase what you draw. A stamp tool with options like Approved, Revised, Confidential, Sign Here, and the option to import your own (these need to be in the PDF format, but it could be a way to add an image). When adding a signature you have options to Type, Draw (using a mouse or trackpad), or Image. If you opt for the latter you could import a scan or photograph of your signature \u2013 you can import any image this way, but it will appear translucent, with the background appearing behind it as you can see from our illustration. Acrobat Reader offers enough features to make it worth the download. It can be a tad annoying when it looks like you need to get a subscription to use features that it turns out can be performed without signing up, so beware of this before you spend.

Wondershare PDFelement Pros Edit text and images\n\nCreate new PDFs\n\n7-day trial of full software Cons Watermark can\u2019t be removed on free version\n\nLimited tools unless you pay\n\nNo monthly plan Wondershare\u2019s PDFelement app brings a streamlined interface and additional capabilities that make it a fine choice for those who want pro-level features at an affordable price, although there is, as with so many of these options, a free 7 day trial version. With the latter, you can edit images and text, create PDFs and print them. If you register the demo then you\u2019ll get access to almost the full range of features available on the paid version. One caveat here is that you\u2019ll only be able to remove the PDF Element Pro watermark on the paid version and you\u2019re limited to PDFs with a maximum of three pages. With the full software, you can create new PDFs from scratch, convert Word, Excel or PowerPoint files, as well as quickly produce forms that can be used online, replete with dropdown menus. Editing an existing PDF is straightforward, with tools for adding text or comments, annotating images and documents, plus the standard option of inserting a signature created on the trackpad. There are also OCR capabilities that make it easy to scan in documents and have them converted into usable PDFs in minutes. PDFelement is a comprehensive package with an interface that\u2019s simple and intuitive. The full Pro license costs $89.99/\u00a383.06 per year or $139.99/\u00a3129.20 for a perpetual license (the company adds on a Download Insurance Service, but you can remove this). If you\u2019d prefer a free version that you don\u2019t have to pay for, PDF Reader is also from Wondershare, but this is an entirely free version of PDFelement that you can use on your iPad or iPhone to read, edit, annotate, convert and sign PDFs. You just need to register with Wondershare to use the app. We\u2019re mentioning it here because, while it\u2019s not a Mac app, you might be happy to edit the PDF on your iPad or iPhone for the sake of getting a free option. Incidentally, there is a Windows version of PDF Reader. Once the app was downloaded to our iPhone we were able to open PDFs that were stored in iCloud, edit text and add your own. You can add crosses and ticks (checks), draw on the PDF, strike through text, highlight text, and create and add a signature. Once your changes are made you can save. Download Wondershare\u2019s PDF Reader from the iOS App Store Read our full Wondershare PDFelement review Readdle PDF Expert Pros Fully featured 7-day trial\n\nLifetime plan is good value\n\nLots of tools Cons No permanent free tier PDF Expert for Mac from Readdle offers a seven-day full-featured free trial, which could make it ideal if you just need a solution now and don\u2019t expect to be editing PDFs again for a while. If you do need it for longer than a week it costs $79.99/\u00a372.99 a year on subscription, or $139.99/\u00a3139.99 if you choose the Lifetime plan. We found PDF Expert did a good job of maintaining the fonts, style and formatting of the original PDF. There are two options for editing that you can find in the menu at the top of the page: Annotate and Edit. Under Annotate you will find the tool to easily add text to the PDF. You can choose the font and color of the text here. However, you will find the better editing tools under Edit. Here you have the option to actually edit the text already on the page, add images, add hyperlinks, and redact sensitive information (you can choose to black out names, or you can search for a specific word and delete every occurrence of that.) We were able to select text and move it around the page. But as we found with all the PDF editors here, it wasn\u2019t possible to drag and drop text between pages (to get around this we were able to cut and paste and still make a good-looking document). Under the Annotate tab you will find options to highlight, underline, or strike-through text, as well as a pan tool that means you can draw freehand in any color, as well as change the line width and opacity. There\u2019s also a crop tool here. In Annotate you can also add sticky notes and stamps (e.g. an Approval). You\u2019ll see a column of existing annotations on the left so it\u2019s easy to see what edits have been made and when. These annotations can be exported as HTML, text or markdown. Adding a signature is also done via the Annotate tab. You can add more than one signature and these are added via the keyboard, trackpad, or an image. To add the signature to your PDF just drag and drop from the signature pane. You an also add a watermark yourself, perhaps your company logo, rather than having one added for you as is the case with some of the other trials looked at here. Resizing a large PDF was easy thanks to a High/Low slider that indicated the size of the resulting file. There was also the option to merge files, combine multiple documents into one PDF, or individual pages from multiple documents. We had one PDF that was scanned on our iPhone via the Notes app (we explain how to scan a document with an iPhone separately). Obviously such a document will only be recognized by the PDF editor if the editor has OCR abilities that are unlocked in the trial. PDFExpert couldn\u2019t do this so we weren\u2019t able to edit the text in the scanned document, although we were able to add hyperlinks to sections of that document. Obviously, we couldn\u2019t search the scanned document, or edit the text there. We were able to search normal PDFs though, and we were able to search for a word and redact every occurrence of it either by blacking it out, or deleting it. We were able to export the PDF into Word, PowerPoint and Excel, as well as to Text and Image. It\u2019s a free seven-day trial, so if you need the software for longer than that and don\u2019t want to pay up then you would have to look elsewhere. But if you don\u2019t need something long term this trial offers everything you need. Read our full Readdle PDF Expert review Abbyy FineReader Pro for Mac Pros OCR capabilities\n\nAllows PDF content to be edited in Word or Pages Cons A bit hit and miss at times\n\nQuite a niche product\n\nPreview now has OCR capabilites Abbyy FineReader is the app to try if you want OCR (optical character recognition) capabilities (although Preview does now offer these). However, we nearly didn\u2019t realize how deep the capabilities of this app went because the results can be a little hit-and-miss. Actually, the capabilities of the 30-day free trial version are pretty impressive, as long as you are willing to accept that it might not always do a great job of translating what it \u2018sees\u2019. We discovered this when we imported our PDF and were greeted with a warning to \u201cPlease re-scan your document at a higher resolution\u201d. Given the PDF we were imported hadn\u2019t been scanned we were a little confused by this. Then when we exported the \u2018scan\u2019 to Word we saw a warning that some of the pages had not been recognised. The resulting Word document (actually we opened it in Pages) was a little muddled, some of the translations were laughable. But the general content had come through well enough for us to be able to correct the mistakes. Now, this probably wouldn\u2019t do for you if you wanted to edit a straightforward PDF \u2013 if that\u2019s the case use one of the other apps. However, if you had scanned text from a book or a printout and you wanted to edit that then this is the app for you. As we mentioned earlier, we had a scan we had taken with our iPhone camera via the Notes app and we were able to get FineReader to \u2018read\u2019 this and open it as a Word document, which we could then edit. Sure, there might be a few words that are wrong, but it\u2019s got to be better than typing the whole thing out. Once in Word (or Pages), you can edit the document as much as you like. We did see a warning that fonts were missing, and there was a strange case of paragraph formatting that caused the text to wrap to the next line as if it was in a box, but it was a good effort we thought. As for collaboration and editing you have all the tools that are available in the app you end up opening the document in, be that Word, Pages, Excel, PowerPoint or something else. It might not be spot on every time, but the fact that we were able to scan a document and export it to Word where we could edit it, was a real bonus. You can buy an annual subscription to FineReader for $69.99/\u00a359.99, or one month for $11.99/\u00a311.99, also available in the Mac App Store. Read our full ABBYY FineReader Pro review Cisdem PDFMaster/EaseUS PDF Editor Pros Some useful tools\n\nEasy to use\n\nWeb based Cons File size limits on free tier\n\nReduced editing features unless you pay Best Prices Today: Retailer Price PDF Escape Free View Deal Product Price Cisdem PDFMaster is also distributed by EaseUS as their PDF Editor for Mac (which had us very confused when we first looked at it). It has a free trial that lasts 14 days, which may be enough for your purposes. Cisdem PDFMaster is a decent app for those looking to make casual adjustments to their documents, although it lacks some of the features required by professionals. You can download the app from multiple channels, including Apple\u2019s App Store, the aforementioned EaseUS website, and Cisdem\u2019s official website. Each version has a different price and there are some differences in functionality. Once you load a PDF document in the app, the toolbar it surfaces is similarly straightforward and easy to grasp. It\u2019s ideal for beginners with limited tech knowledge rather than those seeking an advanced PDF editor, since its feature set is somewhat limited. You can edit the text in the document, allowing you to add or remove words, change the font, insert links, move things around, and so on. The software also supports extensive annotation, including shape insertion, highlighting, underlining, striking through, leaving comments, guiding with arrows, and you can insert images, stamps, and digital signatures. Watermarking, document cropping, conversion to multiple file formats, size shrinking, optical character recognition (OCR), redaction, page reorganization, PDF comparisons, area calculations, are available. Foxit Reader Pros Simple and lightweight\n\nFree\n\nEnough tools for basic form-filling Cons Might not suit advanced users Completing our list is Foxit PDF Reader, which is a simple editor that, as the name suggests, allows you to open and read PDFs on your Mac. That\u2019s not all though, as the free program can also let you fill in forms and digitally sign documents. When you first open the app, it can look a little busy as Foxit places ads for its other software products, including the PDF Editor which is a more powerful version of Reader but requires a purchase. That\u2019s not necessary though, as Reader has plenty to offer. You can enter text into PDF fields, create a new signature or import one you may already have on your Mac so that you can sign-off on forms. Plus there are various annotation tools on hand, such as highlighting and adding notes. It\u2019s a nice little app that will probably be all that most people need if they don\u2019t work with PDFs very often. Read our full FoxIt PDF Editor review PDF Candy Pros Web based\n\nEasy to use\n\nUseful features Cons Hourly limits on free tier While there is no Mac app for PDF Candy, Mac users can use the free online version to add text to a PDF, as well as underlines, strike-throughs, and add signatures. You can also compress and merge PDFs, rearrange pages, delete pages, rotate and crop PDFs. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t add or change the text, so if you need to do that this isn\u2019t going to suffice (although you can place white overlay over content you want to hide). You can also convert PDFs to Word, Excel and various other documents using this free online tool. You then need to download it from the website. Unfortunately when we did this the Word document we ended up with wasn\u2019t quite what we\u2019d started with. There are limits to this free online version. For example, you can only perform one task per hour. If you want access to more tools (there are 47 in total) you need to register and select a plan. There are two on offer, you can pay monthly and cancel at any time for $6/\u00a36 or pay yearly for $48/\u00a348. LibreOffice Pros Full office suite\n\nEdit text and add images\n\nCreate PDFs Cons No signature feature\n\nLimited features compared to dedicated PDF editors LibreOffice is a free office suite with some handy features if you want to edit and update PDFs. Because it\u2019s an office suite you also benefit from all the Office-like features and familiar menus. We were able to open a PDF in LibreOffice and edit text and add text and images. We weren\u2019t able to add a signature, but this would be simple enough if you already had the signature as an image file. You can also create a PDF from a document you create in LibreOffice, just as you can from Pages or Word. Create the document and then choose File > Export as PDF. While it\u2019s not a dedicated PDF editor or creator you can do many of the things you are likely to want to do to a basic PDF, so it\u2019s a good option that comes with various benefits on account of it being a decent alternative to Microsoft Office. Read our round-up of the best word processors for Mac for more information. Skim Pros Completely free\n\nAdd notes, underline and highlight text Cons Basic\n\nMainly intended for reading PDFs Skim is an open source, free PDF reader, so as long as you don\u2019t expect more than basic functions you will be satisfied. The tool allows you to view PDFs, add notes, underlines and highlight text. Skim is more for reading PDFs \u2013 it was designed for academics, so it\u2019s less about filling in and editing PDFs and more about the comfort of reading and navigating them along with the ability to add notes and bookmark pages. If all you want is a PDF reader this may well suit you. You can download it here. PDF Escape (macOS) Pros Some useful tools\n\nEasy to use\n\nWeb based Cons File size limits on free tier\n\nReduced editing features unless you pay Best Prices Today: Retailer Price PDF Escape Free View Deal Product Price PDF Escape is another web-based editor that has decent tools on offer. To get started you upload documents to the site, then work in the online portal on your PDF. Like most of the packages on this list, there\u2019s a limited free tier or a more powerful version can be unlocked through a paid subscription. You can still do a fair bit of work with the free version, so it\u2019s a good place to start. There are three main areas in the interface, comprised of Insert, Annotate, and Page. Within each of these you\u2019ll find the relevant tools for editing text, images, links, adding notes, underlining and striking through text, plus you can reorder pages and use a few other useful organizational settings. PDF Escape does impose a 10MB file size limit on the free tier, which will make larger PDFs a no-go. Perhaps a more limiting restriction is that the free tier also has no way to edit the existing text in a PDF or even allow the conversion to another format. If your needs are modest, then it could do the job but basically, it\u2019s something akin to a demo rather than workable piece of software unless you sign up to a subscription. The current cost is $5.99 (\u00a34.80) per month or $35.88 (\u00a329) per year for Premium. There\u2019s also the Ultimate tier for or $8.99 (\u00a37) per month and $71.88 (\u00a359) per year. That\u2019s brings the ability to digitally sign documents, use the redaction feature, as well as sealing a document for added security. pdfFiller Pros Web based\n\n30-day free trial\n\nWide range of features Cons No free tier\n\nNo desktop version pdfFiller is another option if you want to edit and adjust a PDF. As with the other paid for PDF editors in this round-up, there is a 30-day free trial that you can use (although it\u2019s included with a full version when you sign up, so it would probably be more accurate to describe it as the first month free-you\u2019ll need to cancel before the subscriptions start). You will need to enter your details, but since you can sign in with Apple you can avoid sharing your email address, which is nice. It\u2019s web-based, although there is an iOS app you can use. You can add and edit existing text, copy and paste, and add images to the PDF. It\u2019s also possible to add a signature \u2013 which is even electronically verified. You can easily combine multiple PDFs in one file. You can save your PDFs and collaborate with others while editing. If you are working as part of a team the lock and encryption options will be useful. It is even possible to create and host fillable forms that multiple users can fill in, and you can export the data added. Plus it is possible to convert documents from Word, JPG, Excel, PowerPoint and so on and create PDFs from them. If you want to open up the whole app to use then you\u2019ll need to sign up to a subscription. At the time of writing this costs $8 (\u00a36.14) a month for the Basic version or $20 (\u00a315.36) a month if you want to be able to cancel before the end of the first year. Read our full pdfFiller review\n\nFree PDF editors to avoid\n\nSometimes a free product just isn\u2019t worth the hassle. We\u2019ve looked at some options that we simply don\u2019t recommend.\n\nSwifDoo\n\nWe looked at SwifDoo, a free to download PDF reader. Apple\u2019s built-in Preview app performs most of the tasks offered, including proper PDF editing, which SwifDoo doesn\u2019t do. But more concerning is the fact that the app collects users\u2019 location data and uses it to track them, as outlined in the client\u2019s listing on Apple\u2019s App Store. Our research indicates that SwifDoo PDF seems to collect a broader range of data than some other options out there. There\u2019s absolutely no excuse for a PDF editing app to collect and use this kind of information.

            "content": "Adobe Systems (ADBE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -13.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has lost 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Adobe is expected to post earnings of $4.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.38 points to a change of +10.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.06 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Welcome to Tooltip Tuesday for Adobe Premiere Pro on ProVideoCoalition.\n\nLast week, Scott and Jeff showed what features they were most thankful for in the 2024 updates.\n\nIn this last post on New Year\u2019s Eve, we are doubling up again on what we\u2019re most excited about and looking forward to in the next year.\n\nMuch of the Adobe future is plotted out in their public betas available through the Creative Cloud application. You can install these concurrently with your existing version of Adobe apps. Both of us are updating the betas of Premiere Pro (and Media Encoder, Audition, Photoshop, and After Effects) on a daily basis\n\nYou can find a list of the What\u2019s New in Beta by clicking on the Laboratory Beaker icon in the top right of Premiere Pro.\n\nWe don\u2019t feel these versions are safe for production environments but rather allow you to play with the new tools early.\n\nWhat is Jeff looking forward to?\n\nThis was a very hard choice for me.\n\nI\u2019m a hundred percent going to cheat and tell you that my list of what I\u2019m excited about includes key functional Improvements (multi-threaded audio conforming, Open Timeline Import and Export (OTIO), and the New Color management) along with the potential of AI features (The new search panel with Visual Search, Generative Clip Extension and Smart Masking.)\n\nBut I have to pick one \u2013 and my criteria is to pick the one that I think will make the greatest difference in everyday editing. (This is my rule \u2013 Scott may pick a feature for different reasons!)\n\nIf Adobe can nail it, it\u2019s going to be Generative Extend.\n\nThere are tricks we\u2019ve learned when the footage is just too short. Generative Extend can add up to 2 seconds at the front and end of a clip. Any clip.\n\nIt could be a moment before an actor speaks. It could be just extending that pan just a little longer. It could be taking that small snippet of room tone and extending it. Generative Extend will handle audio with some key restrictions about music and speech.\n\nThis is the one feature I see myself using in every edit to get the timing of moments right to give me that extra beat that the source footage doesn\u2019t have. Whether it\u2019s for narrative or documentary work, I can\u2019t wait to make this part of my everyday editorial.\n\nNevertheless, every single one of the features I mentioned above is crazy useful. This is the one that I keep finding myself wanting to go back to old edits to make adjustments.\n\nThe caveat will be how clients/audiences will feel knowing that the material will have some AI-generated content and the authenticity of editorial intention. But that\u2019s a topic for a different discussion.\n\nWhat is Scott looking forward to?\n\nWhile I have to agree with Jeff that Generative Extend is a pretty amazing offering coming in the next year (Did you read about my Burning Questions about Generative Extend?), the particular item that I\u2019m looking forward to is rather small in execution but large in functionality. I\u2019m really looking forward to dynamic waveforms making their appearance in the shipping version of Premiere. Dynamic waveforms are now available in the Premiere beta, and they give you real-time feedback on the waveform scaling of your audio clips in the Premiere timeline.\n\nThis makes the most sense when you see them in action.\n\nAs you see in the gif above, as you adjust audio keyframe levels, the waveforms will scale up or down to reflect the volume change that you\u2019ve made. And this doesn\u2019t work with just \u201crubber band\u201d key-framing. Dynamic waveforms are reflected in most places that you can change the volume in Premiere. Such as, the Essential Sound Panel, Effects Controls, the New Properties panel or applying clip-level audio gain. It\u2019s simple, useful, very responsive and will be a much-welcome addition to Adobe Premiere Pro when it ships to the full release in 2025.\n\nThis series is courtesy of Adobe.",

            "content": "Russian energy company Gazprom said it would pump a reduced volume of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, the last day before the expiry of a deal that had kept the gas flowing throughout nearly three years of war.\n\nBarring a last-minute surprise deal, gas flows are likely to stop on Jan. 1 after the expiry of the five-year transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine, marking an almost complete loss of Moscow's once mighty hold over the European gas market.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 there was no time left this year to sign a new deal on the transit of gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe remaining buyers of Russian gas such as Slovakia and Austria have arranged for alternative supplies and analysts foresee minimal market impact from the Russian gas flow stoppage.\n\nThe price at the Title Transfer Facility, a virtual trading point in the Netherlands that is used as a benchmark for European natural gas prices, rose only slightly on Tuesday to 48.85 euros per megawatt hour by late morning.\n\nStopping the gas flow would have a much bigger geopolitical significance.\n\nMoscow has lost its dominant share of gas supplies to countries in the European Union to rivals such as the United States, Qatar and Norway since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the EU to cut its dependence on Russian gas.\n\nOnce the world's biggest gas exporter, state-controlled Gazprom recorded a $7 billion loss in 2023 alone, its first annual loss since 1999.\n\nFor Europe, the loss of cheap Russian gas supplies contributed to a major economic slowdown, a spike in inflation and a worsening of a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nWhile Europe has been quick to find alternative energy sources, the loss of Russian gas has exacerbated long-term concerns about its declining global competitiveness and in particular about Germany's industrial future.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact Of Ukraine War\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia and the Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at 35%, but the war in Ukraine has all but destroyed that business for Gazprom.\n\nMost Russian gas routes to Europe are shut, including Yamal-Europe via Belarus and Nord Stream under the Baltic that was blown up in 2022.\n\nThe Soviet-era pipeline via Ukraine brings gas from Siberia via the town of Sudzha - now under the control of Ukrainian soldiers - in Russia's Kursk region. It then flows through Ukraine to Slovakia. In Slovakia, the gas pipeline splits into branches going to the Czech Republic and Austria.\n\nKyiv has refused to negotiate a new transit deal.\n\nUkraine is giving up some $800 million a year in fees from Russia, while Gazprom will lose close to $5 billion in gas sales to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nThe end of the transit deal is unlikely to cause a repeat of the 2022 EU gas price rally as the remaining volumes are relatively small.\n\nRussia shipped about 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas via Ukraine in 2023 - only 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe via various routes in 2018-2019.\n\nGazprom said it would send 37.2 million cubic metres on Tuesday compared to 42.4 mcm on Monday.\n\nThe halting of supplies via Ukraine will be a major blow to Moldova, a country that was once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nHungary will continue to receive Russian gas from the south, via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea, although it had been keen to keep the Ukrainian route as well.\n\n($1 = 0.9601 euros)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reuters - Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Marina Bobrova; additional reporting by Jason Hovet in Prague; Writing by Nina Chestney; Editing by Mark Trevelyan, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Kirsten Donovan and Timothy Heritage)",

And speaking of AI: Adobe now also offers easy AI image generation features right in Adobe Acrobat, too.\n\nAdobe is using GPT 4o technology here, which means it\u2019s the same generative AI (genAI) tech that powers both ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot.\n\nAs an alternative, it\u2019s worth noting that you can also provide ChatGPT itself with PDF files and ask questions about them directly using that service. If you\u2019re already a big ChatGPT user who pays $20 a month for ChatGPT Plus and you have a workflow that works well with it, Adobe\u2019s Acrobat AI Assistant might not be quite as tempting.\n\nBut for people who use Acrobat at work, that extra $5 add-on fee to gain an AI assistant built right into the same application could be an enticing option.\n\nHow the Acrobat AI Assistant chatbot works\n\nThe Acrobat AI Assistant is easy to use and find: Just open a PDF in Adobe Acrobat or Reader. Then, click the colorful \u201cAI Assistant\u201d button on the toolbar. Adobe\u2019s AI chatbot will open in a sidebar, providing you with a summary of the document and suggesting questions. You can also click a \u201cGenerative Summary\u201d button in the All Tools sidebar to immediately get a summary of your document.\n\nAdobe\u2019s AI chatbot is always just one click away. Chris Hoffman, IDG\n\nIt works with PDFs up to 600 pages long, and you can use the \u201cAdd files\u201d button to add additional PDFs into the mix. In total, you can provide the Adobe AI Assistant with up to 10 PDF files at a time. Then you can ask questions and get answers based on all the files you provided.\n\nIn my experience, the Acrobat AI Assistant works well, by and large. That\u2019s no surprise, since it\u2019s using GPT 4o technology under the hood. It provides answers very similar to what you\u2019d get from ChatGPT \u2014 which is exactly what people who want AI integration in a productivity app are looking for.\n\nOne thing that really jumped out at me is that the Acrobat AI Assistant gives you the ability to fact check its answers. This is a critical capability with AI, which notoriously has a tendency to spew out inaccurate info at times. The Acrobat AI Assistant provides easily identifiable sources, pointing to specific pages where it found pieces of information.\n\nThat means it\u2019s not just a tool that will do all the work for you \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful research assistant that can sift through information and let you confirm it\u2019s actually getting things right.\n\nThe AI Assistant provides suggested questions, but you can ask anything you like. Chris Hoffman, IDG\n\nAcrobat AI and Adobe Firefly\n\nSpeaking of AI, Adobe Acrobat also has built-in access to Adobe Firefly, Adobe\u2019s genAI image model. You can right-click right in a PDF and select Add Image > Generate Image to open the Adobe Express interface in Acrobat. Then you can quickly generate and insert an image. You can also use this to replace an existing image in a PDF.\n\nOnce again, it works well, which is no surprise: Adobe\u2019s Firefly is a capable image generator.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Firefly image generation model is just a few clicks away, too. Chris Hoffman, IDG\n\nThe value of integration\n\nWhether it\u2019s the chatbot that uses the same underlying technology as ChatGPT or the Adobe Firefly-powered image insertion features, one thing is clear: Adobe\u2019s aim here is all about integration. Adobe isn\u2019t delivering any new and unheard-of AI features; rather, it\u2019s bringing all that power directly into a tool you already rely on during your workday.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad thing \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s a good one: By integrating AI chatbots and image generation tools into a standard business productivity tool, Adobe makes it easy to access those features and reduces the friction of having to copy-paste text and images between multiple tools just to get things accomplished.\n\nThat sort of polished package is especially important for businesses, as Adobe promises to safeguard data privacy and prevent all info from being used to train AI models. Most businesses don\u2019t want their employees providing business data to consumer AI tools, as it\u2019s often unclear whether that data is protected in the same way. In other words, copy-pasting business data into external AI tools doesn\u2019t just make for an inconvenient workflow \u2014 it\u2019s potentially dangerous for sensitive business data.\n\nFor Acrobat AI Assistant for enterprise customers, Adobe has a detailed document describing how it uses and respects customer data.\n\nPlus, since Adobe\u2019s assistant is also available as an add-on for the Adobe Reader application, organizations can easily roll out the chatbot even to employees who don\u2019t need the full-fledged Acrobat program.\n\nThe future of AI in Acrobat\n\nAdobe sees this current assistant as the first step in a long plan to bring useful AI tools into the Acrobat environment. An Adobe representative tells me \u201cthe [current] features are just the beginning of Adobe\u2019s vision to leverage generative AI to reimagine the value of documents for Acrobat customers.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Adobe says it plans to enable \u201cAI-powered authoring, editing, and formatting\u201d in Acrobat before long. This includes the ability to have AI generate first drafts, copy-edit, rewrite text, and suggest layout options for documents.\n\nIn addition, Adobe has plans to use AI for collaboration in Acrobat: Adobe\u2019s generative AI will analyze feedback and comments, suggest changes, and help deal with conflicting pieces of feedback.\n\nIt\u2019s something I expect to see more of \u2014 not just in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, but across all productivity apps. As these technologies grow more mature, we\u2019re learning how they\u2019re best used for professional purposes \u2014 and they\u2019re increasingly being built right into the business applications we use every day with those same sorts of purposes in mind.\n\nInterested in timely updates on what\u2019s going on in Windows \u2014 including with AI?

            "content": "Audio editing can be a challenge, but mastering Adobe Audition can save you time and make your projects shine. Whether you\u2019re cleaning up a podcast or working on a wedding video, having the right techniques in your toolbox can make all the difference.\n\nComing to you from Mike Russell, this practical video begins with tips on shortcuts and fast editing techniques. Learning to navigate with JKL keys for shuttle speed and configuring settings for playback can drastically speed up your workflow. Russell also shows how to declutter the multi-track interface using Shift + E, focusing your view on active tracks. These small adjustments save time and reduce distractions while editing. The ripple delete function is another good tool to know. Instead of manually deleting and shifting clips to close gaps, one command aligns your tracks instantly, streamlining dialogue edits.\n\nThe spectral view, introduced in this video, is an essential tool. It provides a detailed heat map of audio frequencies, allowing you to spot specific sounds like sibilance or unwanted noise. This view goes beyond the basic waveform, giving you more precision when fixing audio issues. For example, Russell demonstrates using this tool to identify background noise in quiet moments. Combining spectral editing with advanced noise reduction tools can eliminate these distractions without overly processing the audio. These techniques are particularly useful for improving the quality of spoken word recordings, such as interviews.\n\nBatch processing is another feature worth exploring. Russell shows how to handle multiple files at once, whether normalizing volumes, applying presets, or converting formats. This is ideal for projects involving repetitive tasks, like ensuring uniformity in voiceover recordings. The ability to save custom presets for effects and batch apply them simplifies what could otherwise be a tedious, manual process.\n\nMarkers and auto-healing tools round out the tips. Markers help keep projects organized, letting you pinpoint areas for edits or highlight important sections during recording. You can even use them to create ranges for more detailed annotations. Auto-heal, similar to Photoshop\u2019s spot healing, is a quick way to fix pops and plosives in spectral view. These tools cut down editing time and improve the overall flow of your sessions. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Russell.",

Well, it's not bad news.\n\n\"We\u2019re standing on the threshold of a transformative moment in generative AI,\" he tells me, revealing we're about to see a \"shift from the prompt-based era to a controls era\". This, adds Alexandru, is \"set to unleash human creativity in unimaginable ways\".\n\nThe current norm for using AI art generators is to type prompts into its UI 'ask' the algorithm to create an image, video or 3D object. It removes artistic input. Those artists who do use AI image generators have been trying to find ways to take back control, as Martin Nebelong explains in his op ed, 'AI art is only a threat if we let \"prompt-jockeys\" take control'. This is where Alexandru sees the future is for gen AI, in giving artists greater control over gen AI's output.\n\nAdobe predicts the 'Controls Era'\n\n\"Think of these 'controls' as the digital equivalent of the paintbrush in Photoshop,\" says Alexandru. \"This tool once seemed threatening to traditional art forms but ultimately sparked an explosion of creativity, craftsmanship, and innovation. Photoshop didn\u2019t replace physical paintbrushes; it redefined what was possible, opening new avenues for precision, taste and expression.\"\n\nHe adds: \"The controls era in AI marks a transformative shift, equipping creators with tools that unlock unprecedented creative possibilities. These tools go beyond mere task automation \u2013 they empower creators to refine, adapt, and reimagine their work across countless mediums, enabling deeper exploration of intricate details. Most importantly, because they reduce the barriers to taking creative risks, they encourage boundary-pushing innovation that leads to better solutions.\"\n\n(Image credit: Adobe)\n\nI saw this new direction for myself at this year's Adobe MAX, where new announcements focused on AI as tools rather than gimmicks. New tools like Project Turntable, that enables you to easily rotate 2D vector art in 3D by generating the missing data to fill in the image - a 2D horse now has four legs as its turned.\n\nThe theme of the Adobe MAX Sneaks I witnessed continued this trend towards AI with control and purpose; Project Scenic really is an AI tool designed to give back control - it turns an AI generated image into a 3D scene and regenerations are made manually through camera moves, edits and framing. And, of course, there's Project Concept AI that is a canvas for gen AI images, where you can collaborate to rework, edit and refine AI art, and set style guides to control the outputs.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

            "content": "stock.adobe.com\n\nSince it's implementation in 1992, the aim of the 340B Drug Pricing Program has been to offer low-income and underserved patient populations with cancer and other diseases expanded access to affordable medications by selling drugs at discounted prices to eligible centers.1 However, a lack of clarity among these centers has contributed to the program not operating at the peak of its potential in recent years, according to Aaron Ambrad, MD.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is a lot of money sitting on the table [in terms of] 340B\n\nreform, with some estimates up to [approximately] $84 billion in potential savings,\u201d Ambrad, a radiation oncologist at Ironwood Cancer & Research Centers in Scottsdale, Arizona, and a member of the Community Oncology Alliance (COA) board of directors, said in an interview with OncologyLive. The American Hospital Association relies on the 340B program significantly; [however], we believe there are a lot of abuses [of the program]. They say that it\u2019s a good program and it is doing what it\u2019s intended to do. We believe it\u2019s doing a lot more than it was intended to do, which is padding the pockets of these hospitals.\u201d\n\nParticipation in the 340B program has experienced significant growth since its inception. There were approximately 1000 covered entities in 1992; in 2021 this figure was over 50,000; 60% were hospitals and 40% were federal grantee clinics.1 More than 40% of US hospitals now participate in the 340B program. The discounted prices offered by the program are equivalent to the average manufacturer price minus the average Medicaid rebate for a unit of that drug during the previous quarter, conferring a discount of approximately 20% to 50% for participating hospitals.\n\nBeyond the rapid growth of the program, research has shown that the patient populations served by 340B program member hospitals have also shifted over time. Findings from a retrospective study published in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that before 2004 participating hospitals were larger (439 beds vs 338 beds), more often public (51.4% vs 11.0%), academic (67.9% vs 18.2%), located in counties with lower income levels (18.0% vs 15.0%), and serving higher levels of uninsured patients (14.0% vs 12.0%) compared with hospitals who joined the program after 2004.2\n\nIncreased participation in the program has led to increased profits for centers. Findings from a cross-sectional descriptive study of 340B revenue from Medicare spanning 2013 to 2016 demonstrated that hospitals received approximately $2.1 billion in revenue from Medicare in 2013 and $3.7 billion in 2016.3 The 2016 median per-hospital profits from the 340B program were estimated to be $0.8 million (IQR, $0.1 million-$2.8 million). Data from another study estimated that the 340B program generated more than $40 billion in total profits for covered entities, contract pharmacies, and potentially patients via reduced drug prices.4\n\nAmbrad says the deviation from the program\u2019s intended purpose by participating centers is largely due to a lack of transparency regarding profits and the rapid consolidation of smaller clinics by larger health care systems.\n\n\u201cOur biggest contention is that [health care center] consolidation is what happened with 340B. Over the past 10 years, [340B] hospitals started buying up rural programs, and there is a whole transparency issue of whether this is being policed and whether the oversight is there [to ensure] they are using 340B in the way it was intended,\u201d Ambrad explained.\n\nFrom 2016 through 2022, research showed that among 52 unique hospitals that were sold and 49 unique hospitals that bought another hospital, 81.6% of buying hospitals were 340B-covered entities.5 This consolidation shifts care delivery from community-based practices to hospital outpatient sites, potentially increasing the cost of care for patients. Importantly, similar consolidation has also been reported in terms of non-340B hospitals and oncology practices, so its precise association with the program has yet to be clearly defined.1\n\nThis consolidation of smaller centers into larger hospital systems and the funneling of care into hospitals have led to unintended downstream effects, according to Ambrad. Hospitals represent the most expensive part of the health care system and often provide no additional services for the average patient that can\u2019t be performed by a community practice, he said. In addition, there are often fees charged in the hospital setting that do not accompany care in the community setting, he said.\n\n\u201cThe discount [that hospitals] get with the 340B program is supposed to only apply to indigent care. An 11.75% [share of patients receiving indigent care] is required, which amounts to approximately 27% of your patients being on Medicaid or uninsured,\u201d Ambrad said. \u201cWe believe that they\u2019re funneling this benefit to all the hospitals. One hospital buys all [of a] drug for the whole system at a discount, which is totally unfair, with discounts up to 50% [leading to] huge markups. There needs to be reform and more oversight transparency. There apparently are no rules as to what they can do with this money that they\u2019re saving; they\u2019re supposed to give it back to the patient, but that apparently is not the case.\u201d\n\nFindings from a 2022 COA study showed that self-reported pricing\n\ndata from 340B hospitals revealed that top oncology drugs were priced\n\nat a median of 4.9 times higher compared with their 340B acquisition costs, with the lowest median markup being 3.2 times for tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) and the highest being 11.3 times for fulvestrant (Faslodex).6 The median markup between biosimilars and their reference products was approximately 5.5 times higher.\n\nAmbrad and other investigators are hoping that legislative action can be taken to increase the transparency of member institutions of the 340B program. In May 2024, US Representatives Earl L. \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter (R, Georgia); Larry Bucshon, MD, (R, Indiana); and Diana Harshbarger (R, Tennessee) introduced the 340B Affording Care for Communities and Ensuring a Strong Safety-Net Act (340B ACCESS Act).7 The bill aims to establish oversight and transparency concerning the 340B program and provide practical and achievable solutions to ensure the program works as intended. The bill calls for the establishment of patient affordability requirements, codifying of patient definition, recognition of contract pharmacies, imposing of hospital eligibility, establishment of child site eligibility, and restriction of pharmacy benefit managers and for-profit entities.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of bipartisan movement, [and we are] getting the ear [of legislators] to listen to exactly what we believe the main issues [with the 340B program] are,\u201d Ambrad said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the senators to understand [our problems with the program], but lobbying\n\nis always a big issue. There are real-world effects on a community practice such as ours, and [these issues] start to destroy the independent, physician-run practice.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "The past several years have been a period of extreme volatility for the trucking industry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, snarled supply chains sent freight rates and the number of trucking companies surging upward. But rates started plunging in 2022, which sent the industry into a long and painful freight recession. While it looks like the industry is finally emerging from this recession, the path to recovery and growth will be a long one.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that carriers face a wide range of urgent challenges: overcapacity due to the spike in supply during the pandemic, less predictable freight cycles and a sluggish recovery in freight prices. Although many carriers have built up their cash reserves in recent years \u2014 which should help them survive as the industry emerges from the freight recession \u2014 they will contend with narrow margins and other financial obstacles for the foreseeable future. Carriers also have to navigate a changing operational landscape, from an industry-wide digital transformation to the management of distributed teams.\n\nThe trucking industry will continue its long march out of the freight recession in 2025 \u2014 demand is on the rise and rates appear to have bottomed out. However, carriers shouldn\u2019t be expecting a quick turnaround. This means they will have to focus on efficiency, leverage new technologies such as AI-powered automation that will help them manage their fleets more effectively, and consider new forms of workforce management. While a gradual recovery can be frustrating, the strategic decisions carriers make now will have implications for years.\n\nPrediction #1: Carriers will Confront a Slow Recovery\n\nAfter the trucking boom during the pandemic, freight volumes fell precipitously in late 2022. Beyond the inevitable pullback after rates exploded so quickly, there were structural economic issues that triggered the freight recession. The latest U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index cited a \u201cslowdown in the goods economy, including slowing household consumption of goods, home construction activity, and manufacturing output.\u201d Between the second half of 2023 and the first quarter of this year, shipments dropped an average of 7.4% quarterly.\n\nWhile the number of new monthly carriers was roughly flat between the middle of 2015 and 2020, this number more than tripled in less than a year after the beginning of the pandemic. This number remained extremely elevated for years, and it\u2019s still above where it was pre-COVID. However, when supply chains normalized and rates collapsed, many of these upstarts were suddenly in a precarious financial position. Over 95% of carriers operate ten or fewer trucks, and these small operations have less of a financial safety net than their larger peers.\n\nBecause many carriers saw a huge influx of business during the pandemic, they still have the savings they need to maintain operations as the freight recession finally comes to an end. Now is the time for carriers of all sizes to make strategic investments that will position themselves for long-term growth as their industry recovers.\n\nPrediction #2: Industry Leaders will Focus on Digital Transformation\n\nAlthough we\u2019re in the middle of the busiest season of the year for carriers, the industry still isn\u2019t seeing significant volume and rate increases. This is yet another reminder that the road out of the freight recession will be long. But this doesn\u2019t mean carriers should resign themselves to slow growth and thin margins \u2014 they should instead explore new processes and technologies that will help them operate more efficiently, improve visibility and data management and better adapt to shifting economic conditions and freight cycles.\n\nThere are many ways for carriers to streamline fleet management, workflows, communications, and other operations to decrease costs and improve performance. For example, instead of using siloed technology solutions which limit visibility and make processes more disjointed, carriers can implement unified software platforms that facilitate communication, collaboration, and data sharing across the company. These platforms have never been more accessible or powerful than they are now (thanks to AI), which is particularly valuable for the smaller carriers that have limited IT budgets and make up a disproportionate share of the industry.\n\nAccording to Accenture, trucking lags other industries in the freight and logistics sector in digital maturity. Although carriers have implemented tools such as app-based driver management systems, the proportion of their IT spend dedicated to innovation is below the sector average. At a time when many carriers are sitting on abnormally large cash reserves left over from the pandemic boom, they should be directing these funds toward digital tools and other resources that will help them cut costs and improve productivity over the long run.\n\nPrediction #3: Efficiency will be a Core Priority\n\nWith the consequences of the freight recession still clearly visible on carriers\u2019 balance sheets, it has never been more important for carriers to prioritize efficiency. There are many ways carriers can pursue this goal. Beyond the adoption of cloud-native technology for fleet management, communications, and data analysis, carriers should consider strategies that address multiple problems at once \u2014 such as inefficient operations and the rising demand for greater sustainability from customers and regulators.\n\nOver the next few years, carriers will confront increasingly strict emissions regulations and growing public pressure to operate more sustainably. Carriers shouldn\u2019t just view these developments as obstacles \u2014 they should treat them as opportunities to improve efficiency across the board. For example, by prioritizing route optimization, they can reduce mileage by 15 to 30%. There\u2019s no reason 20 to 35% of trucking miles should be empty. Freight pooling can cut down on waste and reduce carriers\u2019 environmental impact, and this strategy is especially important when there\u2019s a surplus of trucks in the industry.\n\nToo many carriers are still using outdated logistics tools for everything from workflows to fleet management. These tools are often siloed and cumbersome, and they aren\u2019t up to the task of managing modern distributed workforces. As more carriers rely on distributed teams, it\u2019s critical to have a single comprehensive platform for everything from driver dispatch to load management to accounting. AI has a major role to play in everything from automating backend operations to data analysis, which will decrease the size of workforces, improve visibility, and help carriers conduct strategic planning.\n\nWith the effects of the freight recession still lingering and a long recovery ahead, carriers need to become leaner and more intelligent about how they manage their fleets. By making pivotal investments in technology and other drivers of efficiency now, carriers will ensure that they\u2019re prepared for whatever the future might bring.",

            "content": "The invention and development of the commercial airliner remains to me one of humanity\u2019s most incredible achievements. In an age of seismic shifts in technological capability, the idea that one can have breakfast in Paris and dinner in New York on the same calendar day is almost banal. And yet, the progression of air travel over the past 100+ years can provide a guide for how we must consider the paradigm shift we\u2019re currently experiencing with generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nPlane Travel, From Cutting-Edge Spectacle to Everyday Convenience\n\nSince the first commercial flight occurred more than 110 years ago, the technology powering air travel has advanced dramatically. Today, when you board a flight, much of the experience is handled by the plane\u2019s autopilot system, optimizing routes, managing safety, and tracking complex sensors and analytics throughout the aircraft.\n\nSo, what are the pilots there for? They are still very often manually taking off and landing the aircraft (an important job to be sure), monitoring conditions onboard and in the sky, and, crucially, taking over the controls midflight should the situation call for it.\n\nAlthough modern flight is highly automated, pilots still know how to fly the planes when they need to. I imagine we all would prefer to sit on a plane with a pilot who could take over the controls in an emergency rather than one who was just good at understanding how the autopilot functions.\n\nBecoming a commercial pilot in the United States requires at least 1,500 hours of experience, exams and licensures, and a love of the skies. And that passion \u2014 even obsession \u2014 for aviation is crucial to keeping us safe in the air.\n\nInnovation Requires a Deep Appreciation for Craft\n\nThe concept of \u201ccraft\u201d has been dissected and debated for centuries. Philosophers like Plato and Socrates thought deeply about the role that craft plays in our sense of self and in driving society forward. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nAristotle included craft (which he called \u201ctechn\u00ea\u201d) as one of his five virtues of thought, defining it as \u201ca disposition that produces something by way of true reasoning; it is concerned with the bringing into existence of things that could either exist or not.\u201d\n\nPut differently, craft is more about making new things than simply doing work that must be done.\n\nI\u2019m certainly no philosopher, but over the course of my career, I\u2019ve interviewed and spent time with many impressive leaders from a variety of fields of study. And while there is no single recipe for their success, one common theme rings true: They are all students of their respective crafts.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\nFrom medicine to public policy, to art forms like film or music, the people we most admire often retain an unparalleled knowledge of their discipline, from the history of their industries to the notable individuals and innovations that have brought it into a modern context. Beyond this deep knowledge is a deep appreciation for their field of work, and it is only through this level of commitment to the craft that innovation continues to march forward as generations build knowledge on top of one another.\n\nCraft, Democratized\n\nAI is undoubtedly disrupting this handoff, quickening the pace of knowledge transfer, and thus innovation, to a blistering speed. Surely this is a good thing for our collective society. Related Content\n\nStill, as more people gain the ability to contribute ideas and creations to the cultural zeitgeist, we must intentionally protect the magic of craft lest it erode entirely in favor of distribution and quantity of information. Rather than accept a future in which all creative output is a constant re-creation made through AI-churn \u2014 where we, in fact, rediscover the same ideas again and again \u2014 we should pursue a future where those well-versed in the history and innovative present of their craft can help drive our vision for the future.\n\nIn all forms, craft is contagious. Have you ever watched someone in flow, perfecting a sculpture, plating a favorite recipe, or explaining their love of astrology? The energy that humans bring to their craft is undeniable, often transcending their message and helping unlock new ideas in unrelated disciplines. We appreciate great art because we can see in the brush strokes or in the intricate details of the craftsmanship that were applied to it.\n\nCraft is the connective tissue of our history, weaving itself through each iteration and enabling new players to interpret it in novel ways. Technology, when applied well, reduces toil but doesn\u2019t reduce our passion for the work.\n\nIn typography, for instance, typesetters were so named because they would manually set lead type in a printing press, painstakingly kerning the letters one by one to ensure they were spaced appropriately. Today, this work is mostly done in digital environments, and yet, like pilots, the best designers still understand the role that typography plays and the importance of good character spacing and font pairing in achieving the desired voice and message.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAI is already matching, in some areas, the abilities of human intelligence. Yet it is devoid of the craft that represents such an important piece of innovation. New advancements in technology have enabled more people to express their passions across more mediums and in more affordable ways. In this new era, where everyone can contribute, those who study and pursue their craft will continue to see the most transformational results.",
