It showcased a new version of the AI assistant Quark app in March.\n\nAfter grappling with domestic regulatory crackdowns, leadership reshuffles, and collapsing market confidence, Alibaba stock noted a turnaround. A rallying call from co-founder Jack Ma in late 2023 helped ignite a turnaround that has pushed the company\u2019s U.S.-listed shares up 56% year-to-date, adding more than $100 billion to its valuation.\n\nUnder the leadership of Eddie Wu and Joe Tsai, the company has since leaned into artificial intelligence.\n\nThe return of Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma to public view, particularly during a meeting with President Xi Jinping in February, signaled improved relations between Alibaba and China\u2019s leadership.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities called Alibaba the \u201cbest way to play China tech,\u201d citing its strong positioning in AI and cloud.\n\nPrice Action: BABA stock is down 3.15% at $125.70 premarket at last check Wednesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto by jackpress via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Models from Alibaba (Qwen) and DeepSeek AI have consistently demonstrated performance comparable to AI models developed in the United States.\n\nChina represents a challenging market for NVIDIA to export GPUs because of restrictions imposed by the United States government.\n\nAfter the US implemented export restrictions on NVIDIA\u2019s high-end GPUs, the company introduced a less powerful version of its Hopper GPU, the H20, to legally export it to China.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg reported in January that officials from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration are also in discussions to restrict the export of H2O chips. Therefore, if NVIDIA were to ship the chips to China, it would need to do so before any further restrictions come into effect.\n\nA report from Reuters last month revealed that Chinese companies are increasing their orders for NVIDIA\u2019s H20 chip to satisfy the growing demand for DeepSeek\u2019s affordable models.\n\nFurthermore, as per a report last December, Omdia estimated that ByteDance and Tencent each ordered approximately 2,30,000 NVIDIA chips for 2024. It was also reported that DeepSeek possess around 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nThe Information also revealed that NVIDIA generated $17 billion in sales from China in the 12 months ending January 26, accounting for 13% of its total revenue.\n\nPreviously, NVIDIA shipped the H800 GPU, a less powerful version of the H100 GPU. The H100 offers a transfer rate of 600 gigabytes per second, compared to the H800\u2019s 300 gigabytes per second.\n\nSoon after, the US also banned the export of NVIDIA\u2019s H800 to China, preventing the company from selling chips even at a reduced transfer rate.",

Far from being of interest only to academics, this is a trillion-dollar question with profound implications for Chinese businesses and international investors. Indeed, China is the only country to have succeeded in fostering tech giants that can rival those of the United States. Companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Meituan, and Pinduoduo are among the world\u2019s top 10 largest internet firms in terms of market capitalization. In 2017, Tencent overtook Meta (then called Facebook) to become the world\u2019s fifth largest publicly traded company. China is also home to the largest unicorns (privately held startups worth over USD 1 billion) in the world. In 2020, the country boasted 227 unicorns, second only to the United States with 233. Of the world\u2019s top 10 unicorns in 2020, 6 came from China, with 4 Chinese companies topping the chart. For years, Chinese regulatory authorities have adopted a very lax and tolerant stance toward regulating its Big Tech, with the goal of cultivating tech titans capable of outperforming their foreign rivals.\n\nHowever, starting in October 2020, against the political backdrop of President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d campaign, Beijing has unleashed a seemingly unrelenting blizzard of regulatory measures against Chinese tech firms in areas ranging from antitrust to data and labor. This massive regulatory campaign started with the sudden debacle of Ant Group\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) and has since spread like wildfire, affecting a wide range of industries\u2014from fintech and e-commerce to social media, food delivery, ride-hailing, and even tutoring. In 2021, China\u2019s antitrust authority imposed a combined fine of USD 3.3 billion on Alibaba, the nation\u2019s largest e-commerce company, and Meituan, its largest fooddelivery company. That same year, the ride-hailing behemoth Didi found itself subject to a surprise cybersecurity review two days after its IPO listing in New York. Tencent, owner of the ubiquitous messaging app WeChat, also saw some of its mergers restricted or blocked. By March 2022, Chinese tech giants had suffered an extraordinary USD 2 trillion loss in value from their peak in early 2021, with shares of major tech firms such as Alibaba, Meituan, and Didi slumping more than 50 percent. Alarmed by these developments, and seeking to stave off further political pressure, Chinese tech bosses and digital giants are now funneling vast sums of money into socially beneficial projects and charities.\n\nChina\u2019s tech crackdown has also alarmed the White House. As the rising Asian economic superpower reorients its Big Tech firms toward developing more hardcore, cutting-edge technologies to stay competitive with the United States, profound questions have been raised about the future of the US\u2013China tech rivalry. Will Chinese national champions such as Tencent and Alibaba, which thrive on producing video games and selling clothes online, be able to help China close the technological gap with the United States? What might the future hold for Chinese tech firms eager to access the US capital market? At the time of writing, Chinese firms seeking to list in the United States are struggling to overcome strict cross-border datatransfer rules recently imposed by the Chinese government. A prominent example is Didi, which delisted from the United States\u2014vividly illustrating the intensity of the pressure exerted on domestic firms by China\u2019s cyber watchdog. In light of these developments, it is unsurprising that Chinese Big Tech regulation has garnered intense attention from the media, the business community, and academia. There is, however, no established consensus on how to interpret these trends. Two primary views have surfaced in response to the government\u2019s recent tech crackdown, representing critics and proponents of China\u2019s regulatory initiatives.\n\nCritics of China\u2019s regulatory campaign have mostly traced its underlying impetus to the politics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in particular the internal power struggle leading up to the 20th CCP Congress and the CCP\u2019s broader ambition to assert unbridled and pervasive control over Chinese society. Such critics are also alarmed by the common prosperity campaign, whose central ethos calls for a more equal distribution of wealth. They see China\u2019s recent regulatory actions as an attempt to roll back decades-long market reforms and restore the country\u2019s socialist roots, thereby fulfilling Mao Zedong\u2019s ultimate vision. Although some critics acknowledge the existence of sound regulatory logic underpinning the new measures, they remain skeptical about the underlying motivation of the crackdown. China experts Barry Naughton and Jude Blanchette underscore that China\u2019s income inequality is hardly a new issue, and regulatory gaps that exacerbate these disparities have existed for years. Pointing to the upcoming 20th CCP Congress as a determining factor, they suggest that the launch of this sudden and multifaceted legal campaign against tech firms was primarily driven by the desire of the Xi administration to give its cadres an opportunity \u201cto demonstrate their loyalty and competence.\u201d Overall, these critics cast a bleak outlook not only for China\u2019s tech sector, but for its economy as a whole, warning that the crackdown is driving China into the unknown and will strangle its greatest source of economic dynamism.\n\nOn the other hand, another group of observers views Chinese regulation in a more favorable light, viewing the latest measures as China\u2019s attempt to \u201ccatch up\u201d with the West by correcting the excesses of capital expansion. Thinkers in this camp believe that the Chinese government has been more responsive than its Western counterparts in curbing tech monopolies and their exploitation of the public. Indeed, the ongoing digital transformation of the world\u2019s societies and economies is posing unprecedented challenges for mankind: although innovation generally enhances productivity growth and social mobility, it has also become a source of income and wealth inequality. In the United States, superstar tech firms such as Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft have so pervasively invaded multiple sectors and product lines that they have discouraged other firms from entering the market, thus foreclosing potential avenues for innovation. The fact that yesterday\u2019s innovations can entrench today\u2019s incumbents demonstrates the power that tech giants have in deterring new entrants, thereby undermining productivity growth and social mobility in the long run. Such market dominance is particularly worrying as there is increasing evidence that big businesses are capturing Western governments, making it ever more difficult to push forward reforms. Prominent economists, including Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales, now call for protecting capitalism from the capitalists. This, however, is far from easy. As Katharina Pistor observes in The Code of Capital, the ultra-rich are adept at leveraging the highly complex legal codes of different jurisdictions to create, preserve, and pass on their wealth. The level of complexity in the interplay of state law and private legal ordering has led her to question whether the current form of global capitalism has become ungovernable. Similarly, David Ellwood, a Harvard economist, points out that even though many solutions have been proposed in the West, they all \u201cstumble on both the question of whether they can ever be achieved politically and whether the scale and speed of the changes are sufficient to achieve real changes in inequality.\n\nBoth of the above viewpoints\u2014that is, both critics and supporters of China\u2019s recent wave of tech regulation\u2014have their merits. However, neither viewpoint is complete. Critics are correct that the harsh regulatory crackdown has afforded the government a much greater regulatory arsenal, thus strengthening its grip over the tech sector. Critics also have good reasons to be concerned about the common prosperity campaign, which could curb entrepreneurial spirits and sap business confidence. But supporters are also rightly concerned about income inequality. China\u2019s transformation from a poor country into the world\u2019s second-largest economy brought a dramatic increase in its level of inequality. As China enters its own \u201cGilded Age,\u201d to borrow a term originally used to describe the late-nineteenth-century United States, inequality is becoming a worrying trend. China\u2019s Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has been hovering around 0.46 to 0.49 for decades, which is above the 0.40 red line for inequality. In 2015, those with incomes in the top 10 percent of China\u2019s earners accounted for approximately 41 percent of the total national income, while the top 1 percent accounted for around 14 percent, according to a study by Thomas Piketty and co-authors. Inequality in China is now worse than in Europe and is fast approaching the level seen in the United States. Indeed, China\u2019s wealth gap seems only to have widened in recent years, with the wealthiest 1 percent of Chinese people holding 30 percent of the country\u2019s wealth in 2020.\n\nFrom \u201cHigh Wire\u201d by Angela Huyue Zhang.

President Biden's administration is also considering imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said the company will move production to the U.S. in the long term but sees little immediate impact.\n\nChina remains a vital market for Nvidia, with the company reporting $17.11 billion in annual revenue from the region (including Hong Kong) in fiscal 2025.",

This collaboration reflects Alibaba\u2019s growing emphasis on AI applications and monetisation strategies, while highlighting BMW\u2019s commitment to creating competitive products for the Chinese market.\n\nThe collaboration will result in a new version of BMW\u2019s Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA), powered by a custom AI engine jointly developed by the two companies. This engine, based on Alibaba\u2019s Yan AI and Qwen major language model, will make its debut in BMW Neue Klasse models produced in China starting in 2026.\n\nThe AI-enhanced IPA aims to significantly improve in-car mobility services, including navigation, assistance functions and more natural voice interactions. The collaboration is in line with Alibaba\u2019s ambition to drive innovation through AI and BMW\u2019s goal to integrate AI into all its products.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW\u2019s Neue Klasse models will initially include two AI agents: Travel Companion and Car Genius. These agents can provide personalized lifestyle services and real-time assistance, such as dinner planning by taking into account restaurant reviews, traffic conditions and user preferences.\n\nSean Green, President and CEO of BMW Group Region China, emphasised the importance of cooperating with Chinese technology partners in advancing electric mobility and intelligent technologies. Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba Group, emphasized the central role AI plays in revolutionizing various industries, including mobility, by improving the user experience.\n\nBMW has actively invested in electric vehicles in recent years and is aiming for a significant share of all-electric vehicle sales. The company plans to introduce all-electric versions of major models by the early 2030s and fully electrify subsidiary brands such as Rolls-Royce and MINI Cooper.\n\nThe launch of the Neue Klasse is expected to play an important role in meeting BMW\u2019s goal of increasing the proportion of all-electric deliveries to 50% this year. Oliver Zipse, chairman of the management board of BMW AG, highlighted the company\u2019s progress in e-mobility and its commitment to offer a diverse range of electric vehicles for all its brands.\n\nHowever, European electric vehicle manufacturers are facing challenges due to weaker-than-expected demand and an increased focus on hybrid technology. Increasing competition from Chinese rivals such as BYD, SAIC and Geely, combined with lower government subsidies for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in several European countries, have contributed to an uncertain outlook for the EV sector.\n\nBusiness AM",

H3C, a key server manufacturer, highlighted the depletion of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip inventory, raising concerns about supply chain disruptions.\n\nChinese firms are exploring alternatives to reduce reliance on Nvidia. In March, Qingcheng.AI introduced \u201cChitu,\u201d a framework designed to operate on Chinese-made chips, aiming for technological self-sufficiency.\n\nHuawei Technologies has also been advancing its AI chip capabilities, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging the company's competitive edge.\n\nDespite these challenges, China remains a crucial market for Nvidia, contributing significantly to its revenue. In 2024, Nvidia generated $12 billion in revenue from China, selling twice as many AI chips as Huawei's Ascend 910B.\n\nPrice Action: Nvidia's stock has declined 20.16% year-to-date, but over the past 12 months, it has gained 24.12%, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nBenzinga Edge Stock Rankings gives Nvidia (NVDA) a 94.90% growth rating.

The four companies are expected to spend $320 billion in capital expenditures this year to broaden their AI capabilities.\n\nThe rush to build new data centers is also happening internationally, with investment funds and AI rivals pouring capital into the needed real estate and hardware.\n\nAlibaba, a popular Chinese e-commerce site that has jumped into AI development, will invest over $52 billion over the next three years, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBut the data center buildout is becoming indiscriminate, Tsai said, with companies seemingly developing the sites with hopes of future success. Some projects are occurring without \"uptake\" agreements.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec.\"\n\nThe numbers, at least those pushed by US firms, are also astounding to Tsai, who questioned the need for such spending.\n\n\"People are talking, literally talking about $500 billion, several 100 billion dollars. I don't think that's entirely necessary,\" he said. \"I think in a way, people are investing ahead of the demand that they're seeing today, but they are projecting much bigger demand.\"\n\nUS investors may be starting to share Tsai's cynicism. While massive spending by US Big Tech firms has been a point of strength in previous years, the need for such enormous capex has come under fire as cheaper AI models have emerged from China. Waning enthusiasm for AI has helped trigger a sell-off in stocks such as Nvidia.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

            "content": "Alibaba (BABA) stock has surged 52% this year but remains relatively undervalued, given the scope for further gains. That\u2019s the view coming from Mizuho Securities stock analyst James Lee. In a research note, Lee raised the firm\u2019s price target on Alibaba from $140 to $170 while reaffirming his outperform rating. The analyst cited BABA as having \u201crock-solid building blocks\u201d for artificial intelligence investments and foresees an \u201cincrease in productivity to enable improved product recommendations and conversions.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, the stock\u2019s rebound has been fueled by tangible business wins, from a resurgence in cloud computing to robust international growth and improved e-commerce efficiency. And yet, Alibaba shares still trade at a discounted valuation, matching the long-lasting disconnect between its underlying strength and market sentiment.\n\nIn the meantime, management\u2019s proactive moves, including aggressive buybacks and strategic asset sales, should bolster Wall Street\u2019s confidence in Alibaba\u2019s intrinsic value. For these reasons, I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nAI Lights Up the Cloud\n\nFor starters, one of the most notable wins Alibaba has achieved recently is regarding its Cloud Intelligence unit, which is back in the driver\u2019s seat and powered by a red-hot market appetite for AI services. In its latest report, cloud revenue kicked up 13% year-on-year, returning to double-digit territory after a sluggish stretch.\n\nThe highlight here is Alibaba\u2019s AI-driven cloud products, which posted triple-digit revenue growth for the sixth quarter running\u2014a clear sign that Alibaba wields significant tech muscle in the current AI boom. BABA\u2019s management is fully committed to keeping the company\u2019s momentum going. CEO Eddie Wu sounded downright giddy on the post-earnings call, saying AI-fueled cloud growth \u201cwill keep picking up speed.\u201d According to Main Street Data, BABA has been gradually diversifying its revenue sources over time. By the end of 2024, the e-commerce giant had seven different revenue sources (compared to just three in 2020), with six generating over $1 billion in Q4 2024.\n\nNote that Alibaba Cloud already rules China\u2019s market with about a 37% grip and is planting new data centers across Asia to push overseas. Better yet, profits are climbing fast as the focus shifts to higher-margin services, giving the cloud unit\u2019s bottom line a solid boost.\n\nInternational Sales Reinforce Revenue Growth\n\nAnother factor to consider is that Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce kingdom is no longer a China-only story. International retail revenue shot up over 30% to $5 billion in Q3, with AliExpress and Turkey\u2019s Trendyol leading the charge. Programs like AliExpress\u2019s Choice (think curated items with fast shipping) have lit a fire under user engagement and overseas orders.\n\nAlibaba is also cracking into fresh markets through value-accretive deals, such as a new joint venture to grow AliExpress in South Korea. Diversification-focused moves spread the revenue net wider and position Alibaba to capitalize on e-commerce opportunities in fast-growing regions well beyond its backyard.\n\nBABA\u2019s Customer Management Catalyst\n\nIn China, Alibaba\u2019s core commercialization efforts are humming. Management has been laser-focused on sprucing up the Taobao and Tmall experience for users and merchants alike, and it\u2019s paying off. Customer management revenue, including merchant ads and commissions, jumped 9% year-on-year last quarter, indicating that shopping is picking up.\n\nNotably, more orders and higher margins, helped by tricks like a 0.6% software fee and the AI-powered Quanzhantui marketing tool, drove the uptick. During its earnings conference call in February, BABA\u2019s CEO Eddie Wu noted that AI-related product revenue maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nOn the shopper side, folks are sticking around, as Alibaba\u2019s premium \u201988VIP\u2019 loyalty club just reached 49 million members, growing by double digits and locking in big spenders. By doubling down on better prices, services, and perks, Alibaba has sparked user growth without bleeding margins. In fact, the Chinese commerce arm bolstered its profits significantly. In many ways, Alibaba is delivering a masterclass in operational efficiency, thereby setting a benchmark that many of its U.S. peers struggle to match.\n\nValuation Gap and Capital Returns\n\nDespite all the good news, Alibaba\u2019s stock price remains discounted. After the rally, BABA trades at just 13x forward EPS, which seems like a steal compared to U.S. counterpart e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), which regularly command in excess of 30x. The recent stock sell-offs have reduced multiples somewhat, but U.S. tech equivalents to BABA remain more expensive.\n\nThe valuation gap is even harsher if you consider Alibaba\u2019s ever-strengthening shareholder returns. In the past year, it has repurchased $12 billion worth of stock (~5% of shares). Management even borrowed cash to buy back shares at $80, calling the purchase price \u201cway too cheap.\u201d According to recent commentary, there\u2019s still $20 billion greenlit for more buybacks, too. According to Main Street Data, BABA paid more in dividends and share buybacks than ever in Q3 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba\u2019s been offloading non-core assets, including stakes in brick-and-mortar retail chains, to tighten up and free up value. That kills the old rap that Chinese companies hoard cash instead of sharing it with shareholders.\n\nWhat is the Target Price for BABA Stock?\n\nOn Wall Street, there is unanimous consensus. BABA stock carries a Strong Buy rating based on 16 Buy ratings over the past three months. This is rather significant, considering the recent share price gains. It also aligns with my view regarding the possibility of further gains from the current levels. At $167.48 per share, the average BABA stock price target suggests a 28% upside potential.\n\nStars Align for BABA\u2019s Market Surge\n\nEverything\u2019s coming together for Alibaba with its superb cloud growth, a confident push into e-commerce, and the local China business firing on all cylinders again. Yet the company trades at a discount to its U.S. peers. Management is fully committed to the company, pouring cash into buybacks and shedding dead weight, showing they believe in its underlying value and future ventures yet to be unveiled.\n\nThe market has been sluggish in noting BABA\u2019s rise while U.S.-China relations remain strained, creating an opportunity for investors. With Alibaba gliding past significant commercial milestones yet rewarding shareholders, its bullish trend is only getting started.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

            "content": "Nvidia Faces Challenges As Alibaba Emerges As AI Leader Chinese tech giants order $16 billion in Nvidia chips while investors shift to Alibaba amid tariff concerns.\n\nNvidia Corporation has witnessed significant developments in its business and stock performance as we progress through 2025. The semiconductor giant continues to dominate the AI chip market but faces both opportunities and challenges in the current economic and geopolitical environment.\n\nChinese technology companies have shown tremendous appetite for Nvidia\u2019s AI hardware. ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Tencent Holdings placed at least $16 billion in orders for Nvidia\u2019s H20 server chips during the first quarter of 2025, according to a report from The Information. This surge in orders highlights the ongoing demand for AI infrastructure in China. The H20 chip represents Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI processor legally available in the Chinese market under current US export controls.\n\nThe H20 was specifically designed to comply with restrictions imposed in October 2023, which prevent the export of Nvidia\u2019s most cutting-edge chips to China based on concerns about potential military applications. Despite the strong demand, there are signs of potential supply constraints. H3C, one of China\u2019s largest server manufacturers, has warned about possible shortages of the H20 chip. This could create challenges for Chinese companies pursuing ambitious AI development plans.\n\nH3C serves as a major OEM partner for Nvidia in China, alongside other firms like Inspur, Lenovo, and xFusion. The potential supply crunch comes at a time when Chinese firms are rapidly expanding their investments in artificial intelligence technology. Companies are racing to develop and deploy AI models similar to those created by US firms. One example is DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that has generated significant interest with its low-cost AI models, helping drive demand for Nvidia\u2019s hardware in the region.\n\nWhile Chinese demand remains robust, some investors are reassessing their positions on Nvidia stock. Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, recently told CNBC that he had sold his Nvidia shares and purchased Alibaba stock instead. Jackson suggested that \u201cAlibaba is a better AI play than Nvidia at least through Q2 and maybe for the rest of the year.\u201d He cited concerns about Nvidia\u2019s recent technical performance, noting that the stock \u201chasn\u2019t been acting well since earnings.\u201d\n\nDespite these concerns, Jackson acknowledged that Nvidia remains \u201ca great company with great products\u201d and praised the company\u2019s product roadmap as \u201cfantastic.\u201d His preference for Alibaba appears to be more about relative value than fundamental problems at Nvidia.\n\nNvidia stock has struggled in early 2025, declining 18% since the beginning of the year through early April. This performance contrasts sharply with the company\u2019s stellar gains in previous years. A major factor weighing on Nvidia shares is uncertainty surrounding US trade policy. President Donald Trump announced plans in February to impose tariffs of approximately 25% on imports of semiconductors and related products.\n\nThe market has been awaiting details on these tariffs, with a formal announcement expected. This policy uncertainty has created headwinds for semiconductor stocks broadly, with Nvidia caught in the crossfire. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that the company anticipates minimal short-term impact from potential tariffs but would relocate production to the United States over the longer term if necessary.\n\nDespite the geopolitical complications, China remains a crucial market for Nvidia. The company reported annual revenue of $17.11 billion from the China region (including Hong Kong) in fiscal 2025. Analysts note that Nvidia\u2019s valuation has become more attractive amid the recent stock price decline. Shares currently trade at 23 times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, well below the five-year average multiple of 40 times.\n\nMelius Research analyst Ben Reitzes pointed out that consensus estimates for Nvidia\u2019s 2026 earnings have been revised upward by 37% since July 2024. However, the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect these improved expectations, suggesting market concerns about geopolitical factors. Industry observers note that strong demand for AI chips continues unabated.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently commented that his company is struggling to handle infrastructure demands from its popular image-generation tool and is seeking access to additional third-party chips. If semiconductor products are excluded from the upcoming tariff announcement, Nvidia shares could see a relief rally. However, this would likely depend on whether President Trump signals any intention for future actions targeting the chip sector specifically.\n\nIn contrast, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is currently perceived as a better pick to bet on continued momentum in artificial intelligence. Jackson\u2019s remarks arrive as Alibaba warms up to launching \u201cQwen 3\u201d by the end of April 2025. Jackson likes the Chinese e-commerce and tech behemoth also for the strength of its financials.\n\nIn February, Alibaba reported earnings for its third quarter that handily topped Street estimates. More importantly, the AI stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.51%, which makes it all the more exciting to own ahead of a potential recession. Investors should be pounding the table on Alibaba stock because it\u2019s a great way to avoid the tariff tantrum, according to Quint Tatro of Joule Financial.\n\nAlibaba generates as much as 90% of its revenue from China, with the US making up less than 5% of its annual sales. The Chinese giant plans on spending more than $50 billion on AI over the next three years, which may help unlock significant further upside in its share price.\n\nAlibaba has seen triple-digit growth in its AI revenue over the past six quarters. In its latest earnings release, Eddie Wu, the company\u2019s chief executive, told investors: \u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrated substantial progress in our user-first, AI-driven strategies and the reaccelerated growth of our core businesses.\u201d Following the news of an upgraded AI model coming soon, analysts at Mizuho raised their price target on Alibaba shares to $170 this week, which translates to about a 35% upside from current levels.\n\nAll in all, while Alibaba stock has rallied hard in recent months, experts seem to be keeping bullish, calling for further upside as we advance through this year.",

Still, this recent rally doesn't deter Tatro, who highlighted the name as a buy for its tariff-proof attributes. \"Despite the runup that we've seen in Alibaba of late, we're still a buyer here, and it's a great way to avoid the tariff tantrum that we're seeing in other sectors,\" Tatro said. \"If you want to avoid the tariffs, you can avoid them very easily by just going abroad. And this is a great example of that. This is a company where 80% to 90% of the revenue comes from within China \u2014 it's estimated that less than 5% comes from the United States. So they'll really be isolated from any tariff talk.\" What's more, Alibaba still looks \"unbelievable\" from a fundamental perspective, the investor added. As proof, Tatro pointed to Alibaba's cash holdings of $67 billion and its plans to invest more than $50 billion in artificial intelligence over the next three years. Exxon Mobil Shares of Exxon Mobil have popped 10% year to date, but Tatro sees more room to rally. \"Even though the administration is going for lower energy prices, we think that deregulation will offset that,\" he said. And like Alibaba, Exxon Mobil is also a \"fundamental champ,\" Tatro added. \"The earnings estimates are for 18% growth next year, very little debt, $20 billion in cash, and you get a 3.4% dividend [yield] while you wait,\" he said. \"The stock hasn't really done anything in the last two years, and it's just starting to get traction. We think it goes higher here.\" Snowflake Finally, Tatro highlighted cloud data storage stock Snowflake as another hedge against tariff headwinds as its business strategy is strong enough to compete in an environment that might squeeze others. \"There's no issues with tariffs here,\" he said. \"They deal with data in the cloud \u2014 maybe some opportunity for tariffs if their customers get hit and see rising prices.\" Shares of Snowflake are down 3% so far this year, but the stock looks pricey, Tatro warned. \"From a fundamental perspective, it does not look cheap. It's trading at a rich valuation, but we feel the estimates are very low,\" he said. \"This stock we believe is a great buying opportunity on this pullback.\" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

In 2025, stocks continue to face a volatile environment, and in mid-March, the S&P 500 index witnessed a correction (a fall of 10% or more). Despite this, the index\u2019s expected P/E ratio remains marginally above the historic 5-year and 10-year average, says the firm. As per Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director, U.S. Bank Asset Management, it\u2019s critical that, in 2025, earnings growth remains on track.\n\nCorporate Earnings Projections in 2025\n\nUS Bank Wealth Management believes that current market projections hint at the 11.5% S&P 500 earnings growth in 2025 versus the prior year. This number is subject to change. However, Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Asset Management, mentioned that when considering the potential impact of tariffs and other issues, it is difficult to expect that 2025 earnings would meet the current projections. Haworth says that the impact of tariffs on company profits is expected to be mixed. Companies that are more dependent on importing goods manufactured overseas can witness more challenges.\n\nIn comparison, the smaller companies, which are not as dependent on foreign trade, are expected to be better placed to mitigate the impact of the trade environment. Because they are not selling in the foreign markets and are not relying on foreign goods, smaller companies can have more pricing power, opines Haworth. This can equate to a healthier earnings picture.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nTechnology Sector Remains Well-Placed\n\nJPMorgan believes that uncertainty related to the trade and other factors of the US administration\u2019s policy agenda continue to lead to a wait and see attitude from businesses and households. Given that household and corporate balance sheets remain relatively healthy, this attitude is expected to be consistent with a slowness in the broader US activity rather than a recession. Coming to the technology sector, in most part, the balance sheets are in healthy shape, with valuations based on forward earnings sitting at a decent place, says JP Morgan. As per the investment firm, these valuations still demonstrate anticipations for very strong 20%+ earnings growth from the US technology sector in 2025.",

Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nCharlie Munger labeled his Alibaba wager one of the worst mistakes of his career shortly before he died. The legendary investor may have been too hasty in writing off his last big bet.\n\nA broader Chinese tech rally has boosted Alibaba stock by 56% this year, and 74% since Munger's death in November 2023. The e-commerce giant's shares have rallied to their highest levels since November 2021, although they still trade at less than half their October 2020 peak.\n\nMunger, Warren Buffett's right-hand man and Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman for more than 40 years, invested both his family's money and some of Daily Journal's spare cash in Alibaba.\n\nDaily Journal is a newspaper publisher and legal software supplier that Munger chaired from 1977 to 2022. Starting in 2009, he grew its stock portfolio from scratch to be worth more than $300 million.\n\nMunger bought 165,000 American depositary shares (ADS) of Alibaba for the company in the first quarter of 2021, marking the first new addition to its US stock portfolio since at least the end of 2013.\n\nEven as Alibaba's stock price nearly halved that year, the billionaire raised the stake to about 602,000 shares worth $72 million at the end of 2021, accounting for 28% of the US stock portfolio's total value.\n\nMunger shifted gears the following quarter, paring Daily Journal's holding to 300,000 shares. That position remained intact until after the investor died, just a few weeks shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Daily Journal cut the stake to 195,000 shares worth $16.5 million at the end of March that year, and it was still that size at the end of December, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.\n\nOwning up to mistakes\n\nIn the same quarter that Munger began buying Alibaba, he scolded cofounder Jack Ma for publicly criticizing the Chinese government, calling him \"very arrogant.\"\n\nFollowing Ma's comments, authorities nixed a planned initial public offering for Alibaba's mobile payments affiliate, Ant Group. They also demanded Ant restructure its business and hit Alibaba with billions of dollars in antitrust penalties. Meanwhile, Jack Ma disappeared from public view.\n\nJack Ma is the cofounder of Alibaba. CFOTO/Future/Getty Images\n\nMunger intentionally rubbed his nose in his missteps to avoid making similar ones in the future. So it's unsurprising that he openly described Alibaba as a terrible error.\n\n\"I regard Alibaba as one of the worst mistakes I ever made,\" Munger said at Daily Journal's annual meeting in February 2023.\n\n\"I got charmed by the idea of their position in the Chinese internet. I didn't stop to realize they're still a goddamn retailer,\" he continued. \"It's going to be a competitive business, the internet \u2014 it's not going to be a cakewalk for everybody.\"\n\nIn his final TV interview in late 2023, Munger said: \"My worst trade was buying a block for the Munger family in Alibaba, which is a pretty good company. But I think it got overhyped, and Jack Ma made mistakes in dealing with the Chinese government. Everybody has some bad ones. The greatest tennis player goes out there some days to the center court and has a bad day. It happens.\"\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nWinners and losers\n\nAlibaba has proven to be less disastrous than Munger feared, and may even turn out to be a winner. Even if it doesn't, he has other stellar bets to hang his hat on.\n\nFor example, he pitched BYD to Buffett, resulting in Berkshire paying $232 million for 225 million shares of the Chinese EV maker in 2008. BYD's stock price has surged from the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of $1 then to record highs of above $50 in recent days.\n\nBerkshire cut its stake from about 20% in 2022 to under 5% by mid-2024, and may have exited the bet completely. If untouched, those 225 million shares would be worth more than $11 billion.\n\nEven though it cashed out, Berkshire likely made well over 20 times its money based on BYD's trading range during its selling timeframe.\n\nMunger may have died believing that investing in Alibaba was a bad decision when it wasn't. Even if he was wrong to buy in, he's knocked it out of the park with bets like BYD.",

The technology can run effectively on mobile devices, making deployment across your organization more feasible than previous-generation virtual human systems.\n\nTh Future of AR in the Workplace\n\nAs AR headsets and glasses become more common in workplace settings, technologies like TaoAvatar will likely shape how we collaborate, train, and communicate. The ability to have realistic virtual humans appear in physical spaces opens possibilities for remote work, distributed teams, and customer engagement that weren\u2019t previously possible.\n\nTaoAvatar represents Alibaba\u2019s latest advancement in creating virtual humans that can communicate and express emotion effectively in AR environments.

This will allow us to build a platform that doesn\u2019t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, OpenAI is reportedly in advanced negotiations to close a record funding round of $40 billion. The round, led by SoftBank, would value OpenAI at $300 billion, which is double compared to its valuation in October 2024. SoftBank is expected to invest $7.5 billion initially and $22.5 billion in the latter half of this year.\n\nThe AI-based humanoid robot industry also made headlines after Realbotix announced that it will showcase an advanced intelligence robot at the DiscoveryX expo in mid-April. The AI-powered humanoid robot, Aria, will demonstrate the company\u2019s efforts to integrate AI, robotics, and human connection through direct interaction with conference attendees.\n\n\u201cDiscoveryX is a great event to showcase how far we\u2019ve come in developing emotionally intelligent, interactive AI,\u201d said Realbotix CEO Andrew Kiguel. \u201cAria isn\u2019t just a robot \u2013 she\u2019s a glimpse into the future of personalized, human-centric technology.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Goldman Sachs report led by research analyst Jacqueline Du, the total addressable market for humanoid robots could reach $38 billion by 2035, which is over six times higher than a previous estimate of $6 billion.

It connects millions of buyers with millions of suppliers from around the world, helping them discover the latest product opportunities and build new supplier partnerships while providing attractive promotional offers. A month-long virtual event, March Expo leverages technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital sourcing to make it easier for US SMEs to access growth opportunities via global trade.\n\nAlibaba.com's US order growth was driven by growth across several key product categories across the country, particularly sports products, which saw an increase of nearly one third (30%) year-on-year. Notably, according to Alibaba.com data, orders for pickleball-related products increased by 197%, as demand for sporting goods in the US continues its growth trajectory and there is rising interest in new and emerging sports.\n\nIn addition, the strong order growth was driven by US SMEs switching to digital sourcing \u2014 buying goods directly from suppliers, rather than intermediaries. New data from Alibaba.com\u2021 revealed that nearly half of SMEs (44%) plan to change suppliers this year \u2014 notably via digital sourcing channels such as online B2B marketplaces. Meanwhile, just under two thirds (59%) of US SMEs surveyed said digital sourcing is more important now compared to this time last year, demonstrating an increased preference for direct sourcing.\n\nKuo Zhang, President, Alibaba.com, said: \"During this year's March Expo, there has been a noticeable shift in favor of digital sourcing, with order volumes amongst US SMEs rising sharply year-on-year. This trend aligns with our recent research, which revealed that US SMEs increasingly recognize the benefits of online sourcing, from affordability to trend responsiveness and supplier reliability. In addition, the rise in sports-related product purchases indicates that SME buyers are increasingly tapping into consumer trends and sourcing ready-made products. As businesses embrace digital sourcing, they gain greater flexibility and access to a wider range of products to support their growth.\"\n\n# # #\n\nNotes to Editors\n\n*The data was collected from March 1 to 7, 2025 and compared with the same period in 2024.\n\n\u2021The research was conducted by Censuswide, among a sample of 1,000 decision makers (aged 18+) in US SMEs who are responsible for sourcing in companies with under 150 employees (excluding sole traders). The data was collected between January 31, 2025 and February 6, 2025. Censuswide abides by and employs members of the Market Research Society and follows the MRS code of conduct which is based on the ESOMAR principles.

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.55% for the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.14%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the online retailer had lost 0.06% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 8.04%, while the S&P 500 lost 6.22%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Alibaba in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.37, down 2.14% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $33.21 billion, indicating an 8.07% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.80 per share and a revenue of $138.29 billion, representing changes of +2.09% and +5.97%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alibaba. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Alibaba is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alibaba has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.05 right now. This denotes a discount relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.05.\n\nInvestors should also note that BABA has a PEG ratio of 0.5 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Commerce was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.33 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, finds itself in the top 26% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow BABA in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

In addition to the dominance of the tech giants, more open-source options have now taken to the spotlight with a new focus in the AI arena.\n\nVarious brands, such as DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Baidu, have demonstrated that AI functions can be developed and executed at a fraction of the cost. They have also navigated securing solid business partnerships and deciding or continuing to provide AI products to consumers as free or low-cost, open source models, while larger companies double down on a proprietary, for-profit trajectory, hiding their best features behind a paywall.\n\nThe latest models, such as DeepSeek\u2019s R1, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2.5-VL, and Baidu\u2019s Ernie 4.5 have been compared to the top models such as OpenAI\u2019s 4o or GPT-4.5 models. Meanwhile, their codes are easily accessible at repositories, such as GitHub or Huggingface for developers to use on unique applications.\n\nLearn more about these open source AI products and consider if you\u2019d be interested in making a switch from a more traditional app.\n\nDeepSeek\n\nDeepSeek, short for Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd., is a Chinese AI startup that gained international attention after its AI models proved to be formidable in quality to those of well-established brands in the industry, including OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others. The company showcased AI models developed in a fraction of the time and operating cost of competitors\u2019 models.\n\nThe young company has been around since April 2023, an offshoot of the parent company High-Flyer, but has developed several AI models. These include the original DeepSeek-LLM, DeepSeek-Math, DeepSeek V2, and DeepSeek V3\u2013 the last of which was announced in November 2024 and was already gaining industry attention. The brand announced its DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero reasoning models in January 2025, which took the AI industry by storm with comparisons to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and o1 models. The infamous introduction affected stock prices, made competitors rethink business strategies, and caused security concerns among government entities.\n\nDeepSeek was released under the MIT License, which indicates it is as open as it can be without being 100% open source. The company calls its AI models \u201copen weight.\u201d Still, they are available on the GitHub repository for users to download and develop.\n\nDeepSeek is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications. Since gaining notoriety, the company has partnered with several companies, including Lenovo, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, among others, to use its AI models.\n\nAlibaba Qwen\n\nAlibaba Qwen, short for Tongyi Qianwen, a large language model family, is among the top 10 open-source models in the world. Alibaba itself is a notable Chinese e-commerce brand. The company announced its first model as a beta in April 2023, which quickly became popular in the AI space as it officially released models as open source throughout the year.\n\nSubsequent models have been released as either partially or fully open source, including Qwen 2, Qwen-VL2, Qwen-vl-max, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Math. The company\u2019s most recent models include Qwen 2.5-Max, which was announced in January 2025, and Qwen2.5-VL, which was announced in March, marketing them as more powerful than rival models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Meta\u2019s Llama-3.1-405 B LLMs.\n\nThe original Qwen model was based on Meta\u2019s Llama LLM\u2013 another open-source model, modified to suit Alibaba\u2019s processes. Future models have been released under the Apache 2.0 License and can be found at the GitHub and Huggingface repositories.\n\nQwen is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications. Since its inception, over 90,000 independent models have been developed based on Qwen\u2019s open-source code.\n\nBaidu Ernie bot\n\nThe Ernie Bot, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, is a chatbot developed by Baidu, a well-known Chinese internet brand. While Baidu has been developing its ERNIE model since 2019, it first released the Ernie 3.0 LLM in March 2023.\n\nSince then, it released Ernie 3.5 in June 2023 and Ernie 4.0 in October 2023. The 4.0 model was reserved for Baidu\u2019s subscription-based products, while the 3.5 model was used for the brand\u2019s free chatbot.\n\nCurrently, the Ernie model is not open source; however, the brand plans to soon make it more available to the public in response to increasing competition in the AI industry, as well as due to rapidly reducing production costs.\n\nBaidu released its Ernie 4.5 LLM, and Ernie X1 reasoning model in mid-March, which has been compared to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek R1, respectively. The brand has plans to make its models open source on June 30. Additionally, the company announced that its chatbot will be free to all users as of April 1. A future model, Ernie 5 is expected to be released during the second half of 2025, similarly being open source and free to use.\n\nErnie is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications.

Our citizens\u2019 information must be protected in the strongest possible ways, which is why we are not only putting a ban on these two Chinese AI companies within our state government but also safeguarding our state\u2019s IT infrastructure from any foreign country of concern,\u201d she said.\n\nBill Gates also recently reiterated concerns about AI replacing most jobs. He believes the rate of advancements in AI could mean that the technology could replace many professions, including doctors and teachers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very profound and even a little bit scary \u2014 because it\u2019s happening very quickly, and there is no upper bound,\u201d Gates said in a recent interview. However, he noted that certain types of jobs will likely never be replaced by AI. He said last year that he remains optimistic about the overall benefits of AI, like \u201cbreakthrough treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions for climate change, and high-quality education for everyone.\u201d\n\nWe selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report posted on March 25, Chinese AI firms have made significant progress in closing the technology gap with the U.S., with some areas now only three months behind, according to 01.AI CEO Lee Kai-fu. He highlighted DeepSeek\u2019s advancements in optimizing chip usage and algorithm efficiency, allowing China to compete more closely in AI development. Despite U.S. semiconductor sanctions, Chinese companies have adapted by improving their algorithms, with DeepSeek even surpassing expectations in certain areas like infrastructure software engineering.\n\nAs per the report, Lee emphasized that investing in proprietary models is becoming more challenging due to competition from major tech firms and open-source alternatives, leading 01.AI to focus on AI applications instead. The company recently launched Wanzhi, a platform for enterprise AI deployment, and expects substantial revenue growth in 2025.\n\nChina Advances AI Despite US Chip Export Controls\n\nSenior foreign officials and major tech companies are urging the Trump administration to ease AI chip export restrictions. In a discussion on March 25, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh explained that initial U.S. controls began in 2022 under the Biden administration, limiting the semiconductor kingpin\u2019s high-end chip shipments to China by restricting interconnect bandwidth. These measures expanded with a 168-page diffusion rule categorizing countries based on access levels. Despite restrictions, Chinese firms like Ant Group continue AI advancements by optimizing available resources, including Huawei and AMD chips, reducing pre-training costs by 20% through heterogeneous computing.\n\nAccording to Singh, the semiconductor kingpin argues that these restrictions are cutting into its revenue, with its China exposure dropping from 20% to below 10%, while AI firms like OpenAI claim the market remains undersupplied, further driving demand for GPUs. Singh noted that U.S. AI models still outperform Chinese counterparts in reasoning and multimodal tasks, giving them a competitive edge. Furthermore, investors remain confident in the Mag 7 stocks, viewing market dips as buying opportunities. However, concerns are rising about data center expansion and energy supply challenges, especially in regions beyond traditional hubs like Virginia.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best ADR Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other best ADR stocks.\n\nAmerican Depositary Receipts (ADR) are US-listed securities that represent shares in foreign companies, allowing American investors to gain exposure to international equities without dealing with foreign exchanges or currencies. Unlike regular shares of domestic companies, ADRs are issued by US banks and trade on American exchanges, typically in US dollars. While they provide easier access to foreign markets, ADRs can carry additional risks such as currency fluctuations, geopolitical factors, and differences in accounting standards or regulatory environments. Investors should also note that ADRs come in two forms: sponsored and unsponsored. Sponsored ADRs are issued in partnership with the foreign company and typically offer more reliable financial reporting and investor communication. Unsponsored ADRs, on the other hand, are created without the company\u2019s direct involvement and may have limited information available, making due diligence more challenging.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Worst ADR Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers\n\nADRs were not particularly popular in the last 15 years, as the US stock market has been the best-performing developed market since the 2008 financial crisis, significantly and consistently outperforming all major European markets as well as the Chinese stock market. The US stock market has massively benefited from the US\u2019s technological leadership and the emergence of tech giants with multi-trillion-dollar capitalizations, a more favorable business environment with lower tax rates, more aggressive financial stimulus, and, more importantly, significantly higher productivity growth vs. other regions. As a result, the US stock markets not only delivered higher earnings growth but also experienced the largest increase in valuations compared to Europe and China. The latter is partially attributed to foreign capital flowing into the US market as investors recognized the superior growth opportunities of US companies.\n\nThe recent political developments initiated by the Trump 2.0 regime have set the stage for a potential reversal of the aforementioned trends, which may drive relative outperformance of foreign markets and make ADRs attractive again. First, the Trump 2.0 tariff turmoil and massive cuts in federal spending are likely to cause an economic slowdown and thus cut the earnings growth potential of domestic companies. Second, the threat of tariffs imposed on the USA\u2019s allies is already causing retaliatory measures, including the potential substitution of American products for European or Canadian alternatives (again, this endangers the earnings growth potential of US domestic companies while boosting the potential of European and Canadian companies). Third, Europe has recognized that the US has become a less reliable partner, as evidenced by the major shift in policies of the new administration, and is already taking steps to ensure its independence and minimize dependence on the US. This is illustrated by the recent decision of Germany to create a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund to boost its defense capabilities (funds which are planned to be spent primarily on European contractors). Last but not least, the increasing tensions between the Western allies could potentially drive a return of European capital to the European continent, which may cause a relative valuation repricing in favor of the European stock market.",

A Wall Street analyst also lifted his price target on the stock on Friday.\n\nAI progress is impressive\n\nStocks across the board were reeling today after the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge for inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, rose 0.4% in February from the prior month and came in 2.8% higher year over year. Both numbers were slightly above estimates, raising concerns about higher inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, Mizuho analyst James Lee maintained an outperform rating on Alibaba and upped his price target from $140 to $170, citing strong progress in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. Lee also believes that the company's AI spending will result in better product recommendations and therefore more products sold.\n\nLee also boosted his revenue outlook for Alibaba's cloud division in the fiscal year 2026 from 13% growth to 17% year over year. He arrives at a $170 price target by applying a 12 multiple on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which he increased from 10 due to better visibility into the company's product road map and better sentiment related to enterprise spending in China.\n\nChinese equities look more appealing\n\nDue to more support from the Chinese government, potential future stimulus, and more belief in AI innovation in the country, Chinese tech stocks certainly look appealing.\n\nTheir valuations are also more attractive, with Alibaba trading at less than 15 times forward earnings. However, if you invest, do so for the long term and prepare for volatility, as sentiment around the regulatory landscape and economy can change quickly and result in volatility.",

Xiaomi is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In 2024, Xiaomi Auto announced plans to expand electric vehicle production, including a battery-powered SU7 passenger car in Beijing, China.\n\nXiaomi reported an annual revenue of $50.6 billion in 2024. As of Mar. 28, 2025, the company has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion.\n\n\n\nHow Does Alibaba Differ From Amazon and eBay? Alibaba hosts a platform for businesses to source products in bulk directly from manufacturers and wholesalers. Amazon focuses on consumers, providing multiple products and fast shipping options. eBay buyers commonly look for collectibles and auction shopping experiences.\n\nHow Does A.I.

            "content": "In this article BABA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIn November 2023, Jack Ma posted an internal memo at Alibaba , urging the e-commerce giant he helped create to \"correct its course.\" The message was as a rallying cry by one of China's most prominent tech leaders to a company going through one of the most tumultuous times in its history. Alibaba's share price was near record lows, growth was stalling amid intensifying competition, management changes were coming thick and fast, and Beijing was still closely scrutinizing the company. Ma himself was barely in the public view. But his message may have instilled some new hope in Alibaba \u2014 the e-commerce giant is now seeing growth in its core business and has become one of the leading artificial intelligence players in China and globally, competing with the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek. And Alibaba is now back in favor with the Chinese government. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares have quietly risen nearly 60% this year, adding more than $100 billion to the company's valuation. \"China tech has awoken being led by Alibaba and investors globally are viewing this as the best way to way China tech ... and we agree. Alibaba is in pole position to benefit from AI and cloud spend,\" Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. CNBC spoke to Alibaba's chairman as well as a former executive and analysts, who painted a picture of the changes at the tech firm that have led to the start of the company's comeback.\n\nAlibaba's fall\n\nAlibaba's downfall was swift. Many have credited its beginning to comments made by Ma in October 2020 where he appeared to criticize China's financial regulator. The comments weren't widely picked up on. Days later, Alibaba's share price hit a record high with its market capitalization exceeding $858 billion. Alibaba was riding wave of successes that had seen it grow into the biggest e-commerce player in China, with international expansion on the agenda and its cloud business growing quickly. To top it all off, Alibaba affiliate Ant Group was gearing up for an initial public offering that would raise north of $34 billion, making it the biggest listing in history. Ant Group, which was also founded by Ma, is a financial technology company that is behind Alipay, one of China's two most prominent mobile payment systems. Just two days before Ant Group was scheduled to list in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the IPO was canceled. At the time, Ant cited changes in China's \"regulatory environment.\"\n\nAnt Group founder Jack Ma. Costfoto | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nWhat followed was several years of intense scrutiny on Ma's empire and China's biggest technology companies. Regulators clamped down on practices from giants that they viewed as anticompetitive, dished out billions of dollars of fines on companies including Alibaba, forced changes to Ant Group's structure and brought in a plethora of rules touching many areas of technology.\n\n'Uncertainty and confusion'\n\nRegulatory scrutiny was one of Alibaba's headaches in 2021. But it was also facing a number of other issues, including uncertainty around the strength of the Chinese economy that was trying to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and rising competition. In particular, newer companies like Pinduoduo and even Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, were capturing attention in China in e-commerce. In March 2023, Alibaba \u2014 a sprawling company that does everything from food delivery to cloud computing and movies \u2014 decided to split into six separate business groups, each with the ability to raise outside funding and go public. Alibaba thought the move would make these units more agile. Then came a leadership reshuffle. Alibaba announced in June 2023 that Daniel Zhang, who had been CEO since 2015 and chairman from 2019, would step down from both roles to focus on the cloud business. But just three months later, Zhang suddenly quit the cloud unit.\n\nEddie Wu, a co-founder of Alibaba, took over as CEO and the head of cloud. Joe Tsai, another co-founder, stepped up to take on the role of chairman. That was one of the most tumultuous times in Alibaba's history. \"During that time period a great sense of uncertainty and confusion hovered over employees. While there was a wait-and-see sort of mentality that set in, the problem was that as time passed, many didn't know just how long that would be,\" Brian Wong, a former Alibaba executive and author of \"The Tao of Alibaba,\" told CNBC. \"While China's economy during the start of Covid initially remained robust, following the lock-downs everything turned and the combination of disrupted supply chains and changes in the economic climate only compounded the concerns of where all of this was headed.\"\n\nJoe and Eddie steady the ship\n\nWu sought to return Alibaba's focus to its core e-commerce and cloud businesses and trim down some of the other initiatives the company had plunged into, moving away from the idea of Alibaba as several separate divisions. Artificial intelligence moved front and center, with Wu and Tsai suggesting the company needed to adopt a startup mentality to keep up with the competition. \"Large companies move very slow and it's because the decision-making structure is too complicated ... So we really needed to get back to nimbleness and act fast,\" Tsai said at the CNBC CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore earlier this month, adding that quick decision-making is key to competing with startup rivals. Tsai said that he and Wu decided the first thing they needed to do was to \"streamline the company.\" \"Instead of talking about Alibaba as six different business units, we talked about ourselves as having two core businesses \u2014 e-commerce and cloud computing,\" Tsai said. \"That simplified everything and our communication. It's very important that we communicate that to our employees. They need to have a simple structure in their minds in order to move faster.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nYounger people in management were also given the power to make decisions, Tsai said. \"It means that actually letting them make some decisions and letting them make mistakes and train them so that they can recover from mistakes,\" Tsai added. Wu and Tsai also scrapped plans to list Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics arm, marking a U-turn on previous commitments. \"Eddie is winning plaudits internally for having trimmed the old and built the new. Jack [Ma] and Joe [Tsai] ultimately made the decision to bet on him and it's paying off,\" Duncan Clark, an early advisor to Alibaba and chairman of BDA, told CNBC by email.\n\nChanging political winds\n\nAfter the Ant Group IPO was scrapped in late 2020, Ma went out of public view. The billionaire was seen as the poster child of Beijing's move to rein in the power of private companies and entrepreneurs. The tightening of regulation and government scrutiny also hit investment. Billions of dollars were wiped off the value of Chinese tech companies while venture capital investment in startups plunged. In a country where government policy and support is key for sectors and companies, Beijing's apparent antagonism toward private business had dampened spirits in the tech sector. But as China continues to face economic headwinds, the role of the technology sector in boosting the economy is back in focus. And in February this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a rare meeting with entrepreneurs urging them to \"show their talents,\" in comments seen as giving support to private businesses.\n\nwatch now\n\nAlibaba's Ma, among other top Chinese CEOs and founders, were present at that gathering. Ma's attendance was particularly interesting, given that his empire was under the microscope over the last few years and he had not been seen with China's political elite for some time. \"Xi's meeting with Jack Ma also sent out a very clear signal on where the Chinese government's priorities are at the moment \u2013 AI development and the growth of private enterprises are clearly important to China's economic growth, and we also believe that Alibaba has the support of the Chinese authorities,\" Chelsey Tam, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC by email. The meeting has helped Alibaba's share price this year. And it appears to have also instilled new confidence in Alibaba to hire and invest. \"It gave us the confidence ... to put our earnings back into capex [capital expenditure] and investments and also hire people,\" Alibaba's Tsai said, referencing a more than $50 billion investment in AI infrastructure over the next three years that the company announced in February.\n\nAI success\n\nA large part of Alibaba's stock rally this year has been driven by the euphoria around DeepSeek and investors looking at tech giants in China to see what they're doing with AI technology. Alibaba is among China's leaders, and in 2023, not long after ChatGPT made a splash, the company launched its first AI model called Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen. The Hangzhou-headquartered company has since aggressively launched numerous models that allow tasks such as video, text and image generation from user prompts. Alibaba has made its models open source, meaning anyone can download them and build upon them. This has been key to its success. Some of the most popular models on Hugging Face, a global repository of AI models, are built on Qwen. \"Alibaba has been consistently releasing high-impact open source models on Hugging Face since early 2023,\" Tiezhen Wang, a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, told CNBC. Wang said Alibaba's models, which cover features like video, image and text generation, \"deliver strong performance across tasks.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nWhile Alibaba was early in the AI model game, it was the release of a research paper from Chinese firm DeepSeek this year that forced all eyes to focus on what was going on in China. DeepSeek claimed its AI model was trained at a fraction of the cost of leading AI players and on less-advanced Nvidia chips, leading to a global stock sell-off. \"DeepSeek was a wake up call that China tech is not just sitting idle on AI and this indirectly benefits Alibaba as the appetite for AI is clear in China,\" Wedbush Securities' Ives said.\n\nAI competition ramps up\n\nAlibaba's first models actually predate DeepSeek. But competition in China is ramping up. Some of the country's biggest tech firms from Baidu to Tencent continue to release models. But there are questions about how Alibaba will make money off open-source AI models that are free. The answer, according to investors, AI experts and the company executives, is Alibaba's cloud computing business. Open source allows a company to build a community of developers around a particular model, strengthening its capabilities and also its reach globally. More availability of AI and growing demand also means Alibaba could ultimately drive growth in its cloud computing business. Alibaba effectively charges companies to use its servers and computing power which is required to run AI applications, even if it's not Alibaba's models.\n\nwatch now",

The somewhat awkwardly named Qwen2.5-Omni-7B is multimodal, meaning it can digest various types of inputs comprising text, video, images, audio, and others.\n\nAlibaba has made Qwen2.5 open-source.

The company didn't hesitate to point out that this is habitual, as it has released more than 200 AI models as open-source offerings.\n\nQwen2.5's maker lavished praise on the new model. In Alibaba Cloud's announcement, the company wrote that it \"delivers uncompromised performance and powerful multimodal capabilities.\"\n\n\"This unique combination makes it the perfect foundation for developing agile, cost-effective AI agents that deliver tangible value, especially intelligent voice applications,\" Alibaba added.\n\nFever pitch\n\nAI development in China has been especially feverish since the January release of domestic start-up company DeepSeek's R1 model. According to many users, the output produced by R1 is comparable to those from some of the top AI developers around the world, leading to something of a scramble to build a better (and, crucially, more cost-effective) mousetrap.\n\nGiven that, investors should monitor the reaction from AI professionals about Qwen2.5's capabilities. If it works as hyped, it should keep Alibaba competitive in the Great AI Race.",

            "content": "BMW is making some important moves in the AI space in China, and nowhere is that more evident than in its latest partnership with Alibaba Group. Announced today, this strategic collaboration aims to develop a next-generation AI engine tailored specifically for Chinese consumers. At the heart of the project is the integration of Alibaba\u2019s Tongyi Qianwen large language model (LLM) and Banma\u2019s in-car smart cockpit platform\u2014technology that will debut in BMW\u2019s Neue Klasse models produced in China from 2026. The first model to roll out? The long wheelbase BMW iX3.\n\nThe AI engine, co-developed by BMW and Alibaba, is built on Yan AI, a Qwen-powered solution from Banma. BMW then stacks its own proprietary adaptation layer on top of this base model\u2014training the system to understand BMW-specific language, behaviors, and tone of voice. This system will supercharge the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) with human-like conversation skills, multi-agent support, and seamless access to digital services\u2014delivering what BMW calls a more \u201cempathetic\u201d in-car experience.\n\nBMW says it achieved an impressive 99% recognition and wake-up rate in lab testing\u2014setting a new standard for speed, accuracy, and natural dialogue in the car.\n\nThe partnership is part of BMW Group\u2019s broader 360-degree full-chain AI strategy for China, which includes digitalized production, AI-enhanced R&D, predictive battery monitoring, and cloud-based over-the-air (OTA) capabilities. Dr. Franz Decker, CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, described the project as a co-creation model that reflects BMW\u2019s commitment to long-term innovation in China\u2019s competitive automotive landscape.\n\nBMW also introduced two new AI agents that will roll out with Neue Klasse models in China:\n\nCar Genius: A technical expert embedded into the vehicle, helping drivers with diagnostics, configuration, and maintenance\u2014even connecting with customer care when needed.\n\nA technical expert embedded into the vehicle, helping drivers with diagnostics, configuration, and maintenance\u2014even connecting with customer care when needed. Travel Companion: A personal concierge that suggests, among many others, hotels, restaurants, points of interest, and entertainment\u2014all filtered through your preferences and context.\n\nBut the real story? We got to see it in action.\n\nInside the Skylab: A Live Demo of iDrive X with Alibaba\u2019s AI\n\nBMWBLOG was invited to the BMW R&D Center in Beijing, where we stepped into the brand\u2019s \u201cSkylab\u201d innovation hub to experience the AI-powered iDrive X system for ourselves. The demonstration was part workshop, part preview of what the future of human-vehicle interaction looks like.\n\nThe system\u2019s natural language understanding was immediately impressive. A BMW engineer asked the IPA to \u201cFind a restaurant near the location with parking, light food, a 300 CNY per person budget, and 5 star reviews.\u201d Within seconds, it parsed real-time traffic data, user preferences, and public reviews to generate a perfectly tailored recommendation\u2014no tapping, no menus, just conversation.\n\nAnd it gets smarter from there.\n\nFor example, we asked: \u201cCan you find me a hotel with rich cultural content?\u201d The assistant recommended The Peninsula, a top-tier choice with cultural cachet.\n\nWhen we followed up with: \u201cWhat about a highly rated hotel with mountain and lake views?\u201d The system immediately located options matching those parameters\u2014cross-referencing 18 million pieces of real-time and contextual data including geography, user preferences, traffic, and reviews.\n\nThe IPA also recognized and responded to more personal or playful prompts. When one tester said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling nervous.\u201d The system proactively adjusted the cabin temperature to a warmer setting, offering comfort.\n\nThe AI can also explain dashboard alerts\u2014like telling what the seat belt warning sign means, \u2014and even read your horoscope, just for fun.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just useful\u2014it\u2019s got personality. When a user asked the assistant, \u201cCan you be my girlfriend?\u201d the system playfully replied, \u201cI can be your travel companion since you\u2019re looking for one.\u201d\n\nWhat makes BMW\u2019s system unique is how it\u2019s built. While Alibaba\u2019s Qwen forms the foundation, BMW\u2019s adaptation layer tailors everything\u2014from voice tone to UX design\u2014to match the brand\u2019s philosophy. That layered approach gives BMW full control over how the AI looks, feels, and responds in the cabin.\n\nPowered by Alibaba\u2019s Qwen\u2014and Built to Adapt\n\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s Banma LLM (based on Qwen) is the current foundation, BMW made it clear the platform is modular. The system could one day integrate with Baidu\u2019s ERNIE or DeepSeek, depending on the evolution of LLMs in China.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW engineers are already leveraging AI for joint coding, defect detection, voice-based testing, and contextual control development. The AI system is also deeply integrated with gesture recognition, voice tone analysis, and body position tracking, creating a dynamic cabin that responds to how you feel, not just what you say.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. The LLM-based assistant includes multi-agent support, meaning it knows when to reach out to third-party AI agents for information or task execution. Whether it\u2019s pulling from restaurant databases, trip planning services, or maintenance logs, the AI is smart enough to collaborate\u2014and even incorporate what it learns back into its own model for future refinement.\n\nAdditionally, the system leverages multi-modal input:\n\nVoice commands\n\nEye movement tracking\n\nHand gestures\n\nBody posture awareness\n\nTogether, these enable seamless, intuitive interactions where the car anticipates needs instead of just reacting to requests. In short, your BMW could soon function as an intuitive co-pilot that adapts to your driving, habits, and lifestyle. For example, if it senses you\u2019re in a hurry to the airport, it might suggest a relaxing playlist with a prompt like: \u201cBusy as you are, you deserve a song to make the journey a little easier.\u201d\n\nThis emotional intelligence is part of what BMW calls \u201chuman-centered intelligence.\u201d The IPA comes with an expressive avatar, emotional voice modulation, and empathetic persona, making every interaction feel personal, not robotic.\n\nThe Neue Klasse: Built for a New Generation of Drivers\n\nBMW\u2019s investment in AI in China isn\u2019t just a technological leap\u2014it\u2019s a cultural one. In China, the average BMW customer is 36.1 years old, significantly younger than the 56.8 average in Europe. This younger demographic expects their vehicles to be smart, connected, and fun\u2014an extension of their digital lifestyle.\n\nFor these drivers, the car is no longer just a machine for getting from point A to B\u2014it\u2019s part entertainment hub, part digital assistant, and part social space. As BMW executives explained during our visit, Chinese customers place a much higher priority on in-car entertainment and smartphone integration. Bringing the \u201csmartphone life\u201d into the vehicle is not just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s essential.\n\nAdding to this, lower average driving speeds in China due to dense urban traffic have opened up new use cases for AI-powered infotainment. BMW is actively working to unlock more in-car entertainment options to keep drivers and passengers engaged during slower commutes and daily travel.\n\nBut bringing AI into the car isn\u2019t as simple as dropping in a chatbot. As BMW engineers explained, it requires deep integration with vehicle systems, user experience layers, and safety-critical architecture. Voice recognition, emotional understanding, intent prediction, and third-party agent coordination all have to work together\u2014seamlessly and securely\u2014in real time.\n\nThis is why BMW\u2019s AI strategy for China is so comprehensive. From local development hubs to a fully modular LLM stack, the company is building something that doesn\u2019t just work in China\u2014it was designed for China from the ground up.",

Tsai reportedly called the meeting a \"very clear signal\" that Beijing was pushing companies to grow their personnel and investment. Contending with rising young unemployment and declining consumption, the government has been trying to restore economic development.The Hangzhou-based e-commerce and cloud services company also revealed intentions to improve its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure by 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) over the next three years. Tsai said Alibaba is more concerned with matching investment with real demand than with speculative hopes.Citing over $500 billion in total expenditure on data centers and associated infrastructure, Tsai expressed worry about what he called a possible artificial intelligence investment bubble in the United States. He said that part of this expenditure seemed speculative given the speed of rollout surpassing present need.The chairman's comments come against a backdrop of indications of stability in China's technology industry. The success of local AI firm DeepSeek, which has stressed open-source technologies, has raised the industry mood and is likely to encourage additional employment, especially among fresh graduates looking for positions in information technology.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

This decision comes as Alibaba Group attempts to focus more on monetising its products and growing its customer base.\n\nAlizila, Alibaba Group\u2019s digital newsroom, said on its website: \u201cUnder the partnership, the new BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) will integrate a bespoke AI engine co-developed by BMW and Alibaba.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe AI engine will be based on the Yan AI, a Qwen-empowered smart cockpit AI solution developed by Banma, Alibaba\u2019s intelligent cockpit solution provider. The AI-enhanced IPA will debut in BMW Neue Klasse models produced in China starting from 2026, setting a new benchmark for intelligent, intuitive and engaging human-vehicle interaction.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration is expected to be a significant milestone in advancing AI-driven mobility in China. These AI features will focus on improving in-car mobility services, such as their navigation and assistance features, as well as more natural voice interactions.\n\nIt will also support Alibaba\u2019s ambitions to spark change through AI technology, along with BMW\u2019s goal of integrating AI across its product range.\n\nBMW\u2019s Neue Klasse models will initially have two AI agents, dubbed Travel Companion and Car Genius. These can be used for customised lifestyle services and real-time help. This includes things like planning dinner outings, which the AI system offers by combining restaurant ratings, real-time traffic data and personal preferences.\n\nRelated Tesla and BMW sue EU as discontent over Chinese EV tariffs mounts\n\n\u201cOur long-term partnership with Alibaba Group is exemplary of common growth achieved with co-creation. BMW will work closer with Chinese tech partners on electric mobility and intelligent technologies to write our renewed win-win story,\u201d Sean Green, President and CEO of BMW Group Region China, said.\n\nEddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba Group, added: \u201cOur partnership with BMW Group marks a pivotal leap in deploying AI-powered large language models at the forefront of advanced manufacturing, and Qwen\u2019s integration into BMW\u2019s in-car systems showcases how AI can revolutionize mobility,\u201d \u201cAI is a driving force to advance productivity across industries. We look forward to working closely with BMW to pioneer AI applications in the mobility sector that drive innovation and truly elevate user experience,\u201d he continued.\n\nBMW continues to focus on electric vehicles\n\nBMW Group has focused heavily on electric vehicles in the last few years, seeking to establish a significant share of all-electric vehicle sales by this year. It also aims to produce fully-electric versions of key models, planning to make subsidiary products from Rolls-Royce and MINI Cooper completely electric by the early 2030s.\n\nThe launch of the Neue Klasse is expected to considerably help the group meet its goal of hiking its all-electric delivery share to 50% from this year onwards.\n\n\u201cFully-electric vehicles accounted for over 17% of total sales last year. Including plug-in hybrids, nearly one in four vehicles sold was electrified,\u201d Oliver Zipse, the chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, said at the Annual Conference 2025 in Munich.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting further growth in e-mobility in 2025. We will hit two major milestones this year: We will reach the total of more than three million electrified vehicles and over 1.5 million BEVs sold since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Our customers can choose between over 15 BEVs across all our brands,\u201d he continued.\n\nHowever, European electric vehicle makers as a whole are still struggling, with several car companies such as Volkswagen and Volvo adjusting EV targets. This is mainly because of weaker-than-expected EV demand, as well as an increased focus on hybrid technology.\n\nRising competition from Chinese rivals such as BYD, SAIC and Geely as well as decreased government subsidies for both electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles from Germany, the UK, France and more European countries have contributed to the uncertain outlook for the EV sector too.",

Some of the envisioned projects commenced raising funds without having secured \u201cuptake\u201d agreements, he added. \u201cI start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec. There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.\u201d\n\nTsai singled out US spending in particular. Just this year, Amazon.com Inc pledged to spend $100 billion on AI infrastructure, while Alphabet Inc pledged $75 billion and Meta Platforms Inc up to $65 billion.\n\nTech firms on both sides of the Pacific such as Microsoft Corp, SoftBank Group Corp, are spending billions of dollars buying the Nvidia Corp and SK Hynix Inc chips crucial to AI development. Alibaba itself \u2014 which in February declared it was going all-in on AI \u2014 plans to invest more than 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) over the next three years.\n\nServer farms are springing up from India to Malaysia, while in the US, Trump is touting a Stargate project that envisions an outlay of half a trillion dollars, the report added.\n\nMany on Wall Street have begun to question that spending, especially after Chinese upstart DeepSeek released an open-source AI model that it claims rivals US technology but was built at a fraction of the cost. Critics also pointed out the persistent dearth of practical, real-world applications for AI. The Chinese start-up released an update to its V3 model on Tuesday that claims to enhance programming capabilities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still astounded by the type of numbers that\u2019s being thrown around in the US about investing into AI,\u201d Tsai told the audience.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking, literally talking about $500 billion, several 100 billion US dollars. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely necessary. I think in a way, people are investing ahead of the demand that they are seeing today, but they are projecting much bigger demand.\u201d",

He pointed out the reckless rush by tech firms, investment funds, and other entities to set up server bases from the U.S. to Asia, potentially leading to numerous projects being developed without a well-defined customer base, reported the South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking literally about $500 billion, several $100 billion [projects]. I don't think that is entirely necessary,\u201d Tsai stated. The Alibaba Chair spoke specifically about the AI investments in the U.S.\n\n\"I start to get worried when people are building data centers on speculation,\u201d Tsai added.\n\nMajor tech companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and SoftBank Group Corp. SFTBY are investing billions in AI development.

The analysts also noted that while tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure, leading to a significant semiconductor revenue boom, most companies are still in the early stages of adoption.\n\nGiven these factors, Tsai\u2019s warning about a potential bubble in data center construction is significant and warrants attention from investors and tech companies alike.\n\nAlibaba holds a momentum rating of 96.04% and a growth rating of 73.41%, according to Benzinga\u2019s Proprietary Edge Rankings.

Jack Ma of Alibaba, owner of the Taobao and Tmall Group, has been spotted at the group\u2019s Hangzhou HQ since late last year, and his appearances are becoming more frequent, including at Freshippo and sometimes at Quark AI. Meanwhile, Richard Liu of JD.com, the e-commerce arch-rival of Taobao and Tmall Group, has also reportedly \u201creturned to the frontline\u201d. Are we seeing e-commerce competition heating up again in China?\n\nSince speaking at the 20th-anniversary event at Ant Group in early December and attending President Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with business leaders in February, Ma is now a regular at Alibaba\u2019s HQ in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. His speech at the event and visits to the Quark AI office were seen as the driver behind Alibaba\u2019s reported \u201call in\u201d in AI. Pundits call Alibaba\u2019s recent moves of divesting \u201cnon-core\u201d businesses and focusing on e-commerce and \u201clocal life\u201d services a \u201creturn to form\u201d of \u201cclassic Alibaba\u201d.\n\nImage: JD.com/Weibo Image: Taobao/Weibo\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Liu was reported earlier this month to have been behind the wheel at JD.com in the past year, achieving one of the best recent results with the full-year report of 2024. On 17 March, Liu visited the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and reviewed several AI projects at the campus. On 21 March, he posted a WeChat Moment celebrating the results of the social security JD.com provides to delivery drivers.\n\nMeanwhile, Wang Xing of Meituan and Zhang Yiming both remain active in 2025, and both are working on AI. With the e-commerce market reaching saturation, the competition between platforms is visibly heating up. JD Takeaway recently announced that it has already completed over 1 million orders in just 40 days since launch, taking on Meituan and Alibaba\u2019s Ele.me. Meanwhile, JD Service+ repair services recently launched on Taobao and Tmall in early March, showing that sometimes working together can be equally as important as competing.\n\nNeed to boost your China strategy?

A regulatory clampdown on the industry four years ago sapped corporate appetite for investment and led to widespread layoffs.The meeting was also seen as reflecting policymakers' concerns about slow growth and U.S. efforts to limit technological development in the world's second-largest economy.It \"was a very, very clear signal to the business community that, go ahead, reinvest in your business and also go out and hire people,\" Tsai told HSBC's Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong.He noted Alibaba's headcount had declined for the past 12 quarters.\"So I think we've reached the bottom, and we're going to start to reboot and rehire.\"China's economy has been beset by sputtering growth over the past few years, also hobbled by a debt crisis in the real estate sector, leading to job insecurity, high unemployment for the country's youth and weak consumer sentiment.Hiring, however, would lead to good things, Tsai said.\"Once you hire people, that gives people job security, right, job security and income growth that will translate from business confidence into consumer confidence,\" he said.Guo Shan, a partner at Hutong Research, said private firms like Alibaba were key to creating jobs for China's 13 million college students graduating every year, given that roughly a quarter of those graduates usually wanted jobs in IT and internet-related sectors.She noted that the success of DeepSeek, the Chinese startup which has shaken up the AI sector with its low-cost models, has also been a boon.\"DeepSeek and particularly its open-source nature has boosted confidence in China's tech sector and widened the application scenarios - so tech firms will need to hire more for businesses anyway,\" she said.While Alibaba has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence, Tsai said he was \"astounded by the type of numbers that's being thrown around\" in the United States.\"People are talking about $500 billion, several hundred billion dollars. I don't think that's entirely necessary. I think in a way, people are investing ahead of the demand that they're seeing today.\"He said he thought it was worrying when people began to talk about building data centers on spec, adding that he was seeing \"the beginning of some kind of bubble.\"By comparison, Alibaba plans to invest at least 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure over the next three years.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index, comprising leading tech companies including Alibaba, has risen 24% this year, fuelled by Xi's meeting with tech sector leaders and excitement over DeepSeek's AI models.

            "content": "Alibaba (BABA) Chairman Joe Tsai is raising concerns about the rapid expansion of AI data centers, warning that the boom could turn into a bubble. Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong, Tsai said companies are racing to build server farms, often without confirmed customers. \u201cI start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,\u201d he told delegates at the summit, questioning whether these soaring investments truly reflect real AI demand.\n\nAt the same event, Tsai struck a more optimistic tone on China\u2019s business environment, saying there are clear signs of growing confidence among entrepreneurs following a meeting between President Xi and Chinese tech leaders in Beijing. He noted that the Chinese government has sent a strong signal for businesses to reinvest and expand, leading Alibaba to resume hiring.\n\nBig Tech Firms Pour Billions into AI Infrastructure\n\nMajor tech firms are investing heavily in AI, but Tsai fears they may be going too far. He noted that Microsoft (MSFT), SoftBank, and Alibaba are spending billions on AI infrastructure, raising concerns about overspending. In the U.S., companies like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) have committed more than $200 billion this year alone.\n\nFor instance, Amazon plans to invest $100 billion, while Alphabet has allocated $75 billion for AI projects. Meanwhile, Meta is set to spend up to $65 billion to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nThough AI is thriving, unchecked spending without securing real AI demand could turn the gold rush into an expensive bubble, Tsai warned. He said, \u201cPeople are talking about $500 billion, several hundred billion dollars. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely necessary.\u201d\n\nRising Doubts on AI Spending\n\nWall Street analysts are also beginning to question AI spending, pointing to signs of overcapacity. In February, TD Cowen reported that Microsoft had canceled some U.S. data center leases, raising doubts about long-term demand. However, Microsoft dismissed concerns, saying its capital spending plans remain flexible.\n\nAdding to the debate, Chinese startup DeepSeek recently built a competitive AI model at a fraction of the cost, showing that massive spending may not be essential for AI breakthroughs. Its open-source model claims to rival U.S. technology, suggesting that some companies may be overspending on AI infrastructure. On Tuesday, DeepSeek advanced its technology further with an upgrade to its V3 model, which improves programming capabilities, highlighting that AI progress isn\u2019t solely dependent on billion-dollar data centers.\n\nIs BABA a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on BABA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on a unanimous 16 Buy recommendations. Over the past year, BABA has increased by more than 92%, and the average BABA price target of $165.61 implies an upside potential of 23.15% from current levels.\n\nSee more BABA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

BABA BABAF Chairman Joe Tsai announced Tuesday the company will resume hiring, signaling growing confidence in China\u2019s business landscape following recent economic policy shifts.\n\nWhat Happened: Speaking at HSBC\u2019s Global Investment Summit, Reuters reported that Tsai highlighted a pivotal meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and private business leaders as a turning point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very clear sign of business entrepreneurs becoming more confident since January,\u201d Tsai told attendees, emphasizing the government\u2019s encouraging message to reinvest and expand the workforce.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s hiring plans come amid a remarkable resurgence in Chinese equities.

The company is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, committing $52 billion to cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.\n\nThe tech sector\u2019s momentum is further bolstered by innovations from companies like Baidu Inc. BIDU, which recently unveiled its Ernie X1 AI model, claiming performance comparable to competitors at half the cost.\n\nAnalysts remain cautiously optimistic. With Alibaba\u2019s current consensus price target of $138.26 and some analysts projecting up to $190, the company appears poised for significant growth in the rapidly evolving Chinese tech market.\n\nPrice Action: Alibaba\u2019s ADR closed at $134.48 on Monday, down 0.49%. After hours, it dipped to $134.45.

Jack Ma founded the company and its affiliate, Alibaba.\n\nBloomberg reported Monday, citing sources, that Ant has used chips from Alibaba and Huawei for training AI models. Ant also used Nvidia chips but now relies more on alternatives from Advanced Micro Devices and Chinese chips, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nAnt did declined CNBC's request for comment.\n\nThe company on Monday announced \"major upgrades\" to its AI solutions for healthcare, which it said were being used by seven major hospitals and healthcare institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Ningbo.\n\nThe healthcare AI model is built on DeepSeek's R1 and V3 models, Alibaba's Qwen and Ant's own BaiLing. Ant's healthcare-specific model is able to answer questions about medical topics, and can also help improve patient services, according to the company statement.\n\nThe U.S. has sought to restrict China's AI development by limiting Chinese businesses' access to the most advanced semiconductors used for training models. Nvidia can still sell its lower-end chips to China.",

            "content": "While the U.S. stock market has been under pressure, the ADRs (American depositary receipts) of Chinese stocks have suddenly become red hot. And there could be a lot more upside ahead.\n\nOne of the most intriguing Chinese stocks right now is Alibaba (BABA -0.41%). Let's look at four reasons to buy the stock like there is no tomorrow.\n\n1. Alibaba is leading the way with AI\n\nDespite export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, Chinese companies have been making great strides in artificial intelligence (AI), and Alibaba is one of the leaders in the space. The company has said that its newest Qwen 2.5 model outperforms the competition, including models from Chinese rival DeepSeek and U.S. companies such as Meta Platforms and OpenAI.\n\nIn addition to its foundation model, Alibaba also offers several task-specific open-source models as well. In the fall, it launched over 100 of these models, including ones designed specifically for things like mathematics and coding. Earlier this month, meanwhile, it introduced a new AI assistant powered by its new QwQ-32B AI reasoning model.\n\nAlibaba's AI prowess is starting to show up in its Cloud Intelligence results, which is its cloud computing segment. Last quarter, segment revenue grew 13% despite the company continuing to let lower margin contract revenue roll off, as AI-related revenue once again more than doubled. Profitability, meanwhile, soared with segment-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumping 33%.\n\nIn addition, the company is beginning to partner with other leading tech companies. Apple will use Alibaba's AI model to power its Apple Intelligence solution in China, which is a big win. Meanwhile, it recently teamed up with Chinese AI start-up Manus AI to collaborate on agentic AI, with which AI agents can go out and perform tasks for you.\n\n2. Alibaba is turning around its core e-commerce businesses\n\nIn addition to its AI opportunities, Alibaba is seeing signs that it is turning around its e-commerce business, which consists of leading platforms Tmall and Taobao. The former is an e-commerce marketplace where established brands sell their merchandise, while on the latter, both individuals and businesses can sell their goods.\n\nThese businesses had been under pressure due to a lagging Chinese economy and competitive pressures. However, the company invested heavily in its e-commerce segment to first help boost its gross merchandise value (GMV), which is the total value of goods sold through its platforms, and then better monetize its platform. This came in the form of adding a small software service fee, promoting its 88VIP premium memberships, and developing a new AI marketing tool called Quanzhantui.\n\nLast quarter, these efforts started to bear fruit, with third-party revenue climbing 9% and overall segment revenue up 5%. Segment EBITDA, meanwhile, edged up 2%.\n\nThis turnaround is still in its early days, but clear progress has been made.\n\n3. Emerging businesses offer Alibaba some good upside\n\nAlibaba also operates a number of emerging businesses, of which its International commerce segment (AIDC) is the farthest along. This consists of its AliExpress cross-border business, which connects Chinese sellers to overseas buyers, as well as Trendyol, which is focused on local merchants in Turkey and the Middle East. It has also been building out its Cainiao logistics business to better serve AliExpress and shorten delivery times to make the platform more competitive.\n\nIts AIDC segment has been growing quickly, with revenue jumping 32% last quarter. However, the segment remains a drag on profitability, with negative EBITDA of $678 million last quarter, as the business has still not reached scale.\n\nHowever, management has said it expects the segment to turn its first profit within the next fiscal year. Flipping this business to profitability would be a very nice boost to the company's earnings growth moving forward.\n\n4. Alibaba's stock is attractively valued\n\nIn addition to the opportunities in front of it, Alibaba's stock remains attractively valued despite the big jump in its share price this year. The stock is up more than 60% year to date as of this writing.\n\nIt trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 15 for fiscal 2026 analyst estimates. That's about half the valuation of its closest U.S. counterpart, Amazon. Alibaba also has $23.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, as well as $47.4 billion in equity and other investments on its balance sheet, which accounts for over 20% of its market cap.\n\nWhile I don't think Alibaba should have the same valuation as Amazon, I think there is room to close the gap a bit. Meanwhile, the company has a lot of potential to begin accelerating both revenue and earnings growth in the near future, making it a solid option to buy.",

            "content": "At first sight China seems an unappealing investment proposition.\n\nA host of problems besets the world's second-largest economy, including US President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs, a disinclination to spend among its 1.4billion population and a sharply declining birth rate.\n\nBy 2030, there are predicted to be more pets in China than toddlers. But investors keen to diversify may still be interested in a nation that gave the world TikTok \u2013 and is now responsible for the most talked-about technological innovation of recent months.\n\nThis is DeepSeek, the bargain-priced artificial intelligence (AI) model, created in Hangzhou in the province of Zhejiang. The system is a rival for the much more costly American ChatGPT.\n\nDeepSeek's arrival rocked Wall Street last year, since it called into question America's lead in the AI revolution. US broker JP Morgan argues DeepSeek's low cost should enable Chinese companies to experiment with AI to improve customer engagement and sales.\n\nThe DeepSeek factor was one reason for the 22 per cent rise in the MSCI China index last year. Since January, it has advanced by a further 12 per cent.\n\nOn the rise: The MSCI China index rose 22 per cent last year, and since January it has advanced by a further 12 per cent\n\nThis suggests that, while attention was focused on US tech stocks, some investors were seeking to make the most of China's lead in fields such as battery tech, drones, robotics \u2013 and electric vehicles (EV).\n\nShenzen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world's number one EV maker. The shares have leapt by 32 per cent this year, driven by claims it can fully charge a car in five minutes.\n\nThe jump in the MSCI index also reflects the double-digit rises of its three largest constituents: Tencent, which operates the We Chat app but also develops video games such as League of Legends; tech titan Alibaba; and food delivery platform Meituan, which serves 60million orders a day.\n\nThe share price rises suggest a level of optimism, despite a debt-laden property market, which has dented the nation's low consumer confidence.\n\nSince the end of the pandemic, the Chinese have been reluctant to splash out \u2013 a blow for European luxury goods groups such as LVMH, and which could also mean deflation in China, aggravating property sector woes after the high-profile failures of construction companies.\n\nGeopolitical tensions are also a threat, as Premier Li Qiang, the third most powerful official in the government, warned this month: 'Changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace.'\n\nHe promised more stimulus to shield manufacturers from tariffs, plus solutions to the housing slump but made it clear that boosting consumption, through such steps as creating more jobs, was the top priority.\n\nThe budget for the consumer goods trade-in programme, where households are subsidised for trading in household goods and second-hand cars for new ones, is to be raised.\n\nGood news for BYD and other EV players including Nio and Xpeng.\n\nPeiqian Liu, Asia economist at Fidelity International, says Qiang implied more would be done to counteract Trump's policies, saying: 'Almost five decades ago, China's former leader Deng Xiaoping would often say that the country was 'crossing the river by feeling for the stones'.\n\n'That cautious approach helped turn China into an economic powerhouse. This time, arguably, the water is deeper and more turbulent. Policy-makers are treading more carefully.'\n\nInvestors should also be treading carefully. But if you want to explore, here are the options.\n\nWarning: Premier Li Qiang\n\nHow to invest\n\nVenturing into China will be hazardous since history is not necessarily a guide to how China will fare in this trade war.\n\nIt may have weathered the tariffs imposed under the first Trump presidency, and exports to the US may be just 13 per cent of total overseas trade, but this may still not necessarily minimise volatility.\n\nIt is possible to buy shares in US and Hong Kong-quoted Chinese companies through investor platforms including Interactive Investor.\n\nAlibaba, BYD and Tencent are among the groups quoted in Hong Kong.\n\nThere are ways to invest in Shenzhen or Shanghai-quoted companies, but the most practical route is through a fund or trust.\n\nYou can choose an index tracker like the HSBC China exchange traded fund (ETF) which tracks the MSCI China index.\n\nBut if you want something more adventurous, Darius McDermott, managing director of Fund Calibre, says it is essential to find a fund manager who is a skilled stockpicker.\n\nHe cites the FSSA All China fund, which has stakes in Tencent, Meituan and China Mengniu, a dairy products group.\n\nFidelity China Special Situations is another possibility. This trust's holdings include Tencent and Pony.ai, a leader in autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe company, which runs driverless taxis in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, floated on the US Nasdaq exchange last November to gain global recognition.\n\nByte Dance, the unquoted group that owns TikTok, is another trust investment.\n\nInvestors worldwide would like to get a slice of the DeepSeek action. Within weeks of its launch, the app was the most downloaded on the Apple Store.\n\nBut founder Liang Wenfeng does not want outside investment. The hedge fund entrepreneur may be finding his national hero status enough to cope with.\n\nHow to spread your risk\n\nIf you want to lessen the gamble, but are keen on wider exposure to Asia, you could consider Temit \u2013 the Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust. It holds Alibaba and Tencent, but also the South Korean firm Samsung Electronics.\n\nIts largest stake is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which makes the microchips powering ChatGPT.\n\nNote, however, that it is also in the crosshairs of the tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\nThe JP Morgan Emerging Markets trust also holds TSMC and Tencent but, by way of counterbalance, it also own Mercado Libre \u2013 which is Argentina's answer to Amazon.\n\nMcDermott suggests Baillie Gifford Pacific, where China is about a third of the portfolio. Other holdings include Mediatek, a less famous Taiwan microchip firm.\n\nIf you are concerned about China's form of government and reports about the oppression of the Uyghurs \u2013 the country's Muslim minority \u2013 you should probably look for other ways to diversify your portfolio.\n\nThere is no way to establish that a Chinese company takes a principled stand on these issues.\n\nSustainability is rising up the corporate agenda, but critics argue that this drive is more about achieving world dominance in battery technology, electric cars and solar panels rather than saving the planet.\n\nThese issues will come to the fore when Chinese fast fashion giant Shein aims to make its stock market debut in London this year.",

            "content": "StockX is an online marketplace and resale platform founded in 2015 as an e-commerce site for die-hard sneaker collectors (\u201csneakerheads\u201d) to sell their shoes on a secondary market . Since its public launch in 2016, it has expanded to sell luxury apparel, electronics, and other collectibles.\n\nThe founders of StockX\u2014Josh Luber, Chris Kaufman, and two Quicken Loan executives, Dan Gilbert and Greg Schwartz\u2014created the platform to make buying and selling of high-end sneakers and other luxury goods easier and more transparent by mimicking a stock market. A data-driven, real-time approach, plus verification of all goods sold on the site, helps to set StockX apart from other online resellers that also have an auction approach, such as eBay.\n\nStrategic and competitive advantages\n\nModern financial markets rely on robust systems of transparency, standardization, and execution efficiency. StockX has essentially set up a system that mirrors the roles of the exchange, broker, and clearinghouse.\n\nStandardized approach. Products sold on StockX are assigned a ticker symbol, which makes the value of an item transparent. Current bid and last sale prices are listed prominently. Each page has a product photo and details such as style, color, retail price, and release date, plus descriptions of the product. Like a brokerage\u2019s price page for a security, StockX includes data showing real-time price fluctuations based on demand, sales history, and trading volume.\n\nVerified authenticity. StockX reviews 100% of items that come to its platform to weed out counterfeits. It uses a multistep verification process, including machine learning and other technologies in its quality assurance checks. StockX allows only \u201cdeadstock\u201d items that are new and unworn at the time of sale (with the exception of refurbished watches and electronics).\n\nBalances liquidity and scarcity. StockX deals only with limited-edition and other rare items, rather than mass-produced goods. Items must be rare enough to create a desirable market, but at the same time, an item can\u2019t be so rare that there isn\u2019t enough data to track prices.\n\nActs as an intermediate. Buyers and sellers don\u2019t need to negotiate directly. When an item is sold, the seller sends the product to StockX authentication centers to be verified and sent to the buyer. The company does not release sale proceeds to the seller until items are authenticated; it also verifies payment.\n\n2015\u20132018: Founding and early history\n\nThe StockX story began in 2012 with Campless, an online database of sneaker sales data, which Josh Luber compiled using publicly available data from eBay. The \u201cCampless\u201d name originated from sneaker collectors who would camp out at retail stores ahead of certain limited releases. The database was designed to educate the growing legion of sneakerheads with pricing information in the resale market.\n\nThree years later, in 2015, Luber teamed up with two executives from Quicken Loans\u2014founder Dan Gilbert (who also owns NBA\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers) and chief operating officer Greg Schwartz\u2014along with creative-design entrepreneur Chris Kaufman to create a secondary market platform for sneakers, modeled after the U.S. securities markets. They launched the platform, which they named StockX, in 2016 with a focus on rare sneakers. By 2017 the platform had expanded into new categories, including streetwear and collectibles, capitalizing on the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of limited releases.\n\n2019\u20132024: Continued growth and celebrity buzz\n\nIn June 2019 Scott Cutler, former eBay and New York Stock Exchange executive, replaced Luber as CEO. That year StockX achieved \u201cunicorn\u201d status (i.e., a start-up valued at over $1 billion), fueled by substantial investments from venture capitalists such as DST Global, General Atlantic, and GGV Capital. The platform also added celebrity investors, including rapper Eminem, actor Mark Wahlberg, and model Karlie Kloss.\n\nStockX\u2019s growth accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the platform benefited from increased online shopping as consumers shifted more of their discretionary income to luxury goods. By 2021 the company\u2019s valuation reached $3.8 billion upon completion of a late-stage funding round.\n\nIn September 2024, StockX and Walmart (WMT) announced a partnership whereby StockX certified sneakers would be available for purchase on Walmart\u2019s website and mobile app. Two months later, Cutler announced he would be stepping down as CEO at the end of 2024, to be succeeded by cofounder Greg Schwartz.\n\nHow StockX is (and isn\u2019t) like a stock market\n\nStockX calls itself a \u201cstock market of things.\u201d It seeks to make the secondary market of buying and selling luxury goods more orderly compared to buying goods at a consignment shop or looking to snag a hot sneaker in a \u201cdrop.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s model has some similarities to financial markets:\n\nThe platform is set up like a stock market \u201corder book,\u201d with a dynamic bid-ask spread and prices that are influenced by market forces (supply and demand for particular items).\n\nStockX promotes data transparency by posting transaction history for goods on its platform.\n\nStockX serves as a transaction intermediary (like a clearinghouse in securities markets), vetting both buyers and sellers before transactions are complete.\n\nMany buyers and sellers treat their collections as portfolios.\n\nIn January 2019 StockX conducted its first initial product offering (\u201cIPO\u201d)\u2014an exclusive release of slide shoes designed by celebrity jeweler Ben Baller. Although the IPO concept was meant to parallel the initial public offerings of new shares of stock, the auction process more closely resembled that of a direct public offering (DPO). StockX has since conducted several more IPOs, including limited-release shoes from Adidas and New Balance, as well as other products.\n\nAlthough StockX bills itself as a stock market of things, there are a few differences:\n\nStockX is a platform for physical goods, rather than securities, which makes it more like a commodities market.\n\nBecause StockX focuses on collectibles rather than standardized securities or financial contracts, supply is limited\u2014sometimes nonexistent. The vast majority of stocks listed on U.S. exchanges enjoy a liquid and orderly market throughout the trading day.\n\nShares of stock are standard and fungible, whereas sneakers and other StockX goods are unique and must be authenticated before each transaction is complete.\n\nShare prices are determined by economic indicators and company fundamentals, while trends and consumer tastes drive prices on StockX.\n\nStockX legacy\n\nStockX\u2019s stock-market-like approach may be innovative, and the company has enjoyed a first-mover advantage, but other online platforms could mimic StockX\u2019s model. Just as there is the New York Stock Exchange, there is also the Nasdaq, and other securities markets. StockX\u2019s commitment to authenticity helped it stand out in the crowd of typical resellers, but like other platforms that deal in physical goods, it needs to stay on top of the ever-growing sophistication of counterfeiters to maintain customer trust.\n\nAs of the mid-2020s StockX has been expanding into different product categories and international markets where demand for limited-edition and rare items is also strong. However, because its sales depend on pop culture, trends, and tastes, its success will, to some degree, depend on its ability to adapt to consumers\u2019 preferences.",

            "content": "One of the more prominent hedge fund managers today, Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, has been one of the busiest lately. His investment vehicle recently made some big moves, to the point where Appaloosa's lineup of largest holdings has changed.\n\nLike other investment managers, Appaloosa is required to itemize its equity portfolio on a quarterly basis. The company's latest filing was submitted in mid-February. On the basis of that document, here are the hedge fund's top five stock positions.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nDeeply invested in more than one economy\n\nAs with the previous filing, the No. 1 slot belongs to a foreign company, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA). Despite a recent, 600,000-share sell-off, Tepper clearly remains bullish on longtime holding Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), as it occupies position No. 2.\n\nRounding out the top five is another Chinese e-commerce title, PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), followed by U.S. tech titan Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and utility Vistra(NYSE: VST). Here are the totals for the quintet, in terms of shares owned and market value at the time of the filing:\n\nStock No. of shares owned Market value (as of 2/10/25) Alibaba Group 11.8 million $1.0 billion Amazon 2.6 million $570 million PDD Holdings 5.4 million $519 million Microsoft 970,000 $409 million Vistra 2.7 million $372 million\n\nHedging by a hedge\n\nThis represents a shift from the previous quarter, when PDD Holdings was No. 2, with Amazon just behind in third place. A big sell-off in the latter was the key reason for the shift.\n\nThe other major development was the boosting of the Vistra stake, perhaps anticipating strengthening demand for power generation thanks to the heavy resource needs of artificial intelligence functionalities. From quarter to quarter, Tepper more than doubled Appaloosa's position in Vistra.\n\nThe striking element of the top five is its heavy tech slant. Yet, the stocks are a rather diverse collection of business concentrations and geographies. So Tepper continues to make sizable plays, but true to his and Appaloosa's nature, he's balancing them out somewhat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

These large investors added 2.82 billion XRP to their holdings in the last two months alone.\n\nThis represents a 6.5% increase in their collective holdings. The trend of whale accumulation has been ongoing for about a year, with these investors now owning a total of 46.4 billion XRP tokens.\n\nActive addresses on the XRP network have also seen a boost during March. Current activity levels are approximately six times higher than those observed in January and February of this year.\n\nThis increased activity stands in contrast to many other blockchain networks. Many competitors have seen a decline in user engagement over recent months.\n\nThe surge in active addresses may indicate growing retail interest in the cryptocurrency. More users are participating in transactions on the network compared to previous months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe recent price action is occurring within a technical pattern known as a symmetrical triangle. This formation is seen as a bullish continuation pattern by technical analysts.\n\nIf XRP breaks above the upper trendline near $2.35, technical analysis suggests a potential price target of $4.35 by June. This would represent a 75% increase from current levels.\n\n$XRP is trading within a triangle similar to December when it broke to the upside Does history repeat itself? \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/6TOjftzKsz \u2014 Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 21, 2025\n\nThe positive price movement gained momentum after the SEC dropped its appeal against Ripple on March 19. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that this development effectively ends the case that has been ongoing for over four years.\n\nIn addition to the SEC news, crypto exchange Bitnomial voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the SEC. The exchange then launched the first CFTC-regulated XRP futures contracts in the United States.\n\nFutures contracts allow traders to speculate on XRP\u2019s price without directly holding the asset. This typically increases market activity and deepens liquidity in the overall market.\n\nDespite these positive developments, Ripple still faces one legal hurdle. An injunction issued by Judge Analisa Torres restricts the company from selling XRP directly to institutional investors like banks and financial institutions.\n\nAccording to crypto lawyer John Deaton, this injunction could limit Ripple\u2019s ability to distribute XRP to institutional investors in America. This remains a challenge for the company moving forward.\n\nFollowing the announcement about the SEC dropping its appeal, XRP briefly surged from $2.3 to $2.6. This temporary spike even allowed XRP to briefly surpass Tether (USDT) in market capitalization.\n\nHowever, this position was short-lived. XRP has since given back some gains and currently trades around $2.40, with Tether reclaiming its position in the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nXRP previously experienced triple-digit percentage gains after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. This rally was driven by expectations of regulatory changes that would benefit the cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.51, showing an increase of more than 8% over the past seven days. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price recovery comes during a broader rebound in the crypto market.",

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 20, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alibaba BABA, Palantir PLTR and Vertiv VRT.\n\nWhat's Going On with These Popular Stocks?\n\nSeveral stocks have been gaining big attention as of late, a list that includes Alibaba, Palantir and Vertiv. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each to see how they presently stack up.\n\nAlibaba Shares Roar Back\n\nAlibaba shares have been notably strong since late January following news of its new AI model that claims to surpass DeepSeek. The company\u2019s EPS outlook remains bullish across the board, a big positive concerning near-term share movement.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nImportantly, its AI-related product revenue maintained a triple-digit year-over-year growth pace for the sixth consecutive quarter throughout its latest period. BABA\u2019s sales growth has overall shown a modest acceleration over recent periods.\n\nThe stock\u2019s recent momentum has undoubtedly been welcomed among shareholders following years of negative price action, up nearly 70% in 2025 alone.\n\nPalantir Posts Robust Results\n\nPalantir\u2019s latest set of results came in strong as well, exceeding headline expectations and posting serious growth. Sales of $828 million shot 36% year-over-year and, more impressively, 14% sequentially. The strong sales growth was headlined by a 43% move higher in Customer count, reflecting the snowballing demand the company has been witnessing.\n\nLike BABA, analysts have become bullish on PLTR\u2019s outlook, landing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). EPS is forecasted to soar 36% on 32% higher sales in its current fiscal year.\n\nPalantir also closed a record-setting $803 million of U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV), which shot 130% higher year-over-year and 170% sequentially. U.S. results were jam-packed with positivity, with Commercial and Government revenue growing by 64% and 45%, respectively.\n\nVRT Sales Growth Remains Stellar\n\nVertiv has continued to post rock-solid growth in its quarterly releases, with EPS soaring 77% on the back of a 26% move higher in sales throughout its latest period. The top line growth the company has witnessed has been stellar.\n\nImportantly, Vertiv upped its full-year 2025 sales guidance in its latest release, with the new midpoint reflecting roughly 16% year-over-year growth. The company\u2019s current fiscal year sales estimate has been experiencing positive revisions all over the past year, as shown below.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMany notable stocks have been gaining big attention as of late, a list that includes Alibaba, Palantir and Vertiv.",

            "content": "Alibaba is set for better times in 2025 and beyond.\n\n2025 has turned out to be the most exciting year for Alibaba's (BABA -0.87%) investors. The stock has surged 68% (as of this writing), reaching a level unseen since 2021.\n\nAfter ignoring the tech giant for years, investors are finally paying attention to it again, thanks to the stabilization of its financial performance and its prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nBut is Alibaba's stock still a buy after its recent rally? Let's explore further.\n\nThe worst could be over for the e-commerce business\n\nOnce a leader in the e-commerce scene, Alibaba has faced increasing competition from its younger peers like Pinduoduo and Douying in the last few years, resulting in almost no growth in the previous two years.\n\nYet, the tech giant has made several huge adjustments to its business model, such as shifting its focus from merchants to consumers, reducing prices, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve user experience. The pivot has delivered early results, suggesting that Alibaba is heading in the right direction.\n\nFor instance, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall grew their customer management revenue by 9% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024, driven by growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) and take-rate. Another indicator of improvement in customer satisfaction is the double-digit growth in their 88VIP members (the highest-spending consumer group on the platform) to 49 million in that quarter.\n\nWhile the local e-commerce business is picking up steam, the international e-commerce business continues its rapid expansion. Revenue surged 32% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024 . Alibaba's overseas expansion diversifies its revenue base and opens new growth opportunities. Better still, it favorably positions the e-commerce business to sustain its long-term growth rather than relying on just the Chinese market.\n\nCloud computing and AI present tremendous opportunities\n\nOne of the biggest current trends is the advancement and adoption of AI, which is set to create enormous opportunities for those who are prepared. According to Statista , the AI market is estimated at $244 billion in 2025 and could reach $827 billion by 2030.\n\nWhile most investors generally focus on leading companies in the U.S. when investing in AI-related companies, the rise of DeepSeek and Alibaba's latest partnership with Apple to integrate AI features into iPhones sold in China suggest that investors can no longer ignore the role of Chinese companies in this evolution.\n\nAs a leading technology company in China, Alibaba is well-positioned to capture a significant market share in the AI industry. It has the largest and most advanced cloud computing infrastructure in China, making it the natural choice for most companies looking for AI services.\n\nBesides, Alibaba has spent years developing its AI models, like Qwen, and has incorporated AI software into its business operations. Unlike many new start-ups still in the early stages of creating and perfecting their AI models, Alibaba already has plenty of experience using AI to solve its internal business problems, positioning itself well to offer these solutions to its external customers.\n\nTo capture this vast opportunity, Alibaba plans to invest more than $50 billion in the next three years to build the necessary infrastructure to support its growth. The company also aims to increase the research and development investment in developing AI foundation models and AI-native apps. In short, the tech giant is going all-in in the cloud computing and AI business.\n\nBut there are risks to consider\n\nWhile the uncertainties surrounding Alibaba's key businesses have largely dissipated, the company still faces risks that could affect its ability to create shareholder value.\n\nThe tech conglomerate has to deal with China-related risks, particularly regulatory, political, and geopolitical risks. This requires Alibaba to position its business in favor of the country's long-term interests, and may affect Alibaba's international business expansion.\n\nBesides, investors have to deal with uncertainties in sentiments, which can easily sway from positive to negative again. For example, if the Trump administration bans local funds from owning Chinese companies, investors would have no choice but to sell the stocks, even though the company may have solid long-term prospects.\n\nIn short, investors must accept the potential volatility of owning the stock, even though those factors may not be business-driven.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nAlibaba's recent financial performance suggests that the worst is over for the company. Its e-commerce growth has returned, and its cloud computing plus AI business is well-positioned for rapid expansion in the coming years.\n\nBesides, the stock trades at an undemanding valuation despite its recent rally. For perspective, Alibaba's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 2.5 times, lagging Amazon's P/S ratio of 3.3 times .\n\nInvestors willing to stomach China-related risks could consider buying Alibaba's stock to gain exposure to Chinese e-commerce and AI growth potential.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nDuring the latest episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his frustration over the negative outlook he believes the White House is projecting about the economy. He explained that while he felt a sense of optimism and wanted to get excited about positive developments in the stock market, he held back.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get excited, but you know what I had to do? I had to hold my breath because when this market\u2019s getting ahead of steam going, you know what you can bet on?

            "content": "In a March 14, 2025 paper, researchers from Alibaba\u2018s MarcoPolo Team explored the translation capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3, DeepSeeks\u2019s R1, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or xAI\u2019s Grok 3, positioning them as \u201cthe next evolution\u201d in translation beyond neural machine translation (NMT) and large language models (LLMs).\n\nThey explained that, unlike traditional LLMs, LRMs introduce reasoning capabilities that allow them to dynamically infer meaning beyond the text.\n\nReferring to LRMs as \u201cmultilingual cognitive agents,\u201d they claim these models are \u201creframing\u201d AI translation as a \u201cdynamic reasoning task\u201d rather than a simple text-to-text mapping.\n\nThe researchers investigated various translation scenarios and found that LRMs outperform existing LLMs in complex translation tasks such as stylized and document-level translation.\n\nNew Possibilities for Translation\n\nThey explained that LRMs first analyze the source text\u2019s style and intent before generating a translation. This reasoning-driven approach enables them to capture stylistic nuances more effectively than LLMs.\n\nHowever, it also introduces the risk of \u201cover-localization\u201d \u2014 where the model adapts too closely to the target language\u2019s stylistic norms at the expense of fidelity to the source text.\n\nAdditionally, LRMs use reasoning to unify context across paragraphs, a capability that significantly improves document-level translation. The researchers noted that LRMs enhance terminology consistency, pronoun resolution, tone adaptation, and logical coherence across longer texts.\n\n\u201cBy enabling translation systems to dynamically reason about context, culture, and intent, LRMs open up new possibilities for translation,\u201d they said.\n\nPromise in Multimodal Translation\n\nBeyond text translation, LRMs also show promise in multimodal translation, integrating textual and non-textual inputs such as images, according to the researchers.\n\nUnlike LLMs, which primarily rely on pattern recognition, LRMs infer relationships between different modalities, allowing them to gain better contextual understanding and resolve ambiguities.\n\nHowever, the researchers acknowledge that challenges remain, particularly in processing highly domain-specific visual content or sign language.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of LRMs is their self-reflection capability, which allows them to identify and correct translation errors during inference. This makes them more robust in handling noisy, incomplete, or ambiguous inputs compared to standard LLMs.\n\n2024 Slator Pro Guide: Translation AI The 2024 Slator Pro Guide presents 20 new and impactful ways that LLMs can be used to enhance translation workflows. $ 365 BUY NOWIncluded in our Pro and Enterprise plan.\n\nSubscribe now!\n\nInference Inefficiency\n\nAlthough \u201cLRMs represent a significant advancement over traditional MT systems and even LLMs,\u201d according to the researchers, inference efficiency remains a major challenge.\n\nTheir reliance on chain-of-thought reasoning improves translation quality but increases computational overhead and latency. \u201cThis inefficiency poses a barrier to real-time applications of LRMs,\u201d they noted.\n\nWhile the study highlights LRMs as \u201ca significant step forward\u201d in AI translation, the researchers concluded that \u201ctheir full potential has yet to be realized.\u201d\n\nAuthors: Sinuo Liu, Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, and Kaifu Zhang",

Let\u2019s take a closer look at each to see how they presently stack up.\n\nAlibaba Shares Roar Back\n\nAlibaba shares have been notably strong since late January following news of its new AI model that claims to surpass DeepSeek. The company\u2019s EPS outlook remains bullish across the board, a big positive concerning near-term share movement.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nImportantly, its AI-related product revenue maintained a triple-digit year-over-year growth pace for the sixth consecutive quarter throughout its latest period. BABA\u2019s sales growth has overall shown a modest acceleration over recent periods, as shown below.\n\nThe stock\u2019s recent momentum has undoubtedly been welcomed among shareholders following years of negative price action, up nearly 70% in 2025 alone.\n\nPalantir Posts Robust Results\n\nPalantir\u2019s latest set of results came in strong as well, exceeding headline expectations and posting serious growth. Sales of $828 million shot 36% year-over-year and, more impressively, 14% sequentially. The strong sales growth was headlined by a 43% move higher in Customer count, reflecting the snowballing demand the company has been witnessing.\n\nLike BABA, analysts have become bullish on PLTR\u2019s outlook, landing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). EPS is forecasted to soar 36% on 32% higher sales in its current fiscal year.\n\nPalantir also closed a record-setting $803 million of U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV), which shot 130% higher year-over-year and 170% sequentially. U.S. results were jam-packed with positivity, with Commercial and Government revenue growing by 64% and 45%, respectively.\n\nVRT Sales Growth Remains Stellar\n\nVertiv has continued to post rock-solid growth in its quarterly releases, with EPS soaring 77% on the back of a 26% move higher in sales throughout its latest period. The top line growth the company has witnessed has been stellar, as we can see illustrated below.\n\nImportantly, Vertiv upped its full-year 2025 sales guidance in its latest release, with the new midpoint reflecting roughly 16% year-over-year growth. The company\u2019s current fiscal year sales estimate has been experiencing positive revisions all over the past year, as shown below.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMany notable stocks have been gaining big attention as of late, a list that includes Alibaba BABA, Palantir PLTR, and Vertiv VRT.\n\nAll three stocks reflect plays on the AI frenzy, though BABA shares reflect a stronger play on an overall China recovery.\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

Alibaba\u2019s quarterly results showed the company was already benefiting from a recovery in its biggest market.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Hong Kong shares (HK:9988) jumped 4.9% to HK$142.10 by the midday break, underpinning a 1.8% rise in the Hang Seng index.\n\nA report from the Financial Times said that Alibaba, under CEO Eddie Wu, was pivoting heavily into AI. Wu reportedly told all divisions of the company that their 2025 performance will be evaluated largely on how they can leverage AI to spur growth.\n\nIn addition to its customer-end AI products, Alibaba is also looking at how AI can be applied to improve internal processes, the FT report said, especially in its core ecommerce units Taobao and Tmall.\n\nThe company- which recently released new versions of its Qwen AI model- is seen as a leader in China\u2019s AI industry, and is also among the country\u2019s biggest spenders on the technology.\n\nAlibaba has benefited greatly from increased interest in China\u2019s AI capabilities, especially after the release of DeepSeek earlier this year. The company\u2019s HK shares surged nearly 75% in value so far in 2025, and have shown little sign of slowing.",

            "content": "announced plans to invest RMB 380 billion in cloud computing and AI, reinforcing its technological leadership. Recent financial results showcased robust growth, with net income for Q3 2025 jumping significantly year-over-year and sales continuing to rise. Despite a write-off of RMB 6,171 million, the impact was lighter compared to the previous year. Concurrently, their aggressive share buyback program repurchasing 119 million shares illustrates a steadfast focus on enhancing shareholder value, a possible driver for the price rise of 69% over the last quarter. During this period, while the broader market saw fluctuations with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq under pressure from tech giants and economic uncertainties, Alibaba's positive developments appeared to offer resilience. Investors might view the company's strategic initiatives and financial health as insulating factors, contributing to its standout performance amidst volatile market conditions.\n\nNYSE:BABA Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past year, Alibaba's total shareholder return reached 105.03%, significantly outperforming the broader US market, which returned 10%. This robust performance can be attributed to several key factors. Alibaba's announcement in February 2025 of a RMB 380 billion investment in cloud and AI infrastructure likely bolstered investor confidence by reinforcing its technological advancements. Additionally, the establishment of the Alibaba E-commerce Business Group in November 2024, integrating platforms like Taobao and Tmall, and the strategic joint venture with E-MART Inc. in January 2025, aimed at expanding global channels, further cemented its growth trajectory and market reach.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba's aggressive share buyback program throughout 2024 signaled its commitment to enhancing shareholder value, coinciding with strong financial results. Net income for Q3 2025 rose significantly compared to the previous year, contributing to investor optimism. Despite a RMB 6.17 billion goodwill impairment in late 2024, the decreased impact compared to prior periods buffered the downside, maintaining the company's upward momentum in the market.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +18.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has lost 9.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +14.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 points to a change of +2.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.83 indicates a change of +23.1% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",

That ranks far ahead of major Silicon Valley firms \u2014 plus every member of the S&P 500 index. (See the table below.)\n\nStrong results and the successful launch of AI products have helped power the move. BABA announced the release of its Qwen machine-learning models on January 28, lifting prices on heavy volume. Earnings and revenue beat estimates four weeks later, pushing the stock to its highest level in more than three years. It consolidated there for about a month and continued upward yesterday.\n\nThis time the focus may be on China in general. The Asian country just announced a \u201cSpecial Action Plan to Boost Consumption.\u201d While details aren\u2019t yet clear, the program will aim to \u201cexpand domestic demand in all directions, enhance consumption capacity by increasing income and reducing burdens,\u201d according to Xinhua.\n\nMore news is expected at the China Development Forum March 23-24. There have also been reports of a meeting between executives and President Xi on March 28, which could further impact sentiment.\n\nChina vs U.S. Tech\n\nBABA vs Big Tech Company YTD% Alibaba (BABA) +74% CVS Health (CVS)* +49% Meta Platforms (META +3.3% S&P 500 -3.5% Microsoft (MSFT) -7.8% Amazon.com (AMZN) -11% Nvidia (NVDA) -11% Alphabet (GOOGL) -13% Apple (AAPL) -15% Broadcom (AVGO) -16% Tesla (TSLA) -41% *-Biggest gainer in the S&P 500 YTD.\n\nSource: TradeStation data\n\nThe news flow couldn\u2019t be more different on the other side of the Pacific. Apple (AAPL), the biggest U.S. tech stock, just had its worst week in 2-1/2 years after delaying the integration of AI with its Siri personal assistant. AMZN and Microsoft (MSFT) fell on weak guidance after announcing results. NVDA beat estimates, but a weak margin outlook raised concerns about demand and pricing.\n\nThose mixed numbers, following years of outperformance, has caused investors to shift capital from U.S. tech stocks to global markets including China. For example, Warren Buffett recently added to holdings in Japanese investment while calling domestic assets overvalued. JPMorgan strategist Mislav Matejka separately wrote that emerging-market stocks like Chinese technology could outperform if the U.S. economy slows. Europe has also benefited from plans to increase defense and infrastructure spending.\n\nBABA is the largest Chinese technology stock, and the best-performer this year. However others are gaining as well:\n\nPDD (PDD), the parent of Temu, has climbed about 33 percent this year. There hasn\u2019t been much news, but it announces results on Thursday morning.\n\nJD.com (JD), a general e-commerce company, is up 30 percent. Its last set of numbers on March 6 beat estimates.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) is sometimes called the \u201cGoogle of China\u201d because of its dominant position in search. It\u2019s up 21 percent this year \u2014 including a 9.2 percent rally yesterday after announcing new AI models.\n\nIn conclusion, BABA is leading a surge in Chinese technology stocks at the same time major U.S. names struggle. Traders looking forward see potential for further positive catalysts. They may also worry about more volatility as established megacap leaders struggle following years of relentless gains \u2014 especially with estimates for economic growth and earnings coming down.",

            "content": "Author | Liu Baodan, Zhou Zhiyu\n\nEditor | Zhang Xiaoling\n\nAs the killer feature for the rise of Pinduoduo, \"refund only\" was once regarded as synonymous with protecting user rights and was adopted by major e-commerce platforms. However, due to its harm to merchants' rights, it has been continuously revised or even canceled.\n\nFollowing Taobao and Tmall, 1688 has also joined this trend, which means that the Alibaba ecosystem is beginning to completely downplay \"refund only.\"\n\nRecently, 1688 announced at the \"Good Business Conference\" that it will fully cancel the \"refund only\" policy starting from late March. When handling transaction disputes related to product quality issues, the platform will determine based on the account's creditworthiness, subsidizing the affected party to accelerate dispute resolution and improve business efficiency.\n\n1688 primarily engages in B2B business, and the cessation of \"refund only\" reflects its intention to build a favorable business environment. This is also attributed to the development of AI technology, which is becoming the core driving force of the company.\n\nIn recent years, competition in e-commerce has become increasingly fierce, and Alibaba has entered a period of strategic adjustment, focusing on its two main businesses: e-commerce and cloud computing. In this adjustment, the long-standing supply chain advantages of 1688 have been recognized, and it has been selected by the Alibaba Group as one of the first strategic innovative businesses to receive investment.\n\nAfter more than 20 years of dormancy, 1688 is now embarking on a journey towards the stars and the sea of the AI era.\n\nCessation of \"Refund Only\"\n\nThe \"refund only\" policy, which once represented the intense competition in e-commerce, has ultimately faded from the stage of 1688.\n\nUnlike other platforms' revisions or corrections, 1688 has directly announced the complete cancellation of the \"refund only\" policy. Previously, when buyers found quality issues with products after receiving them and initiated a refund-only request, the platform would actively intervene in the handling without requiring the merchant's consent for a refund.\n\nMerchants were in a passive position. If merchants disagreed with the platform's handling results, they could protect their rights through an appeal process. If the appeal was successful, the platform would compensate the merchant accordingly.\n\nNow, 1688 will cancel the platform's active intervention in \"refund only for quality issues after receiving the goods.\" The determination will be made based on the platform's buyer credit system, and those who meet the requirements will be subsidized by the platform, with merchants not bearing any related costs. After the subsidy is completed, the product does not need to be returned.\n\nThe cancellation of \"refund only\" by 1688 indicates that competition in the e-commerce industry is beginning to move towards a de-involution phase, which is both a result of policy advocacy and a necessary requirement for the platform to create a healthy ecosystem.\n\nOn March 5, Luo Wen, director of the State Administration for Market Regulation, stated that in terms of platform rules, the principle of openness and fairness will be upheld to promote mutual benefit and win-win situations among all parties on the platform. In response to the prominent issue of platforms abusing the \"refund only\" rule, resulting in merchants losing both goods and payments, the platform will be urged to clarify the applicable scope and specific circumstances of the rules to protect merchants' legitimate rights and interests.\n\nFor 1688, canceling \"refund only\" is just part of building a favorable business environment. At the conference, 1688 announced that it will increase investment in three areas: platform rules, operational efficiency, and market competition. For example, in terms of operational efficiency, 1688 will leverage AI's understanding of the industry to help merchants publish products using natural language and images Commercial investment is also part of operational efficiency. Liu Kang, head of customer experience at 1688, stated: \"From the perspective of the business environment, we believe that a qualified marketing tool should have an ROI of 5:1, meaning that an investment of 1 yuan should generate 5 yuan in GMV. An ROI below 5:1 is unreasonable, indicating low operational efficiency.\"\n\nIn terms of market competition, 1688 emphasizes that competition should be healthy and orderly, with one measure being support for new products. Regardless of whether they are new or old merchants, as long as there are new products, support will be provided. \"We guarantee that today, at least 20% of all traffic on 1688 will be allocated to these new products.\"\n\n1688 will also incorporate the business environment into the company's systematic governance procedures. At the meeting, 1688 announced the establishment of a Business Environment Governance Committee, which will include core indicators such as platform rule optimization, market competition order maintenance, and operational efficiency improvement into the annual assessment system for relevant department heads, with a weight of no less than 30%.\n\nAt the same time, 1688 will fully launch supply upgrades, eliminating merchants with no inventory, poor service fulfillment capabilities, and high refund rates, allowing quality suppliers with competitive products, prices, and services to enjoy more certain business results.\n\nTo this end, 1688 will focus on supporting two types of quality supply: one is high-quality factories represented by \"specialized, refined, distinctive, and innovative\" and brand OEM factories; the other is suppliers with direct sources in core production areas.\n\nThe cancellation of \"refund only\" serves as a barometer, representing 1688's re-evaluation of the merchant ecosystem, enhancing competitiveness by stimulating the supply side, which is undoubtedly the right direction, although it still requires time and market validation.\n\nEnhancing Service Capability\n\nWhether for brand alternatives or factory goods, users are rapidly flocking to the 1688 platform, which is a remarkable phenomenon in the context of a plateau in internet user growth.\n\nAccording to data released by 1688, in 2024, the number of active buyers on the 1688 platform is expected to grow by 55% year-on-year. Among them, the number of active buyers in the drop shipping distribution model, which does not require worrying about inventory risks, is expected to grow by 75% year-on-year.\n\nWall Street Journal learned that by February 2025, the annual active buyer count (AAC) on the 1688 platform will exceed 100 million, setting a new historical high, with B-class buyers contributing about 90% of the platform's transaction volume.\n\nTo a large extent, the popularity of 1688 is closely related to the rise of live e-commerce platforms such as Douyin, Kuaishou, and Xiaohongshu.\n\nAccording to Lu Tao, head of user operations at 1688, in addition to the retail e-commerce seller group, the new buyers who have flocked to 1688 in recent years mainly come from Xiaohongshu bloggers, Douyin hosts, Kuaishou influencers, community group buying \"group leaders,\" as well as mothers, college students, and emerging white-collar workers trying side jobs and light entrepreneurship, along with flexible workers such as delivery riders and ride-hailing drivers.\n\nLu Tao further explained that these buyers have high-frequency demands on 1688, including sourcing quality goods, finding brand alternatives, and seeking factory customization, with high-frequency small purchases being their notable characteristic In order to attract buyers, 1688 is also trying to continuously enhance its service capabilities and has launched a new business called \"Yuanxuan,\" collaborating with factories to build brands and supply chains, thereby reducing buyers' decision-making costs.\n\nIn the past year, 1688 has focused on addressing procurement experience issues that received significant feedback from buyers. As of February 2025, the on-time delivery rate for merchants reached 98.6%, and automatic compensation implemented due to merchant performance violations has covered 85% of orders.\n\nAdditionally, 1688 has focused on rectifying issues frequently reported by buyers, such as negative responses from merchants, refusal to accept returns, forcing buyers to bear return shipping costs, and failure to fulfill refund commitments. Currently, approximately 96% of on-site orders have achieved a \"return shipping cost covered\" service.\n\nAccording to Wall Street News, starting in March 2025, 1688 will fully upgrade its APP, focusing on five major directions to comprehensively improve the buyer experience and enhance procurement efficiency using AI. This includes making it easier for buyers to find new products and quality supplies, achieving efficient procurement processes and precise decision support, simplifying inventory management for buyers, and continuously improving the buyer experience.\n\n\"Yuanxuan\" is also an important attempt by 1688, primarily doing two things: first, providing products of the same quality as major brands but at only one-third of the price, catering to household procurement and stockpiling needs, while innovating and improving the products.\n\nSecond, relying on 1688's offline selection centers and super factories, it aims to lock in factories with design, research and development, and rapid response capabilities, promoting the digital transformation of the supplier chain, allowing factories to engage in private label business. Insiders reveal that this business aims to serve buyers across the board and has similarities with the \"MM\" brand products of Sam's Club and the private label products of Costco.\n\nAt the meeting, 1688 announced that Yuanxuan will launch the \"Brand Supply Chain\" plan, which will initially focus on three core consumption scenarios: health, travel, and home, planning to create 100 super products in collaboration with factories using new AI technologies.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in 2025, 1688's Wow Customization will undergo a comprehensive upgrade, significantly enhancing the application of AI in the customization field. It is reported that \"Wow Customization\" is a service launched by 1688 to meet the market's demand for small-batch, personalized customization.\n\nSeize the Opportunity Period\n\nAs Alibaba's oldest business, the importance of 1688 within Alibaba has significantly increased.\n\nIn November 2023, 1688 was identified by Alibaba Group as one of the first strategic innovative businesses, adopting a more independent strategy to face the broadest market.\n\nIn the view of Alibaba Group CEO Eddie Wu, 1688 has a solid foundation and enormous potential for a second entrepreneurial venture in the new era. Starting with the most competitive Chinese manufacturing products, it is expected to extend from B2B business to procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers, while also possessing the service capability to support cross-border transactions.\n\nAfter more than a year of development, 1688 has already achieved significant results, with the number of buyers exceeding 100 million and the factory ecosystem improving. Wall Street News has learned from internal sources that 1688 not only strictly controls its commercialization rate but also clearly defines the operational principle of \"buyer experience first, seller business growth prioritized over platform revenue.\" 1688's confidence comes from being backed by the big tree of Alibaba. According to the plan, Alibaba Group will continue to invest in 1688 over a period of 3-5 years, which means that 1688 does not face financial pressure in the short term.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that 1688 can rest easy; the challenges it faces should not be underestimated. As a business that has been established for more than twenty years, 1688 needs to completely break away from past inertia, find and establish its unique advantages in the market, and translate this capability into performance growth.\n\nAt least for now, 1688's strategy has not yet reflected in its performance. As of the quarter ending December 31, 2024, the wholesale business in China where 1688 operates achieved revenue of 6.575 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 24%, which is basically flat compared to last year.\n\nThe era of AI is accelerating, and 1688 is also betting on a new future, which will be a thorny path to gold mining. If 1688 wants to win this battle, it must demonstrate real strength.\n\nRisk Warning and Disclaimer\n\nThe market has risks, and investment requires caution.

The hedge fund manager cited exceptionally low valuations and China\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans as key factors behind his investment thesis.\n\nRegulatory filings show Appaloosa Management increased its stakes in major Chinese e-commerce names during the fourth quarter of 2024, with Alibaba remaining among the fund\u2019s largest holdings.\n\nThe firm also boosted positions in PDD Holdings Inc.

Looking ahead, Alibaba remains well-positioned to take advantage of China\u2019s anticipated surge in AI demand, particularly following the launch of DeepSeek earlier this year. According to analysts, BABA stock has a Strong Buy rating.\n\nRecently, Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed stock also benefited from a broader rally in Chinese stocks, driven by expectations of increased stimulus from Beijing, particularly measures aimed at boosting consumer spending.\n\nAlibaba Goes All-In on AI\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Financial Times, Alibaba, under CEO Eddie Wu, is making a major shift toward AI. Wu has reportedly instructed all divisions that their 2025 performance will be assessed based on their ability to integrate AI for growth.\n\nThe report further stated that Alibaba is also exploring AI applications to enhance internal operations beyond its AI-driven consumer products, particularly within its key e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall.\n\nNotably, Alibaba is a key player in China\u2019s AI industry and one of its biggest investors in the technology.

Competing with AI tools like Butterfly Effect\u2019s Manus and OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research, Quark has been transformed into a comprehensive AI assistant. Powered by Alibaba\u2019s Qwen reasoning model, the revamped Quark now caters to general users, moving beyond its previous role as a search and cloud-storage tool.\n\nNotably, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, its suite of large language models, has emerged as a market leader in China. In a major endorsement, Apple (AAPL) has selected Qwen to power AI functions on iPhones sold in the country.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba made headlines earlier this month with its new open-source AI model, QwQ-32B, directly challenging DeepSeek\u2019s R1. Qwen claims QwQ-32B matches R1\u2019s output using just 5% of the parameters, showcasing its efficiency and innovation.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for BABA?\n\nOn TipRanks, BABA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 unanimous Buys assigned in the last three months.

            "content": "Shares of the China-based technology conglomerate Alibaba Group (BABA 4.55%) were gaining ground on Monday after the Chinese government said yesterday that it would implement a plan to boost consumer spending in the country.\n\nA significant part of Alibaba's business is focused on e-commerce, so the Chinese government's move could help boost the company's growth. Investors were optimistic about the opportunity and pushed Alibaba's stock up 4.8% as of 11:56 a.m. ET today\n\nA new plan for economic growth\n\nChina's government released its Special Action Plan to Boost Consumption on Sunday, highlighting a few areas that could help fuel economic growth. Specifically, the government wants to boost consumer spending, increase domestic demand, and even stabilize its stock market.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of data showing China's economy is slowing down. The country's consumer price index fell last month by its sharpest decline in more than a year. Its economy could suffer additional shocks if a trade war escalates with the U.S.\n\nAlibaba investors are hoping that the government working to improve consumer demand will help the company's e-commerce businesses. Its financials are in good shape right now, with net income reaching $6.7 billion in the most recent quarter, ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimates.\n\nBut with China being the world's second-largest economy, a consumer spending slowdown has had investors on high alert, wondering how much people might cut back in the future.\n\nUncertainty still ahead\n\nThere's a lot investors are trying to decipher right now. The Trump administration appears very focused on ratcheting up tariffs, even while temporarily pulling back on them at times. Any escalation of a trade war between China and the U.S. could put pressure on Alibaba's stock.\n\nAnd while the Chinese government's announcement sparked optimism among some investors, there's no guarantee its plans will indeed boost consumer demand. All of this means that Alibaba investors should keep a close eye on any new developments with China's economy.",

            "content": "The battle between Elon Musk and OpenAI just got more intense. A court has agreed to speed up its trial over OpenAI\u2019s shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit firm. This means the case will be heard much sooner than expected in the fall. Both sides agreed to the fast-track plan, but the move could favor one over the other.\n\nLight Up your Portfolio with Spark:\n\nEasily identify stocks' risks and opportunities.\n\nDiscover stocks' market position with detailed competitor analyses.\n\nFrom Non-Profit to For-Profit\n\nMusk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, left the group before it became a tech giant. The Tesla (TSLA) and X (formally known as Twitter) owner now runs his own AI firm, xAI, and is suing OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. Musk says OpenAI has turned its back on its goal to build AI for the good of all, not just to make cash. He claims Altman and his team used the nonprofit as a front to build a firm worth billions. OpenAI, on the other hand, says the shift was key to raising funds to keep up in the AI race. Altman has fired back, saying Musk is just mad he no longer has control.\n\nMusk must prove that OpenAI broke its word and tricked those who backed it early on. OpenAI will try to show that its move to a for-profit model was fair and needed. In cases like this, the side with a clear case and solid proof tends to win. A short trial may help OpenAI since Musk has less time to find a key piece of proof.\n\nReputation Risks\n\nIf Musk wins, OpenAI could face major changes. It might have to roll back its for-profit shift or take steps to show it still works for the good of all. That could shake investor trust and slow its growth. But if OpenAI wins, it will go full speed ahead with big funding deals, locking in its place as the leader in AI. Musk, who has faced heat since he took over as head of DOGE on Trump\u2019s team, risks another hit to his name if he loses.\n\nThis trial will set the stage for AI\u2019s future. Will it be in the hands of firms that prioritize cash, or will rules be set to keep AI true to its roots? The court will decide soon.\n\nTipranks\u2019 Comparison Tool\n\nUsing Tipranks\u2019 Comparison Tool, we gathered all publicly traded companies that developed an AI chatbot similar to OpenAI\u2019s Chat-GPT and xAI\u201ds GORK. Using the comparison tool, you can examine how these companies compare, which is on the up and claims a strong position in the sector, and which company is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "BEIJING: Chinese internet search giant Baidu released a new artificial intelligence reasoning model Sunday and made its AI chatbot services free to consumers as ferocious competition grips the sector.\n\nTechnology companies in China have been scrambling to release improved AI platforms since start-up DeepSeek shocked its rivals with its open source and highly cost-efficient model in January.\n\nIn a post on WeChat, Baidu announced the launch of its latest X1 reasoning model -- which the company claims performs similarly to DeepSeek's but for lower cost -- and a new foundation model, Ernie 4.5.\n\nBaidu also made its AI chatbot Ernie Bot free for individual users more than two weeks ahead of schedule. Previously, users had to pay a subscription to access the company's latest AI models via Ernie Bot.\n\nErnie 4.5 \u201coutperforms\u201d US-based OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 model in \u201cmultiple benchmarks\u201d, while Ernie X1 features \u201cenhanced capabilities in understanding, planning, reflection, and evolution\u201d, Baidu said.\n\nThe Beijing-based company was one of China's first to roll out a generative AI platform publicly, in 2023, but rival chatbots from companies such as TikTok owner ByteDance and Moonshot AI have since gained more users.\n\nBaidu faces stiff competition in the consumer-facing AI sector where startup DeepSeek shook up the industry at home and abroad with a model that performed comparably to competitors such as US-made ChatGPT, but cost much less to develop.\n\nSince then, Chinese companies and local government agencies have rushed to incorporate DeepSeek's open-source model into their work, while other technology companies have been playing catch-up.\n\nBaidu itself has integrated DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model into its search engine.\n\nIn February, WeChat owner Tencent released a new AI model that it claimed answers queries faster than DeepSeek, even as it incorporated its rival's technology into its messaging platform.\n\nThe same month, Alibaba, which has partnered with Apple to develop AI for the US company's phones in China, said it would invest 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) in AI and cloud computing over the next three years.\n\nAlibaba this month also released a new version of its AI assistant app powered by its open-source Qwen reasoning model.\n\nBaidu has also announced plans to follow DeepSeek's lead by making its Ernie AI models open-source from June 30.",

            "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL is reportedly facing internal turmoil as it struggles to fix major AI failures in Siri, with a top executive calling the delays ugly and embarrassing after the company prematurely marketed features that weren't ready.\n\nWhat Happened: During an all-hands meeting for Apple's Siri division, senior director Robby Walker acknowledged the frustration among employees over the repeated delays of key AI-powered Siri enhancements, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This was not one of those situations where we get to show people our plan after it's done,\" Walker told staff, referring to Apple's demonstration of its AI features at WWDC. \"We showed people before.\"\n\nSee Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Anthropic Pushes For Stronger US AI Safeguards, Saying Autocracies Like China, Russia Could Use AI To Expand Their Power\n\nWalker admitted that Apple's marketing team made the situation worse by promoting the upcoming Siri features in TV commercials and branding campaigns despite knowing they were not ready for launch.\n\nInitially expected in early 2024, the AI-powered Siri enhancements\u2014designed to improve personal assistant functionality, data integration, and app control\u2014have been repeatedly delayed due to performance issues.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nWalker said Apple found that the features only worked properly two-thirds to 80% of the time, meaning they failed one out of every three attempts.\n\nApple now aims to roll out the improvements in iOS 19, but Walker warned that even this timeline is uncertain, citing competing priorities within Apple's software and hardware teams.\n\nWhy It's Important: The delays highlight Apple's ongoing struggles in AI, particularly as competitors like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Microsoft Corporation MSFT advance rapidly.\n\nSiri has lagged behind rivals, and these setbacks reinforce concerns about Apple's ability to compete in the AI space.\n\nApple's AI missteps come as the company faces a 12.45% stock decline year-to-date amid broader market struggles.\n\nEarlier this week, Morgan Stanley raised concerns over Apple\u2019s AI delay, cutting its price target from $275 to $252.\n\nMeanwhile, in a bid to regain its footing, Apple has reportedly partnered with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA to enhance AI features in iPhones for the Chinese market. This collaboration could be crucial for Apple\u2019s efforts to reclaim market share in China.\n\nPrice Action: Apple\u2019s stock closed at $213.49 on Friday, rising 1.82% for the day.

            "content": "Tariffs and the threat trade wars pose on the global economy are weighing on the markets right now. How long this will last and how devastating the impact will be on businesses has many investors hitting the panic button.\n\nThere could, however, be some good, relatively safe stocks to buy amid all this turmoil. Three investments you may want to consider loading up on right now are Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA 0.88%), Visa (V -1.29%), and Axon Enterprise (AXON -4.18%). Here's why I think these stocks can outperform the market in the months and potentially years ahead.\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings\n\nPresident Donald Trump has put tariffs in place on imports from China, which will raise costs for many companies operating in the U.S. and that depend on Chinese goods. But for Chinese-based Alibaba, the tech company makes the bulk of its revenue in China, which means U.S. tariffs may not have much of an effect on its overall business.\n\nWhile they could still indirectly affect its operations due to worsening macroeconomic conditions, the business should still be in a much better position than many other companies. Of the $38.4 billion in revenue that Alibaba generated over the last three months of 2024, just $5.2 billion of that came from its international digital commerce group. U.S. sales will make up a portion of that, but the company doesn't specifically break out revenue by country on its earnings report. But one thing is for sure: Its e-commerce business is more heavily focused on the Chinese market.\n\nThis year, the Chinese government expects its economy to generate around 5% growth as it utilizes stimulus measures to help offset the impact of trade issues with the U.S. If it comes through and hits that number, Alibaba may be in a good position to do well this year.\n\nAlibaba's stock is trading just 19 times its trailing earnings, and it could make for a solid option for growth investors to load up on right now.\n\nVisa\n\nOne company that can do well regardless of macroeconomic factors is Visa. The credit card company will benefit whether businesses and consumers are spending money on domestic or international products. Even if economic conditions worsen globally, consumers may rely more heavily on their credit cards to fund their purchases than in the past.\n\nDuring the last three months of 2024, Visa's net revenue increased by a solid rate of 10%, with cross-border volumes up 16% year over year. The company generates fantastic profit margins of more than 50%, giving it a substantial buffer to still post strong earnings numbers even if its costs rise.\n\nWhile the stock trades at 35 times its trailing earnings, which can seem expensive given the company's mild growth rate, a premium is arguably warranted here given Visa's solid margins and strong leadership position in its industry.\n\nAxon Enterprise\n\nAxon isn't a cheap stock to own as it trades at a staggering 110 times its trailing earnings. But the reason I'm optimistic about its future is that with President Trump taking a tough stance on the border and overall law enforcement, Axon's business could stand to benefit from a sharp increase in demand. The company makes body cameras, sensors, tasers, and provides law enforcement with valuable software solutions.\n\nIts sales have more than doubled in just three years, growing from $863 million in 2021 to just under $2.1 billion this past year. And now, the company is also profitable as well. As it continues to scale, the bottom line should improve, which will result in its price-to-earnings multiple coming down, likely attracting more value-oriented investors in the process.\n\nMany investors may be worried about the impact of President Trump's aggressive stance on trimming costs and overhauling government spending, but one area that I believe may not be hit as hard is spending related to law enforcement, especially given the importance he is placing on securing borders and deporting illegal immigrants. Defense-related spending could very well increase over the next few years, and Axon may be well positioned to benefit from that.",

The updated version will integrate functions including a chatbot, deep thinking, task execution into a one-stop app, Alibaba said Thursday.\n\nThe chairman Joe Tsai emphasized in a recent column for the South China Morning Post that practical applications were key to maximizing intelligence in AI model development.\n\nLast Thursday, the tech giant unveiled QwQ-32B, its latest AI reasoning model, which it claimed \"rivals cutting-edge reasoning model, e.g., DeepSeek-R1.\"\n\nAlibaba last month announced a plan to invest $380 billion yuan ($52.5 billion) in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company claimed its Qwen AI has performed well in official benchmark tests and demonstrates the company's growing clout in the field.\n\nManus AI, created by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, on Tuesday revealed a strategic partnership with Alibaba. Developed by the Chinese start-up company Monica, Manus AI is a so-called general AI agent that claims it can deliver performance superior to that of OpenAI's AI agent, DeepResearch.\n\nExperts previously told CNBC that Alibaba has been making \"significant strides\" in advancing its AI cloud business. The company posted a sharp profit hike in the December quarter on the strength of its Cloud Intelligence unit and e-commerce segment.

Fascinated by the language of sport \u2013 particularly the under-appreciated art of translating clich\u00e9-speak.\n\nThe Chinese tech giant Alibaba is out to rival DeepSeek and OpenAI for supremacy in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, having last week released a new reasoning model that it says challenges those of both competitors.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Alibaba\u2019s AI drive has seen it partner with a fellow Chinese company that this month launched what it described as the world\u2019s \u201cfirst general AI agent\u201d.\n\n\u201cOnce-in-a-generation\u201d AI opportunity\n\nThe moves come on the back of Alibaba\u2019s announcement that it plans to invest $53 billion in advancing its AI capabilities over the next three years, with CEO Eddie Wu heralding the arrival of a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity.\n\nAlibaba, which launched its first reasoning model in 2023, revealed last Thursday that it was releasing its latest version, Tongyi Qianwen QwQ-32B, boasting that the model\u2019s performance is \u201ccomparable to DeepSeek-R1\u201d.\n\nQwQ-32B, which is available for internet users to download for free, \u201chas achieved a qualitative leap in mathematics, coding, and general capabilities\u201d, the company said in a statement.\n\nAlibaba added that the new model \u201ccan not only provide extremely strong reasoning capabilities, but also meet lower resource consumption requirements\u201d.\n\nIn January, in what has been described as a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d in AI, DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost, energy-efficient R1 reasoning model caused a global splash when it was released by the Chinese startup.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based firm said it had developed R1 at a cost of just $6 million - a fraction of the more than $100 million that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed it cost the American AI company to train its chatbot ChatGPT-4.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s announcement of QwQ-32B\u2019s release, Alibaba noted that the reasoning model\u2019s performance in benchmark tests \u201calmost completely\u201d surpassed OpenAI-o1-mini, the cost-efficient model rolled out by OpenAI last year.\n\nAlibaba links up with general AI upstart\n\nWhen it made its AI-investment pledge late last month, Alibaba added that the company\u2019s \u201cprimary long-term objective\u201d is the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nAGI is a highly autonomous form of AI capable of executing a wider range of tasks than standard chatbots, with fewer prompts.\n\nA general AI agent \u201ccan operate as a digital employee\u201d, according to a Reuters description.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, it emerged that Alibaba has entered into an alliance with the AI firm Manus, which last week released a general AI agent whose impact has been likened to that of DeepSeek, per MIT\u2019s Caiwei Chen.\n\nCurrently downloadable only by invitation, the agent \u201cbridges minds and actions\u201d, its developers say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just think, it delivers results.

Based on a web browser Alibaba introduced in 2016, it can handle tasks from image generation to travel planning, similar to what ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Doubao can offer to users, it said. The company posted a demonstration video that showed the app writing articles from pictures and generating minutes for meetings.\n\nNew Quark will be available to all users gradually, starting with a pilot launched Thursday. Its launch comes just a day after Alibaba launched an R1-Omni model that it said can read emotions. Both join a flurry of product updates and announcements from Chinese firms after Hangzhou-based DeepSeek stunned Silicon Valley with a model comparable to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, but apparently developed at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\u201cAs our model capabilities continue to evolve, we envision Quark as a gateway to endless possibilities where users can explore everything with AI,\u201d Wu Jia, CEO of Quark and an Alibaba vice president, said in the statement.\n\nCompetition on the AI applications front is rising. A Chinese startup made a splash last week with the Manus AI agent it claimed is capable of executing complicated tasks like analyzing stocks or writing marketing plans for users. The tool is also only open to select users so far.\n\nAlibaba accelerated efforts to carve out a leading position in AI after DeepSeek\u2019s splashy debut in January.\n\nThe ecommerce leader is now pushing out AI tools and apps in several arenas. It benchmarked its Qwen model against DeepSeek, secured a major partnership with Apple Inc. for AI on iPhones, and now aims to take on OpenAI as well.

On March 6, the gap touched 3.6 per cent, the biggest for the month. One ADR of Alibaba represents eight Hong Kong-traded shares. Alibaba owns the Post.\n\nThe premium for rival JD.com averaged 1.4 per cent in March, compared with the historical average of 0.16 per cent, while the discrepancy for electric-vehicle maker Li Auto has expanded to almost 1 per cent from 0.4 per cent, the data shows.

Photo: Xinhua\n\nThe wider price gaps align with an ongoing rerating of Chinese tech stocks, which have regained favour among investors after the rapid ascent of AI start-up DeepSeek fuelled optimism about China\u2019s competitiveness in the cutting-edge technology. The Hang Seng Tech Index has risen more than 30 per cent this year. Global investment banks including Goldman Sachs and China International Capital have said that the run-up has further to go.\n\n\u201cAs long as the momentum remains, the trend of wider premiums will carry on for a while,\u201d said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Huichen Asset Management in Shanghai. \u201cThat has a lot to do with sentiment and liquidity.\u201d\n\nOrdinarily, the gap between the two types of securities should be negligible due to the conversion mechanism. However, the recent widening is largely a result of diverging sentiment and fund flows in the two markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, investors are unsettled by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policies, stretched valuations of the co-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, and waning expectations about interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

            "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is stepping into the competitive AI landscape with its latest innovation, an artificial intelligence model designed to interpret human emotions. This new model, R1-Omni, developed by the team at Alibaba\u2019s Tongyi Lab, not only deciphers emotional states from videos but also provides detailed descriptions of individuals\u2019 attire and surroundings, elevating the realms of computer vision.\n\nIn a move to solidify its position in the AI sector, the e-commerce giant looks to outshine competitors like OpenAI. R1-Omni, an enhancement over the HumanOmni model by lead researcher Jiaxing Zhao, is now available for free download on Hugging Face, underscoring Alibaba\u2019s strategy of leveraging open-source platforms to foster innovation.\n\nThis initiative is a part of Alibaba\u2019s broader strategy following the attention-grabbing entrance of DeepSeek in the AI space earlier this year. The company is rolling out various AI innovations across diverse sectors, having already tested its Qwen model against DeepSeek and struck a partnership with Apple Inc. for AI integration on iPhones.\n\nThe concept of emotionally intelligent AI, where systems can interpret and react to human sentiments, is increasingly being embraced. Such technologies are evident in customer service chatbots that identify user frustration and Tesla Inc.\u2019s vehicles that detect driver fatigue.\n\nIn China\u2019s aggressive market, Alibaba is waiving fees for its latest AI advancement, enabling unrestricted access to R1-Omni. While current demonstrations depict the model highlighting broad emotional states like \u201chappy\u201d or \u201cangry,\u201d its ability to extract these from visual contexts signifies a notable leap in AI capabilities.\n\nEarlier this year, Alibaba had announced that its video generation artificial intelligence models can be used without cost. These models are the four open source models that are part of Wan2.1 series. Academics, researchers and commercial institutions around the world can now access them through Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Model Scope and Hugging Face to generate images and video from text and image inputs for free.\n\nEver since China\u2019s DeepSeek AI, which is also an open source model like Alibaba\u2019s, was released in January with the claim of using lower cost and less advanced chips, people around the world have been paying attention to open-source AI tech.\n\nOpen source AI is an AI system including code, algorithms, and datasets, that the public can download and modify freely. Its purpose is not to generate revenue but to accomplish other purposes like creating the community or improving the product.\n\nAlibaba released its first open source model in August 2023, and now is one of the most popular AI in the world, alongside DeepSeek\u2019s. Its share in Hong Kong this year went up 66% due to factors like having better financial performance, being a key AI player in the nation, and possibly receiving support from its president, Xi Jinping, for the domestic private sector.",

CNBC\n\nArtificial intelligence may eliminate the need for equity research analysts in the future, Alibaba's Chairman Joe Tsai said Wednesday at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore. \"Equity research analysts can be completely replaced ... you can ask it to put together a report on Nvidia or Apple, and it'll do a great job,\" he told CNBC's David Faber. That doesn't mean, however, that analyst roles will be eliminated altogether, he said during CNBC's two-day live event at Jewel Changi Airport. \"I don't think it'll entirely replace human beings. It'll just actually enhance the quality of work,\" he said. \"I think the quality of research can really be improved if a lot of the mundane research related stuff can be done by the machine, and then humans can apply their judgment and make better recommendations.\" AI also stands to fundamentally change the practice of law, he said, citing his own background as an attorney.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"When you write a contract ... the whole document has to fit well together, every sentence, every definition, has to fit with each other. Well, AI can do a lot of that, I would say most of it,\" he said. \"Does that mean in the future, lawyers will be replaced by AI? Not necessarily.\" He said that when clients hire \"sophisticated lawyers,\" they are really asking for counsel. \"Counsel is not something that is technical, or black and white \u2014 it is judgment,\" he said. \"I still think that these jobs can just be enhanced by AI rather than being replaced.\" AI has a total addressable market of at least $10 trillion, \"if not bigger,\" Tsai said at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE, noting that makes it bigger than industries like transportation and health-care insurance.\n\nAlibaba to benefit\n\nAlibaba is positioned to benefit from this proliferation of AI thanks to its cloud computing business, the chairman said. \"Every time someone trains and model or runs inference or do post training, they have they need cloud computing infrastructure,\" he added. Experts previously told CNBC that Alibaba has been making \"significant strides\" in advancing its AI cloud business. The company posted a sharp profit hike in the December quarter on the strength of its Cloud Intelligence unit and e-commerce segment. Tsai also said that Alibaba can also benefit a lot from AI within its own business, for example, by enhancing advertisements on its platforms.\n\nwatch now",

(BABA), as well as a micro-cap stock CSP Inc. (CSPI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\n\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+41.8% vs. +38%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\n\n\n\nThe launch of a first-party ad tech platform in Canada and ones in the remaining ad countries in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year. Raised revenue guidance for 2025 between $43.5-$44.5 billion reflects improved business fundamentals.\n\n\n\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +18.1%). The company\u2019s Q3 fiscal 2025 results benefited from the monetization of Taobao and Tmall Group, cloud businesses and AI-integrated products. BABA is riding on strong momentum in its international commerce retail business, driven by strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business is a positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past year.\n\n\n\nHowever, non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 per ADS fell short of estimates, suggesting a complex growth narrative. Current market valuations, with the stock trading at multi-year highs, suggest limited immediate upside potential.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of CSP have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. -18.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $151.07 million is facing risks which include weak growth in the high-performance products segment, dependence on low-margin IT solutions and continued operating losses despite revenue growth.\n\n\n\nHigh stock-based compensation, customer concentration risks and limited international reach add uncertainty. Investors must weigh CSP\u2019s cybersecurity potential against its ongoing profitability challenges. Nevertheless, CSP is transitioning toward high-margin, recurring revenue streams, driven by strong service revenue growth and increased demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s AZT PROTECT platform is gaining traction in critical infrastructure sectors, supported by key partnerships and a growing patent portfolio. A strong balance sheet with no long-term debt enables strategic investments, while its alliance with Rockwell Automation accelerates market expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Discover Financial Services (DFS), Veeva Systems Inc.

He said that people \"underestimate the importance\" of a recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and entrepreneurs, saying \"it gave private business people confidence to make investments in their business.\"\n\nSchneider Electric Chairman Jean-Pascal Tricoire spoke to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick Wednesday afternoon about the rapid rise of AI and its implications for sustainability.\n\nSingapore's Deputy Prime Minister Kim Yong Gan struck a bullish tone at the event, saying that Asia will remain a \"beacon of growth opportunities\" despite escalating global trade tensions.\n\nCNBC's inaugural CONVERGE LIVE event comes shortly after a nervy start to the week on Wall Street, with investors increasingly concerned that a global trade war could dent U.S. economic growth and trigger a recession.\n\nWorkers may need to 'pivot' six times or more in their careers: Singapore minister\n\nEmployees may have to \"pivot\" several times in their careers, according to Singapore's Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo.\n\n\"If we think that what they left school with is going to last them their entire working lives, I think that's not realistic,\" she told Arjun Kharpal at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE. \"In their 40, 50, years active in the workforce, they might well have to pivot three, four, five, six times, maybe even more.\"\n\nSingapore has a scheme supporting workers over 40 who want to gain new qualifications, Teo said, providing a monthly allowance of up to 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,250) for workers to take time off work to pursue eligible full-time courses.\n\n\"We think not just of the younger generation. We think of every generation,\" Teo said.\n\n\u2014 Lim Hui Jie; Lucy Handley\n\nESG and DEI are long-term commitments, not to be dropped because of politics: DBS's incoming CEO\n\nCompanies that have pledged to support ESG and DEI initiatives should stick to their commitments and not be swayed by political developments, the incoming CEO of Singapore's DBS Group said.\n\n\"Don't chop and change just because you're trying to ingratiate yourself with a new administration,\" Deputy CEO Tan Su Shan said during a session on corporate leadership at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nESG refers to environmental, social and governance factors, while DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered federal DEI employees be put on paid leave in January, with some companies updating their policies as a result.\n\nTan will become the bank's CEO from March 28, replacing Piyush Gupta who has led DBS Group \u2014 Southeast Asia's biggest lender \u2014 since 2009.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim; Lucy Handley\n\n\u2018Very good news\u2019: Schneider Electric hails the significance of China\u2019s \u2018DeepSeek moment'\n\nThe chairman of French power-equipment maker Schneider Electric says China's so-called \"DeepSeek moment\" is likely to be a positive development in the race to adopt sophisticated artificial intelligence models.\n\n\"I actually think its good news. We need AI at every level,\" Tricoire told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Wednesday.\n\n\"We need AI to optimize your whole enterprise at all levels, so that you can buy better, consume better, decide better, source better. To do all of this, we need models to operate on a smaller scale,\" he added.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\u2014 Sam Meredith\n\nAlibaba's Tsai, Salesforce's Benioff voice concerns about tariffs and trade wars\n\nThe trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs emerged as a key topic at CONVERGE LIVE, with speakers highlighting the risks to the global economy.\n\nAlibaba Chairman Joe Tsai warned of the disruption to trade, noting that U.S. and Chinese companies bought and sold billions of dollars' worth of products from one another. \"I think the Trump administration will want to have more American companies doing business in China and making money there,\" he said.\n\nHe added that while Trump's broad-based tariffs may be a negotiating ploy, Chinese electric vehicles will most likely be subjected to tax to protect the U.S. automobile industry.\n\nMarc Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, said demanding reciprocity in tariffs can be a good thing, but stressed the \"what\" and \"how\" needed to be put together in a consistent, clear and meaningful way to reduce volatility and conflict.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nAnt's international unit sees value in blockchain \u2014 but not crypto\n\nAnt International, the global arm of China's Ant Group, is embracing blockchain technology to help ease the flow of cross-border money transfers \u2014 but it's not touching crypto, according to President Douglas Feagin.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC's Sara Eisen, Feagin said that Ant International is working with partners like JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Citibank and HSBC to tokenize deposit claims against banks. However, as a company, it's not doing anything with cryptocurrencies specifically, he added.\n\n\"We continue to monitor [crypto] very closely,\" Feagin said. \"We see the things akin to crypto, like blockchain-based finance and also tokenized deposits, as becoming a very big factor in terms of global money transfer.\"\n\n\"We see these kind of solutions, largely kind of blockchain-based solutions, as improving the efficiency of money transfer, and we'll see how crypto evolves that in the long run,\" he added.\n\nAnt International was spun off from its parent company Ant Group in March 2024 and now operates as an independent subsidiary with its own board.\n\n\u2014 Ryan Browne\n\nRisk of U.S. recession has increased because of tariffs: Pimco managing director\n\nTariffs have increased the likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2025, according to Alec Kersman, managing director and head of Asia-Pacific at investment management firm Pimco.\n\nThere is a \"maybe 35% probability\" of a recession, Kersman told CNBC's Martin Soong, speaking at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore on Wednesday. That's up from the approximately 15% chance that Pimco estimated in December 2024 as the repercussions of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs take effect.\n\n\u2014 Lucy Handley, Yeo Boon Ping\n\nAI development needs to start with users and their needs: Microsoft executive\n\nThere needs to be less focus on AI models and more on how the technology can be used to help users do their jobs better, a Microsoft executive said.\n\nThis was one of the points made by Dean Carignan, AI innovation lead at Microsoft's Office of the Chief Scientist, during a panel discussion at CONVERGE LIVE. Carignan downplayed the risks of AI eliminating jobs, noting that machines cannot replicate the human-to-human interactions needed to manage and motivate staff.\n\nGuy Diedrich, senior vice president and global innovation officer at Cisco, said that job descriptions are \"passe,\" and the firm is focusing on workflows instead.\n\n\"When you talk about workflows, then the worker actually has a role in whatever job is coming up. So you may have workflows where a part of that job is performed by human, then another part of the workflow is AI. Another part of the workflow is by a robot,\" Diedrich said during the panel discussion.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim, Lucy Handley\n\nPanelists discuss 'profit with purpose' for long-term success\n\nAmid concerns about trade wars and falling stock prices, two speakers at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE urged companies to think long term and focus on doing good.\n\nRajeev Peshawaria, CEO of Stewardship Asia Centre, said there was a clear link between longevity and steward leadership, which is the desire to create a collective better future for society and future generations. He cited companies such as India's Tata Group and Germany's Faber-Castell.\n\nHarald Link, chairman of Thailand's B Grimm Group, said companies performed better if staff liked each other rather than viewed one another as competitors, and shared a common vision about what they could do together for society.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nAsia, Europe benefiting from fund flows from U.S., says CFO of SGX\n\nGlobal investors have begun moving funds out of the United States to Asia and Europe, according to Daniel Koh, CFO of the Singapore Exchange.\n\nSpeaking at a panel discussion titled \"Managing Volatility: Capital Flows in 2025,\" Koh said SGX's widely traded China A50 Index Futures, which offers investors access to 50 major Chinese A-shares, have seen flows rise by 20% on year since the start of 2025.\n\nThere is also increased activity in the Singapore bourse operator's Asian FX futures, with over one-third of trades taking place during the Western time zone, he added.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nEurope could be the 'epicenter of nuclear energy,' CEO says\n\nNuclear power may see a revival in Europe as countries strive to achieve energy independence.\n\nSpeaking at a panel discussion on \"Exploring Global Investing Trends in 2025 and Beyond,\" Kamal Bhatia, president and CEO of Principal Asset Management, said Europe could be the \"epicenter of nuclear energy\" as the EU works to reduce its dependence on imported oil and gas.\n\nHe added that the safety of nuclear energy has increased by leaps and bounds over the last 20 to 30 years.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nXi's meeting with entrepreneurs was a confidence boost, Alibaba's Tsai says\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping's meeting with entrepreneurs last month gave businesses confidence to make investments, Alibaba Group Chairman Joe Tsai said.\n\n\"People underestimate the importance of that meeting,\" he said at CONVERGE LIVE. \"What that meeting did to the entire entrepreneur sector, or ... the private business sector, is it gave private business people confidence to make investments in their business.\"\n\nLast month, Xi held a closed-door symposium with some of the country's most prominent business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma, in a rare show of support for the sector.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Anniek Bao\n\nAlibaba's Joe Tsai says research analysts 'can be completely replaced by AI'\n\nAlibaba Chairman Joe Tsai warns that research analysts \"can be completely replaced by AI.\"\n\nHis comments came during a discussion about developments in AI and the likely disruption to labor markets.\n\nRather than compete with AI, analysts can let AI systems retrieve and process the information and use their human judgement to enhance the quality of research.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nAlibaba's Joe Tsai says NBA, NFL franchise values can rise further\n\nAlibaba Chairman Joe Tsai said the value of major sports franchises like the NBA and NFL will continue to grow as teams increase the size of their global fanbase.\n\nAs long as teams can grow their fanbase, there are \"lots of upside,\" he said.\n\nTsai added, however, that he would not invest in European soccer, despite its popularity, due to the lack of a salary cap and competition with sovereign wealth funds for investments.\n\nTsai owns several sports teams, including the Brooklyn Nets, and he has a minority stake in the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\n\n\nDalio: China ahead of U.S. in AI applications\n\nFamed hedge fund manager Ray Dalio said that while the U.S. remains ahead of China in designing and producing the best semiconductors, China is ahead in the application and usage of AI.\n\n\"China is behind, but not by a lot, in the best chips,\" he said during a panel discussion. But the Chinese were better at making them working together.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nDalio warns of a 'severe' U.S. supply-demand debt problem\n\nBridgewater founder Ray Dalio on Wednesday warned that a \"very severe\" U.S. supply-demand problem regarding debt could lead to \"shocking developments.\"\n\n\"The first thing is the debt issue, we have a very severe supply-demand problem,\" Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore.\n\nDalio said the U.S. deficit needs to go from a projected level of 7.2% of gross domestic product to about 3% of GDP.\n\n\"That's a big deal. You are going to see shocking developments in terms of how that's going to be dealt with,\" he added.\n\nHis comments come amid a tariff roller-coaster ride for markets in recent days. Trade policy uncertainty has added to a sense of unease on Wall Street, with investors concerned about the impact of a brewing trade war on the global economy.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\u2014 Sam Meredith\n\nSalesforce's Benioff describes data centers as commodities in the global AI rollout\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff described the data centers that companies are rushing to build as \"commodity centers,\" noting that the cost of using such centers has never been so low.\n\nSalesforce will take advantage of the low costs to hyperscale its AI applications, he added, during a panel discussion at the CONVERGE LIVE forum taking place at Singapore's Changi Airport.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nSingapore deputy PM says many in Asia concerned about Trump's tariffs\n\nSingapore Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said many in Asia are \"watching with anxiety\" U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, citing the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the country's three largest trading partners.\n\nHe added that countries in Southeast Asia remain committed to free trade, citing agreements such as the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) to reduce trade and technical barriers between member countries.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Lim\n\nSalesforce to invest $1 billion in Singapore over the next five years\n\nBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSalesforce on Wednesday announced plans to invest $1 billion in Singapore over the next five years.\n\nThe company said the investment is designed to accelerate the country's digital transformation and the adoption of Salesforce's flagship AI offering Agentforce.\n\nAlongside Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is scheduled to speak at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE at around 9:25 a.m. Singapore time (9:25 p.m. ET) on Wednesday.\n\n\"Salesforce's initiatives in AI research and workforce development will strengthen our ecosystem by catalysing innovation for key industries and corporates based in Singapore,\" Jermaine Loy, managing director of the Singapore Economic Development Board, said in a statement.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\u2014 Sam Meredith\n\nAI, tariffs and recession: The hot topics for business leaders at CONVERGE\n\nThemes expected to dominate discussions on the first day of CONVERGE LIVE include artificial intelligence, a wide-ranging trade war and heightened fears of a U.S. recession.\n\nAI \u2014 a talking point for every major corporate leader in recent years \u2014 has been in sharp focus as the race to develop sophisticated AI systems heats up. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba recently unveiled a new AI model, which it says \"rivals\" other reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1. CNBC is not able to verify these claims.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. stocks fell sharply at the start of the week amid deepening fears U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy could result in a U.S. recession.\n\nAn escalating trade war has seen several tariff announcements from the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico in recent months.\n\n\u2014 Sam Meredith\n\nGuest highlights for Wednesday\n\nGerry Miller | CNBC\n\nHigh-profile business leaders, policymakers and investors will take part in several panel sessions and firesides at CONVERGE LIVE on Wednesday.\n\nSingapore's Deputy Prime Minister Kim Yong Gan kicks off the event with a keynote speech at around 9:10 a.m. Singapore time (9:10 p.m. ET).

That score shows how the C930 meets the requirement for RISC-V systems in high-performance computing applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the chip's launch last month, Damo claimed that its IC design team has supported implementation of \"more than 30 per cent of RISC-V high-performance processors\". The Alibaba research arm previously rolled out several RISC-V-based processors under its XuanTie series, including the C920 last year and the C910 in 2019.\n\nDamo also announced plans for new XuanTie processors including the C908X, R908A and XL200. These chips are designed for AI acceleration, automotive applications and high-speed interconnection, respectively.\n\nBefore Alibaba's sharpened focus on RISC-V, chips built on that architecture became popular for relatively low-end applications such as in earphones and headphones. RISC-V adoption for processors used in laptops and servers were marginal.\n\nMeanwhile, China is expected to double down on its support for RISC-V semiconductor development. China plans to issue guidance to encourage the use of open-source RISC-V chips nationwide for the first time, according to a Reuters report last month, which cited sources briefed on the matter.

With advancements like DeepSeek and potential infrastructure support for emerging AI platforms, Alibaba is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\nLast week, Alibaba made headlines by unveiling its new open-source AI model, QwQ-32B, through its AI unit Qwen, directly challenging DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model. Qwen claimed that QwQ-32B delivers similar output while utilizing just 5% of the parameters compared to DeepSeek\u2019s model, highlighting its efficiency and innovation in AI development.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Cloud Computing Strength Fuels Bullish Outlook\n\nWhile AliExpress, Alibaba\u2019s online marketplace, remains popular in the U.S. for its bulk pricing, Alibaba\u2019s true strength lies beyond retail\u2014its growing cloud computing footprint. Last month, Alibaba unveiled a $53 billion investment plan over the next three years to strengthen its AI and cloud computing infrastructure. This commitment exceeds its total spending in the sector over the past decade.\n\nOn top of that, Alibaba\u2019s integration of AI into its cloud business continues to drive strong revenue growth. For six consecutive quarters, AI-related product revenue has recorded triple-digit year-over-year growth. As industries increasingly adopt AI solutions, demand for Alibaba Cloud services remains strong, with expectations for continued momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, its expanding data centers further enhance its ability to leverage consumer insights, much like Amazon (AMZN).\n\nDaiwa Reaffirms Buy Rating on BABA Stock\n\nLast week, analyst John Choi at Daiwa reiterated his Buy rating on BABA stock, driven by its cloud business prospects. Meanwhile, Choi raised the price target for Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares (HK:9988) from HK$165 to HK$175.\n\nChoi noted that after DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthroughs during the Spring Festival, demand for AI inference has soared, causing a cloud supply shortage. Choi also stated that the company\u2019s higher capital expenditure compared to peers is expected to strengthen its position in the cloud market, supporting future growth and a potential re-rating of its cloud business. Consequently, Daiwa raised its FY26 cloud revenue growth forecast to 20% and increased its capital expenditure estimates to \u00a5126 billion for FY26 and \u00a5139 billion for FY27.\n\nIn addition, Daiwa increased its FY25-FY27 earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for BABA by 1-3%, citing cloud revenue growth and expanded cross-selling opportunities.\n\nInsights from TipRanks\u2019 Bulls Say, Bears Say\n\nTipRanks\u2019 \u201cBulls Say, Bears Say\u201d tool provides insights into analysts\u2019 perspectives on Alibaba\u2019s stock.\n\nApart from AI adoption and cloud growth, optimistic analysts highlight the active share buyback program. Alibaba\u2019s share repurchase program remains active, with $20.7 billion authorized for buybacks through March 2027. This ongoing initiative could strengthen its stock position and enhance shareholder value.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Good Buy Now?\n\nOn TipRanks, BABA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys assigned in the last three months. At $165.61, the Alibaba share price target implies a growth rate of 17.7% on the current trading price.\n\nSee more BABA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

over three quarters of businesses (76 percent) across Asia, Europe and the Middle East are intrigued by the potential of digital technologies, including AI and cloud computing in driving sustainable

tools with the Middle East feel the strongest at 91 percent, followed by emerging Asian markets at 83 percent, Europe at 82 percent and developed Asian markets at 74 percent.\n\nHowever, the survey

More and more enterprises are using data centers to host or manage computing infrastructure for their AI projects.\n\nThe facility in Mexico was launched six days after Alibaba Cloud announced in mid-February that it would commence operations at its second data center in Thailand to meet the country's growing demand for cloud computing services and support generative AI applications.\n\nThe company opened its first data center in Thailand in 2022 and this latest expansion follows the company's announcement in May that it would expand its data center network across Asia, including Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and a cloud region in Mexico.\n\nThe data center in Thailand has not only played a pivotal role in supporting Thai businesses across a diverse array of sectors, including technology, media, retail, fintech and public services, but also helped local enterprises enhance operational efficiency and accelerate digital transformation.\n\nAlibaba Group recently announced that it would invest more than 380 billion yuan ($52.3 billion) in building cloud and AI hardware infrastructure over the next three years.\n\n\"Our planned investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next three years is set to exceed what we have spent over the past decade,\" said Wu Yongming, CEO of Alibaba Group, in an earnings call with investors in February.\n\nWu noted that the company will increase investment in the research and development of AI applications and computing power, and deeply integrate AI across its businesses to capture new growth opportunities in the AI era.\n\nTencent Cloud, Tencent Holdings Ltd's cloud computing arm, is stepping up the push to help overseas enterprises realize digital transformation by leveraging AI-powered cloud services.\n\nThe company recently announced that it will build its first Middle East data center in Saudi Arabia, with a total investment of more than $150 million in infrastructure construction over the next few years, marking a significant step in the company's global expansion.\n\nHu Dan, vice-president of Tencent Cloud International for the Middle East and North Africa, said the new data center will strengthen the company's ability to support Saudi Arabia's digital transformation journey across key sectors, including digital media and streaming, video gaming, esports, e-commerce, tourism, financial services and telecommunications.\n\nPan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, which is part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said Chinese enterprises that are making forays into overseas cloud service markets should not only improve the construction of cloud infrastructure abroad, but also enhance innovative capacities in key software applications, so as to better serve global clients.\n\nAccording to global market consultancy Canalys, global cloud infrastructure services spending stood at $321.3 billion in 2024, rising 20 percent year-on-year. The key driver behind this growth was the expansion of AI models, which significantly accelerated cloud adoption.\n\nCanalys has forecast that spending on global cloud infrastructure services will grow 19 percent year-on-year in 2025. As AI becomes more efficient and widely adopted, demand is expected to grow exponentially. In response, cloud service providers are making significant investments to grow AI model training, deployment and cloud-based applications globally, the consultancy added.",

This model is reported to perform comparably to DeepSeek\u2019s R1, despite having fewer parameters, which has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike.\n\nThe company\u2019s strategic focus on AI development has been a key driver of its stock performance. Analysts have upgraded Alibaba\u2019s stock rating, citing its promising AI infrastructure investments and the potential for improved earnings. This positive sentiment has been further bolstered by the company\u2019s share repurchase activities, which aim to enhance shareholder value and market positioning.\n\nIn addition to its AI advancements, Alibaba\u2019s stock has been buoyed by broader market dynamics, including China\u2019s reaffirmation of its 2025 growth targets. These factors, combined with strategic capital allocation and a favorable industry structure for AI, have positioned Alibaba as a leading player in the tech sector, attracting increased investor interest and confidence.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

A similar pattern appeared for Baidu Inc. and NetEase Inc., with their American depositary receipts trading at their cheapest against Hong Kong peers in five months.\n\nThe divergence, which follows Trump\u2019s Feb. 21 directive to tighten scrutiny of pension funds\u2019 investments into Chinese stocks, is an aberration that some analysts warn could become more common as the US president takes an increasingly hawkish stance toward China.\n\nWhile arbitrageurs have strong incentives to keep prices in the two markets aligned, investor flows can vary dramatically if US institutions face regulatory pressure to sell at a time when counterparts in Hong Kong are buying on optimism over the artificial intelligence boom. It points to what could become a longer-term trend of financial decoupling between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\n\u201cIf any US policy requires certain types of US investors to divest their holding in certain Chinese stocks, and as US investors\u2019 positions are more concentrated in ADRs, ADRs could see persistent flow-selling,\u201d said Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist of BofA Securities in Hong Kong. \u201cHong Kong shares could be relatively immune.\u201d\n\nWhile a midweek surge in ADRs \u2014 following Beijing\u2019s forceful economic growth goal and a promise to prioritize consumption \u2014 has reduced their discount for this week, the gap could widen should Trump amp up his tough stance against China.\n\nOn Friday, Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares edged lower, erasing a gain of as much as 3.6% in Hong Kong. Still, its stock has rallied around 80% since a January low. Meanwhile, its American Depositary Receipts rose 3.2%.\n\nRead: China Sets Bullish Growth Goal of About 5%, Despite US Tariffs\n\nInvestors are reminded of the episode in 2022, when bilateral tensions pushed Chinese firms to the brink of a mass delisting from US exchanges. That year, Alibaba\u2019s shares in New York traded at a discount more frequently than at a premium to those in Hong Kong, at one point widening to nearly 8%.",

            "content": "Just two months after the tech world was upended by the DeepSeek-R1 AI model, Alibaba Cloud has introduced QwQ-32B, an open source large language model (LLM).\n\nThe Chinese cloud giant describes the new model as \u201ca compact reasoning model\u201d which uses only 32 billion parameters, yet is capable of delivering performance comparable to other large language AI models that use larger numbers of parameters.\n\nOn its website, Alibaba Cloud published performance benchmarks which suggest that the new model is comparable to AI models from DeepSeek and OpenAI. These benchmarks include AIME 24 (mathematical reasoning), Live CodeBench (coding proficiency), LiveBench (test set contamination and objective evaluation), IFEval (instruction-following ability), and BFCL (tool and function-calling capabilities).\n\nBy using continuous reinforced learning (RL) scaling, Alibaba claimed the QwQ-32B model demonstrates significant improvements in mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency.\n\nIn a blog post, the company said QwQ-32B, which uses 32 billion parameters, achieves performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1, which uses 671 billion parameters. Alibaba said that this shows the effectiveness of RL when applied to robust foundation models pretrained on extensive world knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe have integrated agent-related capabilities into the reasoning model, enabling it to think critically while utilising tools and adapting its reasoning based on environmental feedback,\u201d Alibaba said in the blog post.\n\nAlibaba said QwQ-32B demonstrates the effectiveness of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning capabilities. With this approach to AI training, a reinforcement learning AI agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, as well as take actions and learn through trial and error. Reinforcement learning is one of several approaches developers use to train machine learning systems. Alibaba used RL to make its model more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe have not only witnessed the immense potential of scaled RL, but also recognised the untapped possibilities within pretrained language models,\u201d Alibaba said. \u201cAs we work towards developing the next generation of Qwen, we are confident that combining stronger foundation models with RL powered by scaled computational resources will propel us closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence [AGI].\u201d\n\nAlibaba said it is actively exploring the integration of agents with RL to enable what it describes as \u201clong-horizon reasoning\u201d which, according to Alibaba, will eventually lead to greater intelligence with inference time scaling.\n\nThe QwQ-32B model was trained using rewards from a general reward model and rule-based verifiers, enhancing its general capabilities. According to Alibaba, these include better instruction-following, alignment with human preferences and improved agent performance.\n\nChina\u2019s DeepSeek, which has been generally available since the start of the year, demonstrates the effectiveness of RL in its ability to deliver comparable benchmark results compared to rival US large language models. Its R1 LLM can rival US artificial intelligence without the need to resort to the latest GPU hardware.\n\nThe fact that Alibaba\u2019s QwQ-32B model also uses RL is no coincidence. The US has banned the export of high-end AI accelerator chips \u2013 such as the Nvidia H100 graphics processor \u2013 to China, which means Chinese AI developers have had to look at alternative approaches to making their models work. Using RL does appear to deliver comparable benchmark results compared with what models like those from OpenAI are able to achieve.\n\nWhat is interesting about the QwQ-32B model is that it uses significantly fewer parameters to achieve similar results to DeepSeek, which effectively means that it should be able to run on less powerful AI acceleration hardware.",

            "content": "Following DeepSeek and Manus, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba launched its new AI model QwQ-32B on March 6.\n\nBy Ada Jain\n\nJust a little over two months into 2025, China has seen multiple AI advancements including the launch of DeepSeek in January \u2014 compared to the \u201cSputnik moment\u201d of the United States\u2019 AI development \u2014 highlighting China\u2019s ability to create functional Large Language Models (LLMs) at a lower cost than leading American companies. Following DeepSeek, Manus AI showed that such advancement can be replicated.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s new AI model QwQ-32B\n\nIn the same week of Manus\u2019 release, Alibaba is back in the AI race with QwQ-32B, short for Qwen-with-Questions, claiming it is comparable to DeepSeek\u2019s R1. The initial version of QwQ was released back in November 2024.\n\nThe latest iteration, QwQ-32B has only 32 billion parameters and yet its performance is claimed to be on par with DeepSeek-R1, which has 671 billion parameters. Alibaba claims the model has achieved a qualitative leap in mathematics, coding, and general capabilities, boosting its Hong Kong shares by 8% and positively impacted the Hang Seng\u2019s China Enterprises Index.\n\nREAD: China disrupts AI market with DeepSeek: A better, cheaper version of ChatGPT? (January 27, 2025)\n\nAlibaba, the owner of Chinese e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, first launched its ChatGPT-equivalent service Tongyi Qianwen in 2023. The growing competition between the U.S. and China in AI is not just reshaping bilateral relations but also redefining the global balance of power.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Manus is also the creation of a Chinese company called Monica. Manus achieved SOTA (State-of-the-Art) results in the GAIA benchmark test, demonstrating performance that surpasses OpenAI\u2019s models of the same level. One key feature of Manus is its asynchronous cloud-based operation, allowing users to close their devices while the AI continues working, providing results upon completion.\n\nThe US-China AI race\n\nIn 2017, through its Next Generation AI Development Plan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) declared AI a cornerstone of its economic transformation strategy, aiming to position AI as a fundamental catalyst for economic change by 2025 and establish China as the global leader in AI by 2030 to challenge and surpass the U.S.\n\nIn response, the U.S. imposed a range of trade restrictions, export controls and tariffs on Beijing in an effort to impede China\u2019s AI marathon and protect its economic and defense concerns. With such measures, the U.S. aims to limit China\u2019s access to critical AI-related technologies, particularly advanced semiconductors essential for AI development.\n\nMicrosoft, in a January blog, stated: \u201cGiven the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover\u2026 This fundamental lesson emerges from the past 20 years of telecommunications equipment exports.\n\nInitially, American and European companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, Ericsson, and Nokia built innovative products that defined international standards. But as Huawei invested in innovation and China\u2019s government subsidized sales of its products, especially across the developing world, adoption of these Chinese products outpaced the competition and became the backbone of numerous countries\u2019 telecommunications networks. This created the technology foundation for what later became an important issue for the Trump Administration in 2020, as it grappled with the presence of Huawei\u2019s 5G products and their implications for national and cybersecurity\u201d\n\nBeijing\u2019s 2015 Made in China strategy had already defined a goal of increasing chip self-reliance from 10% to 70% by 2025 (though that has already proven unrealistic). Later, the target was adjusted to 75% by 2030.\n\nNot long ago, it was thought that China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) would need seven years to catch up with today\u2019s western technology leaders. But SMIC and Huawei Technologies Co. have progressed quickly, using American technology to make advanced 7-nanometer chips in 2023.\n\nForeign players in the AI race pose a threat to the U.S. chip market including chipmaking leaders like Nvidia. The nearly $600 billion loss in Nvidia\u2019s market value in one single day over DeepSeek\u2019s launch is a reflection of those sentiments.\n\nDespite operating with seemingly fewer and less advanced chips, DeepSeek has managed to produce models that rival America\u2019s best, challenging Nvidia chip company\u2019s dominance in AI infrastructure. If DeepSeek\u2019s claims prove true, Nvidia\u2019s stranglehold on the AI hardware market could weaken, forcing a rethink in how AI scaling is approached.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act 2022, signed under the former Biden Administration is also facing criticism by Trump. According to a report by Council on Foreign Relations, a US-based think tank noted, \u201cAlthough the country [United States] produced close to 40 percent of the world\u2019s semiconductor supply in 1990, that statistic has slipped to just 12 percent.\u201d\n\nREAD: Apple eager to defend Google during antitrust trial (December 26, 2024)\n\nHowever, three days ago, Trump announced a $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TMSC) while China is also dependent on TMSC.\n\nAs Japan\u2019s most important ally, the U.S. also figures as a natural partner for the country in revitalizing its semiconductor industry which is booming now. This could benefit other countries like India and South Korea to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market for chips. Like other industries, the pandemic has shown how important it is to have a resilient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nWhile there is a fork in the road for both nations, if the U.S., the EU, Japan and other western countries want to avoid a complete decoupling, they might have to balance their economic security interests against overly protectionist policies or face higher costs and throttled innovation.",

The model learns through interaction with human or machine judges, continuously improving based on received rewards.\n\nThe researchers implemented the training process in two distinct phases. The first phase focused on scaling reinforcement learning for math and programming tasks using an accuracy checker and code execution server.\n\nIn the second phase, they added another reinforcement learning stage focused on general capabilities like following instructions, aligning with human preferences, and agent performance. Through these agent-related capabilities, QwQ-32B can think critically, use tools, and adjust its conclusions based on feedback from its environment.\n\nShare Recommend our article Share\n\nAlibaba has released QwQ-32B under the Apache 2.0 license as an open-weight model on Hugging Face and ModelScope. Users can access the model through Hugging Face Transformers, the Alibaba Cloud DashScope API, or test it directly through Qwen Chat.\n\nAlibaba has positioned QwQ-32B within its broader AI strategy alongside the Qwen2.5 series, which includes specialized models for language, programming, mathematics, and the large-context Qwen2.5-Turbo. The company has announced a 50 billion euro investment in AI development and cloud infrastructure in February. This initiative supports China's efforts to develop domestic processors for training large language models, reducing dependence on US companies like Nvidia.\n\nAd",

Analysts expect year-on-year rebounds in exports and imports in March due to the base effect and production returning to normal. But exports could begin to suffer as the impact of fresh tariffs from the Trump administration kick in.",

            "content": "On March 5, Chinese tech giant Alibaba released its latest AI reasoning model, QwQ-32B, resulting in an 8% spike in the company\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares. While less capable than America\u2019s leading AI systems, such as OpenAI\u2019s o3 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the model reportedly performs about as well as its Chinese competitor DeepSeek\u2019s model, R1, while requiring considerably less computing power to develop and to run. Its creators say QwQ-32B embodies an \u201cancient philosophical spirit\u201d by approaching problems with \u201cgenuine wonder and doubt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cIt reflects the broader competitiveness of China\u2019s frontier AI ecosystem,\u201d says Scott Singer, a visiting scholar in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That ecosystem includes DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and Tencent\u2019s Hunyuan model, which Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark has said is by some measures \u201cworld-class.\u201d That said, assessments of Alibaba\u2019s latest model are preliminary, both due to the inherent challenge of measuring model capabilities, and because so far, the model has only been assessed by Alibaba itself. \u201cThe information environment is not very rich right now,\u201d says Singer. Another step on the path to AGI Since the release of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model in January sent waves through the global stock market, China\u2019s tech ecosystem has been in the spotlight\u2014particularly as the U.S. increasingly sees itself as racing against China to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014highly advanced AI systems capable of performing most cognitive work, from graphic design to machine-learning research. AGI is widely expected to confer a decisive military and strategic advantage to whichever company or government creates it first, as such a system may be capable of engaging in advanced cyberwarfare or creating novel weapons of mass destruction (though experts are highly skeptical humans will be able to retain control over such a system, regardless of who creates it).\n\n\u201cWe are confident that combining stronger foundation models with reinforcement learning powered by scaled computational resources will propel us closer to achieving AGI,\u201d wrote the team behind Alibaba\u2019s latest model. The quest to create AGI permeates most leading AI labs. DeepSeek\u2019s stated goal is to \u201cunravel the mystery of AGI with curiosity.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s mission, meanwhile, is to \u201censure that artificial general intelligence\u2014AI systems that are generally smarter than humans\u2014benefits all of humanity.\u201d Leading AI CEOs including Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk all expect AGI-like systems to be built within President Trump\u2019s current term. Read More: How China Is Advancing in AI Despite U.S. Chip Restrictions China's turn Alibaba\u2019s latest AI release comes just two weeks after the company\u2019s co-founder, Jack Ma, was pictured in the front row at a meeting between President Xi Jinping and the country\u2019s preeminent business leaders. Since 2020, when Ma publicly criticized state regulators and state-owned banks for stifling innovation and operating with a \u201cpawn shop mentality,\u201d the Chinese billionaire has largely been absent from the public spotlight. In that time, the Chinese government cracked down on the tech industry, imposing stricter rules on how companies could use data and compete in the market, while also taking more control over key digital platforms.\n\nSinger says that by 2022, it became clear that the bigger threat to the country was not the tech industry, but economic stagnation. \u201cThat economic stagnation story, and attempting to reverse it, has really shaped so much of policy over the last 18 months,\u201d says Singer. China is moving quickly to adopt cutting-edge technology, with at least 13 city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies reportedly having already deployed DeepSeek models into their systems. Technical innovation Alibaba\u2019s model represents a continuation of existing trends: in recent years, AI systems have consistently increased in performance while becoming cheaper to run. Non-profit research organization Epoch AI estimates that the amount of computing power used to train AI systems has been increasing by more than 4x each year, while, thanks to regular improvements in algorithm design, that computing power is being used three times more efficiently each year. Put differently, a system that required, for example, 10,000 advanced computer chips to train last year could be trained with only a third as many this year.\n\nDespite efficiency improvements, Singer cautions that high-end computing chips remain crucial for advanced AI development\u2014a reality that makes U.S. export controls on these chips a continuing challenge for Chinese AI companies like Alibaba and DeepSeek, whose CEO has cited access to chips, rather than money or talent, as their biggest bottleneck. QwQ (pronounced like quill) is the latest to join a new generation of systems billed as \u201creasoning models,\u201d which some consider to represent a new paradigm in AI. Previously, AI systems got better by scaling both the amount of computing power used to train them and the amount and quality of data on which they were trained. In this new paradigm, the emphasis is on taking a model that has already been trained\u2014in this case, Qwen 2.5-32B\u2014and scaling the amount of computing the system uses in responding to a given query. As the Qwen team writes, \u201cwhen given time to ponder, to question, and to reflect, the model\u2019s understanding of mathematics and programming blossoms like a flower opening to the sun.\u201d This is consistent with trends observed with Western models, where techniques that allow them to \u201cthink\u201d longer have yielded significant improvements in performance on complex analytic problems.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s QwQ has been released \u201copen weight,\u201d meaning the weights that constitute the model\u2014accessible in the form of a computer file\u2014can be downloaded and run locally, including on a high-end laptop. Interestingly, a preview of the model, released last November, attracted considerably less attention. Singer notes that \u201cthe stock market is generally reactive to model releases and not to the trajectory of the technology,\u201d which is expected to continue to improve rapidly on both sides of the Pacific. \u201cThe Chinese ecosystem has a bunch of players in it, all of whom are putting out models that are very powerful and compelling, and it\u2019s not clear who will emerge, when it\u2019s all said and done, as having the best model,\u201d he says.",

            "content": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nChinese tech giant Alibaba unveiled its latest artificial intelligence reasoning model on Thursday, boasting that its capabilities beat those of rival models from OpenAI and startup DeepSeek.\n\nThe news prompted Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares to close 8% higher on the day and helped boost the Hang Seng\u2019s China Enterprises Index.\n\nThe release of Alibaba\u2019s new AI model comes a day after the launch of a \u201cgeneral AI agent\u201d called Manus by another company. A video on the website dedicated to Manus says the software can carry out complex, multi-step tasks such as screening resum\u00e9s and creating a website. According to Reuters, Manus is the creation of Chinese company Monica.\n\nThe video also says the AI agent is more advanced than a chatbot because it doesn\u2019t only generate ideas but delivers tangible results, such as producing a report recommending properties to buy based on specific criteria.\n\nAlibaba touted its new model, QwQ-32B, in an online statement as delivering \u201cexceptional performance, almost entirely surpassing OpenAI-o1-mini and rivaling the strongest open-source reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1.\u201d OpenAI-o1-mini is the American company\u2019s cost-efficient reasoning model released last year.\n\nAlibaba added the model has achieved a \u201cqualitative leap in mathematics, coding, and general capabilities, with overall performance on par with DeepSeek R1,\u201d it said in the statement.\n\nThe company claimed that its model has 32 billion parameters compared with DeepSeek\u2019s R1, which has 671 billion parameters. Fewer parameters imply a model is smaller and more efficient to train.\n\nDeepSeek stunned the world in January with its high-performing reasoning model R1 that it said cost far less to train than established Western rivals. Its success has shored up confidence among global investors in Chinese companies\u2019 ability to innovate at the time when the US-China tech rivalry intensifies. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has surged over 30% since January.\n\nAlibaba, the owner of Chinese e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, first launched its ChatGPT-equivalent service Tongyi Qianwen in 2023, after OpenAI launched its industry-defining AI reasoning model.\n\nIn January, Alibaba released another model, Qwen 2.5 Max, which it said surpassed the performance of DeepSeek\u2019s highly acclaimed V3 model, released just a few weeks before.\n\nLast week, Alibaba pledged to invest at least 380 billion yuan ($52.4 billion) in its AI and cloud computing infrastructure over the next three years. It said the amount exceeded what it had invested in those areas over the past decade.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese leaders pledged support for \u201cemerging industries and industries of the future,\u201d including increasing funding for artificial intelligence, humanoid robots and quantum technology.\n\nAnna Cooban in London contributed to this article.",

While DeepSeek\u2019s R1 demands 1600GB of VRAM to run its 671 billion parameters, QwQ 32B operates on just 24GB \u2014 a 98% reduction. Compared to OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini, Alibaba\u2019s AI model uses substantially lower computational requirements. It also demonstrated superior math problem-solving skills on the AIME24 benchmark, scoring 79.5, while OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini scored 63.6.\n\nThis breakthrough makes Alibaba a strong contender in the AI race, bringing a viable alternative to current industry leaders.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock soars 8% amid AI model launch\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock surged 8% following the positive market reception to the QwQ-32B AI model, which bolstered investor confidence in the company\u2019s growing influence in the AI industry. The model\u2019s success also contributed to a rise in the Hang Seng\u2019s China Enterprises Index, underscoring the impact of new AI advancements on the broader tech sector. This move strengthens Alibaba\u2019s position among leading AI companies, fueling anticipation for future developments.\n\nSmarter, leaner AI: A competitive advantage\n\nThe release of the Alibaba AI model could change how your business approaches artificial intelligence. Its ability to perform complex tasks with lower costs and resources makes AI more accessible and scalable than ever. Adopting such technologies could help your company stay competitive, without overextending your budget. Models like QwQ-32B could provide the flexibility and efficiency you need to thrive in your industry.",

The strength of the company's cloud Intelligence unit was a key contributor to Alibaba's sharp profit hike in the December quarter.\n\n\"Looking ahead, revenue growth at Cloud Intelligence Group driven by AI will continue to accelerate,\" Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said at the time.\n\nOptimism surrounding AI developments could lead to large gains for Alibaba stock and set the company's earnings \"on a more upwardly-pointing trajectory,\" Bernstein analysts said.\n\n\"The pace of innovation is incredibly fast right now. It's really good for the world to see this happening,\" Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday. \"When DeepSeek came out, it made everyone sort of question, was OpenAi the final answer? Would the incumbents, the Microsofts, the Googles, or the Amazons that have all made massive investments win?\"\n\nHe stressed that the large language models were increasingly \"becoming commoditized\" as developers look to drive down costs and improve access to users.\n\n\"As we see this more efficiency, this cost coming down, we're also going to see use going off. The training era, which is what Nvidia really built its initial AI boom off, was a big moment,\" Newman said. \"But the inference, the consumption of AI, is really the future and this is going to exponentially increase that volume.\"",

            "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nQwen Team \u2014 a division of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba developing its growing family of open-source Qwen large language models (LLMs) \u2014 has introduced QwQ-32B, a new 32-billion-parameter reasoning model designed to improve performance on complex problem-solving tasks through reinforcement learning (RL).\n\nThe model is available as open-weight on Hugging Face and on ModelScope under an Apache 2.0 license. This means it\u2019s available for commercial and research uses, so enterprises can employ it immediately to power their products and applications (even ones they charge customers to use).\n\nIt can also be accessed for individual users via Qwen Chat.\n\nQwen-with-Questions was Alibaba\u2019s answer to OpenAI\u2019s original reasoning model o1\n\nQwQ, short for Qwen-with-Questions, was first introduced by Alibaba in November 2024 as an open-source reasoning model aimed at competing with OpenAI\u2019s o1-preview.\n\nAt launch, the model was designed to enhance logical reasoning and planning by reviewing and refining its own responses during inference, a technique that made it particularly effective in math and coding tasks.\n\nThe initial version of QwQ released back in November 2024 (called simply, \u201cQwQ\u201d) featured 32 billion parameters as well, and a 32,000-token context length. Alibaba highlighted its ability to outperform o1-preview in mathematical benchmarks like AIME and MATH, as well as scientific reasoning tasks such as GPQA.\n\nDespite its strengths, QwQ\u2019s early iterations struggled with programming benchmarks like LiveCodeBench, where OpenAI\u2019s models maintained an edge. Additionally, as with many emerging reasoning models, QwQ faced challenges such as language mixing and occasional circular reasoning loops.\n\nHowever, Alibaba\u2019s decision to release the model under an Apache 2.0 license ensured that developers and enterprises could freely adapt and commercialize it, distinguishing it from proprietary alternatives like OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nSince QwQ\u2019s initial release, the AI landscape has evolved rapidly. The limitations of traditional LLMs have become more apparent, with scaling laws yielding diminishing returns in performance improvements.\n\nThis shift has fueled interest in large reasoning models (LRMs) \u2014 a new category of AI systems that use inference-time reasoning and self-reflection to enhance accuracy. These include OpenAI\u2019s o3 series and the massively successful DeepSeek-R1 from rival Chinese lab DeepSeek, an offshoot of Hong Kong quantitative analysis firm High-Flyer Capital Management.\n\nA new report from web traffic analytics and research firm SimilarWeb found that since the launch of R1 back in January 2024, DeepSeek has rocketed up the charts to become the most-visited AI model-providing website behind OpenAI.\n\nCredit: SimilarWeb, AI Global Global Sector Trends on Generative AI\n\nQwQ-32B, Alibaba\u2019s latest iteration, builds on these advancements by integrating RL and structured self-questioning, positioning it as a serious competitor in the growing field of reasoning-focused AI.\n\nThe context length of the new model has been extended to 131,000 tokens, as well \u2014 similar to the 128,000 of OpenAI\u2019s models and many others, though Google Gemini 2.0\u2019s context remains superior at 2 million tokens. (Recall context refers to the number of tokens that the LLM can input/output in a single interaction, with higher token count meaning more information. 131,000 tokens is equivalent to around a 300-page book.\n\nScaling up performance with multi-stage reinforcement learning\n\nTraditional instruction-tuned models often struggle with difficult reasoning tasks, but the Qwen Team\u2019s research suggests that RL can significantly improve a model\u2019s ability to solve complex problems.\n\nQwQ-32B builds on this idea by implementing a multi-stage RL training approach to enhance mathematical reasoning, coding proficiency and general problem-solving.\n\nThe model has been benchmarked against leading alternatives such as DeepSeek-R1, o1-mini and DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-32B, demonstrating competitive results despite having fewer parameters than some of these models.\n\nFor example, while DeepSeek-R1 operates with 671 billion parameters (with 37 billion activated), QwQ-32B achieves comparable performance with a much smaller footprint \u2014 typically requiring 24 GB of vRAM on a GPU (Nvidia\u2019s H100s have 80GB) compared to more than 1500 GB of vRAM for running the full DeepSeek R1 (16 Nvidia A100 GPUs) \u2014 highlighting the efficiency of Qwen\u2019s RL approach.\n\nQwQ-32B follows a causal language model architecture and includes several optimizations:\n\n64 transformer layers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm and Attention QKV bias;\n\nGeneralized query attention (GQA) with 40 attention heads for queries and 8 for key-value pairs;\n\nExtended context length of 131,072 tokens, allowing for better handling of long-sequence inputs;\n\nMulti-stage training including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning and RL.\n\nThe RL process for QwQ-32B was executed in two phases:\n\nMath and coding focus: The model was trained using an accuracy verifier for mathematical reasoning and a code execution server for coding tasks. This approach ensured that generated answers were validated for correctness before being reinforced. General capability enhancement: In a second phase, the model received reward-based training using general reward models and rule-based verifiers. This stage improved instruction following, human alignment and agent reasoning without compromising its math and coding capabilities.\n\nWhat it means for enterprise decision-makers\n\nFor enterprise leaders\u2014including CEOs, CTOs, IT leaders, team managers and AI application developers\u2014QwQ-32B represents a potential shift in how AI can support business decision-making and technical innovation.\n\nWith its RL-driven reasoning capabilities, the model can provide more accurate, structured and context-aware insights, making it valuable for use cases such as automated data analysis, strategic planning, software development and intelligent automation.\n\nCompanies looking to deploy AI solutions for complex problem-solving, coding assistance, financial modeling or customer service automation may find QwQ-32B\u2019s efficiency an attractive option. Additionally, its open-weight availability allows organizations to fine-tune and customize the model for domain-specific applications without proprietary restrictions, making it a flexible choice for enterprise AI strategies.\n\nThe fact that it comes from a Chinese e-commerce giant may raise some security and bias concerns for some non-Chinese users, especially when using the Qwen Chat interface. But as with DeepSeek-R1, the fact that the model is available on Hugging Face for download and offline usage and fine-tuning or retraining suggests that these can be overcome fairly easily. And it is a viable alternative to DeepSeek-R1.\n\nEarly reactions from AI power users and influencers\n\nThe release of QwQ-32B has already gained attention from the AI research and development community, with several developers and industry professionals sharing their initial impressions on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nHugging Face\u2019s Vaibhav Srivastav (@reach_vb) highlighted QwQ-32B\u2019s speed in inference thanks to provider Hyperbolic Labs, calling it \u201cblazingly fast\u201d and comparable to top-tier models. He also noted that the model \u201cbeats DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-mini with Apache 2.0 license.\u201d\n\nAI news and rumor publisher Chubby (@kimmonismus) was impressed by the model\u2019s performance, emphasizing that QwQ-32B sometimes outperforms DeepSeek-R1, despite being 20 times smaller. \u201cHoly moly! Qwen cooked!\u201d they wrote.\n\nYuchen Jin (@Yuchenj_UW), co-founder and CTO of Hyperbolic Labs , celebrated the release by noting the efficiency gains. \u201cSmall models are so powerful! Alibaba Qwen released QwQ-32B, a reasoning model that beats DeepSeek-R1 (671B) and OpenAI o1-mini!\u201d\n\ncelebrated the release by noting the efficiency gains. \u201cSmall models are so powerful! Alibaba Qwen released QwQ-32B, a reasoning model that beats DeepSeek-R1 (671B) and OpenAI o1-mini!\u201d Another Hugging Face team member, Erik Kaunism\u00e4ki (@ErikKaum) emphasized the ease of deployment, sharing that the model is available for one-click deployment on Hugging Face endpoints, making it accessible to developers without extensive setup.\n\nAgentic capabilities\n\nQwQ-32B incorporates agentic capabilities, allowing it to dynamically adjust reasoning processes based on environmental feedback.\n\nFor optimal performance, Qwen Team recommends using the following inference settings:\n\nTemperature : 0.6\n\n: 0.6 TopP : 0.95\n\n: 0.95 TopK : Between 20-40\n\n: Between 20-40 YaRN Scaling: Recommended for handling sequences longer than 32,768 tokens\n\nThe model supports deployment using vLLM, a high-throughput inference framework. However, current implementations of vLLM only support static YaRN scaling, which maintains a fixed scaling factor regardless of input length.\n\nFuture developments\n\nQwen\u2019s team sees QwQ-32B as the first step in scaling RL to enhance reasoning capabilities. Looking ahead, the team plans to:\n\nFurther explore scaling RL to improve model intelligence;\n\nIntegrate agents with RL for long-horizon reasoning;\n\nContinue developing foundation models optimized for RL;\n\nMove toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) through more advanced training techniques.\n\nWith QwQ-32B, Qwen Team is positioning RL as a key driver of the next generation of AI models, demonstrating that scaling can produce highly performant and effective reasoning systems.",

            "content": "The prospect of additional support from China's government helped fuel a tech rally.\n\nStocks of several of China's most popular technology companies were rallying on Wednesday as the country's leader promised to support the technology industry and kept its economic growth goals intact.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, some of China's favorite stocks outpaced the gains of the broader market. Shares of Alibaba (BABA -1.35%) surged 7.7%, JD.com (JD -0.93%) climbed 5.7%, and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY -1.00%) rose 5.3% as of 12:50 p.m. ET. There wasn't any company-specific news fueling the gains, which suggests the comments made by the country's leader helped drive the stocks higher.\n\nNational People's Congress gets underway\n\nThe National People's Congress is China's week-long political event and one of the government's most important annual gatherings. To kick off the meeting, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced support for the country's most important emerging industries, particularly in the technology space. \"We will establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries of the future and foster industries such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied artificial intelligence (AI), and 6G technology,\" he said.\n\nThis show of support was something of a surprise to market watchers and sparked a broad-based rally among China's most widely followed technology stocks. The MSCI China Index, which represents some of the country's most well-known large-cap and mid-cap stocks, jumped 2.7% on the news, helping to stoke investor sentiment. This added to the index's robust performance so far this year, as it has gained 21% since its January low.\n\nAdditionally, China kept its economic growth target of 5% intact despite the Trump administration's tariffs and the increasing concerns of a protracted trade war. China's willingness to stand by its projections was taken by market watchers to suggest the country is planning to provide additional economic stimulus, particularly to support ongoing developments in AI and quantum computing.\n\nChinese AI start-up DeepSeek made headlines in late January with the release of its R1 reasoning model, which it claimed could go head-to-head with OpenAI's o1 model at a fraction of the cost. Many experts have since questioned claims that DeepSeek's model cost just $5.6 million to develop, with recent estimates suggesting it was closer to $1.6 billion.\n\nThe advancements were impressive, nonetheless. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the model was \"an excellent innovation\" and went so far as to describe it as \"a world-class reasoning AI model.\"\n\nWhy it matters\n\nSo, what does all this mean for our trio of Chinese tech stocks? Plenty, as it turns out.\n\nThese companies are widely regarded as AI darlings in China. Alibaba's stock has surged 73% since its low in mid-January (as of this writing). JD and Tencent have also been firmly in rally mode, with the stocks up 41% and 30%, respectively, during the same timeframe. Recent developments suggest there could be more to come.\n\nReports emerged that Alibaba is working with Apple to roll out AI features in China.\n\nto roll out AI features in China. JD announced a host of AI-powered enhancements to its JD Cloud offering while providing its cloud customers with free access to many of China's most popular large language models to create their own AI systems.\n\nTencent recently released a new AI model that it says rivals DeepSeek's R1 in performance while providing faster response times.\n\nHeading into this year, China's AI tech leaders had lagged many of their U.S.-based counterparts, with Tencent, JD, and Alibaba gaining 41%, 20%, and 9%, respectively, in 2024. However, Beijing signaling support for China's home-grown AI efforts gave investors confidence that this year's tech rally has only just begun.\n\nThese stocks are currently selling at compelling valuations. Even after the recent rally, Tencent, Alibaba, and JD.com are selling for 16 times, 12 times, and 11 times trailing-12-month earnings, respectively -- which are reasonable multiples given their potential for future growth, particularly since they appear to have the backing of the Chinese government.\n\nChinese stocks tend to be a bit riskier, but for investors with the appropriate long-term outlook and an interest in investing in China, now might be a good time to pick up shares of these stocks before they run higher.",

The stock also jumped on news that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was meeting with the country's tech moguls.\n\nThe share performance is part of a DeepSeek-propelled stock rally for Chinese tech firms, which are making a comeback after Beijing's yearslong crackdown on Big Tech. Investors saw Xi's meeting with tech leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Tencent CEO Pony Ma, and electric vehicle maker BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu, as a sign he wants to revive the sector.\n\nEarly last week, Alibaba announced plans to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. How much Big Tech companies are spending \u2014 part of their capital expenditure \u2014 is a hot topic, as some companies double down on AI-related investments.\n\n\"DeepSeek is driving Cloud capex in China,\" HSBC analyst Frank He wrote in a note last week. \"We see that individual user demand has been growing, and the AI model has been increasingly deployed by enterprises and government entities.\"\n\nLast month, Goldman Sachs analysts said that DeepSeek R-1 has \"altered the narrative\" of China tech. They added that the recent rally appears to be more sustainable compared to a September stimulus-driven spike that fizzled out in weeks because it is \"innovation-driven.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Alibaba said its QwQ-32B model has one-fifth of the parameters compared to DeepSeek-R1, which means it is highly efficient. The model is now open-source on platforms including Hugging Face. Open-source models allow for the free and open sharing of software to anyone for any purpose.\n\nDeepSeek launched an open-sourced AI model in January, rattling US tech and AI companies . Third-party tests showed the model outperformed its peers from OpenAI, Meta, and other top developers, and the company said it was built for less money.\n\nThe company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

            "content": "The permissively licensed RISC-V instruction set architecture appears to be gaining significant momentum in China.\n\nOne sign of enthusiasm for the royalty-free ISA came late last week when an outfit named XuanTie, which is part of Alibaba\u2019s DAMO Academy R&D operation, announced a C930 CPU design that's available to license for system-on-chip makers. The CPU core is pitched as the ideal brains for servers, PCs, and autonomous cars.\n\nXuanTie, which shares some of its RISC-V CPU cores as open source, said its C930 can be used to build \u201ca 64-bit high-performance multi-core processor that uses a superscalar, out-of-order execution, 6-decode width, and 16-stage pipeline microarchitecture.\u201d The core is apparently compatible with the RISC-V RVA23 profile family, and supports ISA extensions such as Vector, Crypto, Zacas, Zama16b, Smmtt, CoVE, RAS, AIA, and Zalasr.\n\nRVA23 compatibility matters because it\u2019s a cornerstone of the RISC-V ecosystem, ratified last year, and among other things specifies hypervisor extensions that are all-but-essential for a processor intended for deployment in servers, clouds, or other large-scale scenarios where the ability to run virtual machines is table stakes. By being RVA23 ready, the C930 meets a baseline expected of modern RISC-V systems.\n\nMachine translation of XuanTie\u2019s product blurb produces the following description: \u201cC930 uses advanced micro-architecture technology to achieve high performance, including TAGE-based branch prediction algorithm, Private L2 Cache, adjustable data prefetch mechanism, etc. C930 Specint2006 performance score exceeds 15/GHz.\u201d\n\nWe're told \"a typical single cluster configuration supports four cores,\u201d meaning you can't go licensing the C930 for a quad-core processor, and that a 64KB instruction cache, 64KB data cache, and 1MB L2 cache are all \u201ctypical\u201d and configurable.\n\nThe included vector unit supports the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension, handles 256-bit vector registers, and supports FP16/BF16/FP32/FP64/INT8/INT16/INT32/INT64.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at a diagram depicting the architecture of a C930-based system-on-chip...\n\nXuanTie's C930 processor diagram ... Click to enlarge\n\nChinese media report that at the conference where the XuanTie C930 was launched, senior Alibaba Cloud execs predicted RISC-V will become a mainstream cloud architecture in five to eight years.\n\nXi we go, Xi we go\n\nAccording to a Tuesday report from Reuters, Beijing is close to releasing a policy that that could make that prediction real.\n\nThe newswire reported that eight Chinese government bodies are working on \u201cguidance\u201d that will encourage widespread use of RISC-V throughout China.\n\nSuch guidance would be consistent China\u2019s 2024 call for local orgs to stop buying American silicon and shop locally instead.\n\nAfter that suggestion, Chinese chipmaker Loongson scored a ten thousand-PC pilot in Chinese schools, and a place on China\u2019s space station. Lenovo backed Loongson by porting its hyperconverged infrastructure stack to the company\u2019s distinctive processor architecture.\n\nGiant telco China Mobile advised its future server procurement plans would require some machines using processors that employ the C86 architecture, a Chinese x86 variant.\n\nA new edict from Beijing could perhaps accelerate similar purchasing plans.\n\nChinese orgs have already expressed strong interest in RISC-V without notable results.\n\nIn 2021, China\u2019s Academy of Sciences promised to release new RISC-V designs every six months. While it didn\u2019t meet that target, in February 2025 the Academy teased a potentially powerful RISC-V design.\n\nMiddle Kingdom search giant Baidu explored datacenter-grade RISC-V chips in 2023. In the same year, Alibaba expressed a desire to create RISC-V chips capable of powering everything from wearable devices to clouds.\n\nResults of those efforts are not yet obvious, and we\u2019ve never heard of a Chinese RISC-V processor delivering eye-catching performance, as was the case last year when Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Yitian 710 CPU was rated the fastest Arm chip available in any hyperscale cloud.\n\nAlibaba achieved that result just a few years after starting work on its own designs. Perhaps it could do the same with RISC-V, although the company will need to improve on its past efforts that in August 2024 were found to have serious security flaws.\n\nChina\u2019s RISC-V efforts are taking place as the USA leads efforts to prevent the transfer of advanced tech to the Middle Kingdom, largely on national security grounds.\n\nUS lawmakers are already worried that RISC-V\u2019s license, which allows developers to use the architecture for free, means Chinese firms can use IP created in America to develop advanced tech. \u00ae",

Meanwhile, Ives kept his price target steady at $325, predicting an upside of 36.54% from the current trading levels. Year-to-date, AAPL stock is down nearly 5%, despite having risen 36% over the past 12 months.\n\nIn context, Apple announced its partnership with Alibaba in early February, aiming to integrate Chinese tech giant\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence) model, Qwen 2.5, into iPhones sold in China.\n\nIves Sees Growth Potential for Apple in China\n\nIves believes Apple\u2019s AI rollout has faced a major hurdle due to the absence of an approved strategy for China. Nonetheless, he stated that now Apple has finally secured its China AI partner with Alibaba partnership and expects this to boost iPhone sales starting in the June quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Ives estimates that around 100 million iPhones in China are due for an upgrade, creating a major growth opportunity for Apple. While the company has lost market share to Huawei over the past year, Wedbush expects Apple\u2019s AI-powered features in the upcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 (set for a September launch) to help Apple regain its position in the market.\n\nOverall, he highlighted that Apple\u2019s collaboration with Alibaba will play a crucial role in its expansion in China, especially in advancing its AI initiatives. In the long run, Wedbush expects 25% of the global population to access AI via an Apple device in the coming years.\n\nIs Apple Stock Price a Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AAPL stock based on 18 Buys, 11 Holds, and four Sells assigned in the last three months. The average Apple share price target of $250.48 implies a 5.23% upside potential.\n\nSee more AAPL analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "The permissively licensed RISC-V instruction set architecture appears to be gaining significant momentum in China.\n\nOne sign of enthusiasm for the royalty-free ISA came late last week when an outfit named XuanTie, which is part of Alibaba\u2019s DAMO Academy R&D operation, announced a C930 CPU design that's available to license for system-on-chip makers. The CPU core is pitched as the ideal brains for servers, PCs, and autonomous cars.\n\nXuanTie, which shares some of its RISC-V CPU cores as open source, said its C930 can be used to build \u201ca 64-bit high-performance multi-core processor that uses a superscalar, out-of-order execution, 6-decode width, and 16-stage pipeline microarchitecture.\u201d The core is apparently compatible with the RISC-V RVA23 profile family, and supports ISA extensions such as Vector, Crypto, Zacas, Zama16b, Smmtt, CoVE, RAS, AIA, and Zalasr.\n\nRVA23 compatibility matters because it\u2019s a cornerstone of the RISC-V ecosystem, ratified last year, and among other things specifies hypervisor extensions that are all-but-essential for a processor intended for deployment in servers, clouds, or other large-scale scenarios where the ability to run virtual machines is table stakes. By being RVA23 ready, the C930 meets a baseline expected of modern RISC-V systems.\n\nMachine translation of XuanTie\u2019s product blurb produces the following description: \u201cC930 uses advanced micro-architecture technology to achieve high performance, including TAGE-based branch prediction algorithm, Private L2 Cache, adjustable data prefetch mechanism, etc. C930 Specint2006 performance score exceeds 15/GHz.\u201d\n\nWe're told \"a typical single cluster configuration supports four cores,\u201d meaning you can't go licensing the C930 for a quad-core processor, and that a 64KB instruction cache, 64KB data cache, and 1MB L2 cache are all \u201ctypical\u201d and configurable.\n\nThe included vector unit supports the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension, handles 256-bit vector registers, and supports FP16/BF16/FP32/FP64/INT8/INT16/INT32/INT64.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at a diagram depicting the architecture of a C930-based system-on-chip...\n\nXuanTie's C930 processor diagram ... Click to enlarge\n\nChinese media report that at the conference where the XuanTie C930 was launched, senior Alibaba Cloud execs predicted RISC-V will become a mainstream cloud architecture in five to eight years.\n\nXi we go, Xi we go\n\nAccording to a Tuesday report from Reuters, Beijing is close to releasing a policy that that could make that prediction real.\n\nThe newswire reported that eight Chinese government bodies are working on \u201cguidance\u201d that will encourage widespread use of RISC-V throughout China.\n\nSuch guidance would be consistent China\u2019s 2024 call for local orgs to stop buying American silicon and shop locally instead.\n\nAfter that suggestion, Chinese chipmaker Loongson scored a ten thousand-PC pilot in Chinese schools, and a place on China\u2019s space station. Lenovo backed Loongson by porting its hyperconverged infrastructure stack to the company\u2019s distinctive processor architecture.\n\nGiant telco China Mobile advised its future server procurement plans would require some machines using processors that employ the C86 architecture, a Chinese x86 variant.\n\nA new edict from Beijing could perhaps accelerate similar purchasing plans.\n\nChinese orgs have already expressed strong interest in RISC-V without notable results.\n\nIn 2021, China\u2019s Academy of Sciences promised to release new RISC-V designs every six months. While it didn\u2019t meet that target, in February 2025 the Academy teased a potentially powerful RISC-V design.\n\nMiddle Kingdom search giant Baidu explored datacenter-grade RISC-V chips in 2023. In the same year, Alibaba expressed a desire to create RISC-V chips capable of powering everything from wearable devices to clouds.\n\nResults of those efforts are not yet obvious, and we\u2019ve never heard of a Chinese RISC-V processor delivering eye-catching performance, as was the case last year when Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Yitian 710 CPU was rated the fastest Arm chip available in any hyperscale cloud.\n\nAlibaba achieved that result just a few years after starting work on its own designs. Perhaps it could do the same with RISC-V, although the company will need to improve on its past efforts that in August 2024 were found to have serious security flaws.\n\nChina\u2019s RISC-V efforts are taking place as the USA leads efforts to prevent the transfer of advanced tech to the Middle Kingdom, largely on national security grounds.\n\nUS lawmakers are already worried that RISC-V\u2019s license, which allows developers to use the architecture for free, means Chinese firms can use IP created in America to develop advanced tech. \u00ae",

            "content": "Jack Ma (born September 10, 1964, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China) is a Chinese entrepreneur who was head of the Alibaba Group, which comprised several of China\u2019s most popular websites, including the business-to-business marketplace Alibaba.com and the shopping site Taobao.com.\n\nMa became interested in the English language as a young boy, and during his teens he worked as a guide for foreign tourists to Hangzhou. Ma failed the entrance exam for the Hangzhou Teachers College twice. (His weak point was mathematics.) He was admitted on his third try, in 1984, and he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English in 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he taught English at the Hangzhou Institute of Electronics and Engineering (now Hangzhou Dianzi University). In 1994 he founded his first company, the Haibo Translation Agency, which provided English translation and interpretation.\n\nOn a trip to the United States on behalf of the Hangzhou city government in 1995, Ma had his first encounter with the Internet and saw the lack of Chinese websites as a great business opportunity. On his return, he founded China Pages, which created Web pages for Chinese businesses and was one of China\u2019s first Internet companies. He left the company two years later, however, partly because of strong competition from the communications company Hangzhou Telecom, which had founded a rival company, Chinesepage. From 1998 to 1999 Ma was head of an Internet company in Beijing that was backed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. He felt, however, that if he remained with the government, he would miss out on the economic opportunities brought about by the Internet revolution. Ma persuaded his team at the ministry to go back to Hangzhou with him and found the Alibaba Group, which took the form of a website that facilitated deals between small businesses.\n\nMa was convinced that the small-business-to-small-business Internet market had much greater potential for growth than the alternative business-to-consumer Internet market. Small businesses paid a membership fee to be certified as trustworthy sellers on Alibaba, with a greater fee charged to businesses that wished to sell to customers outside of China. In order to instill confidence in online sales, Alipay was created (2003) to act as a third party in transactions. Alibaba grew quickly and was noticed by larger international companies such as the American company eBay, which offered to purchase Alibaba multiple times starting in 2004. In 2005 it attracted the attention of the American Internet portal Yahoo!, which bought a 40 percent stake, and in 2007 Alibaba.com raised $1.7 billion dollars in its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2003 Ma created a new company, the consumer-to-consumer online marketplace Taobao (Chinese: \u201csearching for treasure\u201d). At the time, eBay, in collaboration with the Chinese company EachNet, had a market share of 80 percent, but Ma felt that eBay-EachNet\u2019s policy of charging users a transaction fee was a weakness. Taobao did not charge such a fee but made money from online advertising and by selling additional services to users. Ma\u2019s intuition proved correct; by 2007 Taobao had a 67 percent market share, and eBay conceded majority ownership of its Chinese operations to the Chinese-language media company TOM Group, which created the subsidiary TOM EachNet.\n\nIn 2011 Ma announced that Taobao would split into three companies: Taobao Marketplace, where individuals could buy and sell goods; Taobao Mall, an online shopping portal; and eTao, a shopping-related search engine. In September 2014 the Alibaba Group debuted an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange that raised $21.8 billion. That IPO was the largest ever in the United States and gave the company a market value of $168 billion, the highest such value in IPO history at that time for any Internet company. In September 2018 it was announced that Ma would step down as chair of Alibaba the following year, though he would remain on the board.\n\nIn 2014 Ma oversaw the creation of the Ant Group, which served as the parent group of Alipay and other financial services. In 2020 Ant was scheduled for an IPO. However, that was delayed when Chinese officials demanded that the company be restructured. In addition, an antitrust investigation was opened against Alibaba. These developments came shortly after Ma criticized the country\u2019s financial regulators. In April 2021 Alibaba was charged with a $2.8 billion antitrust fine for violating anti-monopoly laws. The fine was minor compared with the company\u2019s vast earnings.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

            "content": "Alibaba announced its newest CPU release this week with the XuanTie C930. The new RISC-V processor is built for AI-HPC workloads, and Alibaba describes it as its 'first server-grade processor' in an article published by the South China Morning Post.\n\nDamo Academy, Alibaba's research and development institute, announced the XuanTie C930 at a conference in Beijing on Friday. Alibaba first teased the C930 last year when the company confirmed a 2024 release for the server chip. Now, a year after its first teasers, the C930 is here to herald a new era of Alibaba's RISC-V production.\n\nWe still don't know much about the C930, despite this announcement. No core counts, clock speeds, or cache sizes were shared in Alibaba's SCMP article. No performance numbers or claims about the C930 have been found either, at least looking in from the Western internet. Some Chinese publications have touted a performance claim of 15 points per GHz in the legacy SPECint2006 benchmark, but these numbers have been tied to rumors around the chip since March of last year.\n\nHowever, it should be said that Alibaba does have a solid reputation for CPU performance; the company's Yitian 710 was found to be the fastest Arm-based CPU for cloud servers last year, with the 128-core chip even beating out Intel's 48-core Xeon Platinum 8488C in some efficiency benchmarks. Based on its pedigree, it would not be surprising for the C930 to end up performing beyond expectations, though we may never get our hands on the chip to see for ourselves.\n\nDamo Academy also announced a plan for more new RISC-V chips to follow the C930 under the XuanTie badge: the C908X, R908A, and XL200. These will be intended for AI acceleration, automotive use, and high-speed connectivity, respectively. News of these new chips arrived immediately following Alibaba's announcement of its \u00a5380 billion ($52 billion) investment plan in AI and cloud infrastructure over the next three years.\n\nAlibaba has done much to push the RISC-V CPU market forward since entering the scene in 2019. Damo Academy claimed that its CPU team \"has supported the implementation of more than 30 percent of RISC-V high-performance processors\" at the C930 launch.\n\nRISC-V adoption is one of the only paths for Chinese companies to push forward their CPU innovation, thanks to intense U.S. export laws blocking the nation from access to more established ISAs. With a new administration in the White House that seems even more bullish on the U.S.-China Chip War, Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies will likely continue innovating on RISC-V. Due to RISC-V being an open-source architecture held by a non-American foundation, it is safe from U.S. trade intervention (for now).",

It appears the day has finally come with Alibaba (BABA) emerging as the clear tech partner and \u201cwinner\u201d for Apple Intelligence in the key China region that should be a launching pad for iPhone positive growth to return to the story for Apple starting in the June quarter, the firm says. While there are still some small issues to be resolved, after traveling extensively throughout Asia and speaking to many in the supply chain the last few weeks, Wedbush believes there is growing confidence inside and outside China this AI launch will be in the June quarter for Apple.\n\nThis Alibaba partnership is key to the long-awaited growth catalyst in this region with our estimates that over 100 million of the roughly 200 million iPhones in China are in the window of an upgrade opportunity, it adds. The firm continues to view this first launch of Apple Intelligence as just the beginning of a broader AI strategy for Apple as it estimates roughly 25% of the world\u2019s population will eventually access AI through an Apple device over the next few years. Wedbush has an Outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $325.\n\nNVIDIA CHIPS: Servers used in a fraud case Singapore announced last week were supplied by U.S. firms and may have contained Nvidia (NVDA) advanced chips, Bing Hong Lok of Reuters reports. Three men were charged with fraud last week in Singapore and domestic media linked the case to the transfer for Nvidia AI chips to DeepSeek.\n\nMANUFACTURING TESTS: Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are running 18A manufacturing tests with Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) is also evaluating whether Intel\u2019s 18A process is suitable for its needs, Reuters\u2019 Max A. Cherney and Fanny Potkin report. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the tests indicate the companies are moving closer to determining whether they will commit hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of manufacturing contracts to Intel.\n\nAI AGENTS: ServiceNow (NOW) announced the introduction of AI agents for the telecom industry. The AI agents were built with Nvidia AI Enterprise software and the AI platform, Nvidia DGX Cloud. The agents are designed to drive productivity across the entire service lifecycle. The first use cases will put AI agents to work for communications service providers to autonomously solve some of the most common, labor-intensive workflows in customer service and network operations.\n\nGENERATIVE AI BENEFITS: Monness Crespi upgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Neutral from Sell without a price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report next week. Oracle \u201crepresents a high-quality company\u201d with the opportunity to participate in a cloud transformation and benefit from the generative artificial intelligence trend, the analyst tells investors in a research note. However, the firm believes the stock\u2019s valuation \u201cis stretched,\u201d Oracle\u2019s capex spending is unsustainable, its competition is fierce, and the macro environment is \u201cfragile.\u201d\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

            "content": "The tech giant's turnaround effort is gaining momentum.\n\nAlibaba's (BABA -1.35%) stock has been on fire lately. The Chinese tech giant reported a commendable result for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024, with revenue growing by 8% and income from operations surging by 83%.\n\nInvestors cheered the results, sending the stock up by around 15% after the announcement. But digging further into Alibaba's results indicates much more than the headline numbers, suggesting that Alibaba's turnaround effort is finally bearing fruit.\n\nAlibaba was facing a series of challenges\n\nThe last few years have been the most challenging period for Alibaba. It has experienced a series of issues, which included the cancellation of Ant Group's initial public offering, regulatory crackdowns on the tech sector in China, and a challenging operating environment post-COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThese challenges affected its financial performance, leading to muted/negative growth in its flagship e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. To put it into perspective, e-commerce and cloud computing revenue grew at 34% and 62%, respectively, for its fiscal 2020, which ended March 31, 2020. However, in fiscal 2024, revenue rose by just 5% and 3%, respectively.\n\nInvestors were concerned that the tech giant had passed its prime, and slow to no growth could be the new normal for it. It didn't help that the company made one of its biggest restructurings during this period, which resulted in a complete overhaul of the senior leadership team. The change in management team added another layer of uncertainty to the dire situation.\n\nThe e-commerce business has been making good progress lately\n\nOnce the undisputed leader in the Chinese e-commerce sector, Alibaba's dominance is now in question as it faces competition from younger rivals like Pinduoduo and Douying. The former targets cost-conscious consumers, while the latter attracts live-streaming shoppers.\n\nIn response, Alibaba has made some bold moves, including shifting its focus from merchant-centered to consumer-centered, improving price competitiveness, and doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI) to improve user experience. In particular, Alibaba's focus is on enabling customers of different levels of spending power to find the best products at affordable prices on its platforms.\n\nWhile it's still in its early days, Alibaba's latest financials demonstrate that its strategy is paying off. For instance, the e-commerce company's customer management revenue grew by 9% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024, driven by growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) and take-rate. This demonstrates that consumers are spending more on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms, and merchants are spending more on marketing fees.\n\nBeyond its home turf, Alibaba is expanding its international e-commerce businesses to diversify away from its reliance on its home market. This segment has been growing rapidly lately, with revenue up by 32% year over year in the latest quarter. In other words, Alibaba is making solid strides in rejuvenating the growth of its e-commerce businesses.\n\nThe cloud computing business is growing again\n\nAs the undisputed leader in China's cloud computing industry with a 39% market share, Alibaba Cloud once held the biggest responsibility in sustaining Alibaba's high growth trajectory. However, a few years of slow growth almost shattered investors' hopes altogether. Weak enterprise demand due to challenging economic conditions, competition, and the cancellation of Alibaba Cloud's IPO spin-off are some of the issues that the business has faced.\n\nFortunately, with the new CEO at the helm, Alibaba Cloud is gradually gaining momentum, evident in its accelerating revenue growth rate of 13% year over year in the latest quarter. In particular, AI-related revenue grew at triple-digit rates for six consecutive quarters. It also launched its latest large language model, Qwen 2.5, which is among the most advanced models globally.\n\nAlibaba Cloud's recent performance indicates a few things. First, the cloud computing business is gaining momentum, and its growth rates could improve further in the coming quarters. Second, the new leadership team has made some great decisions, such as going all-in into AI, setting the business in the right direction for the future.\n\nBesides, Alibaba Cloud is doubling down on investment in AI infrastructure, with expected investments in the next three years to exceed what it has spent over the past decade. It will also invest heavily in developing AI foundation models and AI-native applications. These moves suggest that cloud computing could have a multi-year growth cycle ahead.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nAlibaba's recent quarterly report is a breath of fresh air, suggesting that the tech giant has finally found its new direction. Investors should monitor Alibaba's performance in the coming quarters. If the e-commerce and cloud computing businesses can sustain their recent trajectory, investors can be confident that the worst could be over for Alibaba.\n\nAll eyes are on the company's performance in the next few quarters.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAI-darling Nvidia reported its earnings yesterday, and it\u2019s safe to say that the numbers have been objectively great. Nevertheless, investor sentiment remains rather mixed, implying a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d case.\n\nMost of these concerns remain about sustaining the AI-driven market rally. The emergence of less power-hungry rivals such as DeepSeek also suggests uncertainty regarding the future demand for advanced chips.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now\n\nAlongside, President Donald Trump noted that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico are set to go into effect on March 4, adding that an additional 10% tax would be imposed on Chinese imports.\n\nInvestment firm UBS, without commenting on individual names, said that the earnings print reinforces their view that the broader AI market is big enough for every segment to grow, and that they remain positive on the AI compute industry as well as the broader AI trend. This is despite recent concerns around low-cost models like DeepSeek and recent noise around data centers, they stated.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our positive view on AI semiconductors and leading cloud platforms, and recommend investors take advantage of elevated near-term volatility by buying the dip in quality AI stocks or through structured strategies.\u201d\n\nInvestors were skeptical ahead of the print considering how rival DeepSeek\u2019s less power-hungry nature could imply an overspend by US tech giants on AI infrastructure without sufficient return in that investment. Nonetheless, AI players are continuing to announce plans to funnel tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, $325 billion in capital expenditures is expected this year from just the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech companies. Moreover, a majority of this spend is aimed at supporting AI growth.\n\n\u201cWe have seen NOT ONE AI enterprise deployment slow down or change due to the DeepSeek situation. No customer wants to \u2018lose their place in line\u2019 as it is described to us for Nvidias next gen chips.\u201d\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "The Alibaba logo is seen outside its offices in Beijing in February 2025\n\nBeijing launched a regulatory blitz on the industry in 2020 that triggered a massive sell-off, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars from major tech firms' market value.\n\nBut there are increasing signals that it is adopting a friendlier attitude, as domestic economic woes persist and leaders nervously eye a heightened trade war with the United States.\n\n\"Beijing cannot accomplish its national ambitions of technological independence from the United States and ultimate dominance of cutting-edge technologies without the private sector,\" Shehzad Qazi, managing director of China Beige Book, told AFP.\n\nThe shock release in late January of a sophisticated AI chatbot by Hangzhou-based start-up DeepSeek -- which matched US rivals' performance seemingly at a fraction of the cost -- could be seen as a stark example of that.\n\nDeepSeek was praised by authorities, with its founder also present at the high-level business symposium where Xi met Ma in Beijing nearly two weeks ago.\n\nXi's warm greeting of the Alibaba co-founder, who had stayed out of the spotlight since making disparaging comments about the nation's regulators in 2020, is \"the latest sign of China more firmly aligning private enterprises with the (Communist) Party's economic and national security ambitions\", said Qazi.\n\nBut he warned that \"Beijing isn't interested in helping companies produce record-breaking earnings or spurring mega rallies in the stock market\".\n\n\"The outlook for private enterprises is not nearly as bright as the recent market optimism would have you believe,\" he said.\n\nObservers are keenly awaiting a key annual political gathering in Beijing in the coming days, in the hope it might show whether the government's recently warmed attitude will translate into concrete actions.\n\nEnter AI\n\nA softening towards the tech sector has been under way since 2023, with regulators taking a more supportive stance in a bid to revive business confidence.\n\nChina has struggled to meet official growth goals over the past few years as the world's number two economy is beset by a property sector crisis and sluggish consumption.\n\nStimulus measures unveiled last year are slowly taking effect, but a threatened trade war with US President Donald Trump's new administration could cause further economic instability.\n\nWith hurdles yet to be overcome, Beijing is now eyeing tech products -- AI in particular -- with renewed interest.\n\nUpstart Deepseek has changed the AI game in China \u00a9 Hector RETAMAL / AFP/File\n\n\"In theory, AI can help China break through stagnation and deflation\" in addition to solving the future labour crunch caused by the country's declining population, analysts at ANZ Research wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe symposium of business leaders, they wrote, showed that adoption of AI in China now stands to be further accelerated by revamped policy support.\n\nLocal authorities across the country have in recent weeks issued orders to promote the use of AI tools such as DeepSeek to assist in governance.\n\n\"DeepSeek's success in AI has revived investor hopes for broader AI adoption and increased enterprise demand in China,\" said UBS in a note.\n\nThe DeepSeek phenomenon has also ignited an intense race within the domestic industry to develop advanced chatbots, with Tencent's release Thursday of its Hunyuan Turbo S model representing the newest contestant.\n\nTencent claims the new model's instant responses differentiate it from DeepSeek, which it said needs to \"think before answering\", resulting in slight delays in generating results.\n\n'Moment's notice'\n\nIn a move to reassure the business community, Chinese lawmakers last month advanced a draft law on the private sector that the state-backed Global Times said would \"cement legal protection\" for firms.\n\nBut analysts say a private-sector boom will only be encouraged as long as it aligns with Beijing's strategic objectives.\n\nDuring the 2010s tech giants were allowed to rapidly grow, but the Communist Party has historically been wary of runaway private-sector expansion.\n\nThe recent gathering with entrepreneurs has echoes of a similar one held in 2018, when Xi told business leaders he was there to \"boost (their) confidence\".\n\nTwo years later Beijing launched its flurry of anti-monopoly and anti-competition charges against the firms.\n\n\"Investors appear to have interpreted (the meeting with Xi and Ma) as a signal that the government's pivot towards greater private-sector freedom, which has been underway since 2023, is set to be sustained,\" wrote James Reilly, a senior economist at Capital Economics.\n\nHowever, he added that the \"lack of checks and balances in China means that this attitude shift towards the tech sector could reverse at a moment's notice\".\n\n\u00a9 2025 AFP",

            "content": "Chinese stocks struggled today after President Donald Trump said additional tariffs on Chinese imports are slated to go into effect Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 3.3%, suffering one of its worst days since mid October.\n\nShares of Alibaba (BABA -1.35%) traded 2.7% lower as of 11:30 a.m. ET, while shares of Tencent (TCEHY -1.00%) traded 2.4% lower. Shares of GDS Holdings (GDS -8.56%) initially slid almost 8% in pre-market trading but had recouped most of those losses by 11: 30.\n\nTrump may be more serious about tariffs than people thought\n\nInvestors who thought tariffs would be more of a negotiating tactic will see their thesis put to the test next week after Trump said that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that he previously paused will go into effect Tuesday. Meanwhile, he also said there would be an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. While China's response to Trump's initial 10% tariffs was more muted, officials didn't hold back this time.\n\n\"If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will take all necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests,\" a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, according to CNBC. \"We urge the U.S. side to not repeat its own mistakes, and to return as soon as possible to the right track of properly resolving conflicts through dialogue on equal footing.\"\n\nChinese tech stocks had been on a tear this year, with the emergence of DeepSeek leading investors to grow bullish on artificial intelligence in the country. Furthermore, with China's economy still struggling, the government had seemingly thrown its support behind the tech sector. President Xi Jinping recently held a rare meeting with tech and start-up leaders in the country that largely encouraged the group.\n\nStill, the additional tariffs throw a wrench in what had been a badly needed rally for Chinese stocks.\n\n\"The extra 10% is frustrating because it keeps uncertainty alive and reinforces the risk that this becomes a pattern,\" Billy Leung, an investment strategist at Global X ETFs, was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News article. In the same article, Kristina Clifton, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, was quoted as saying her team expects the Chinese government to bolster spending to try and reduce the impact of tariffs on the Chinese economy.\n\nInvesting in China means dealing with geopolitical tensions\n\nWhen you invest in Chinese stocks, the regulatory landscape in China and geopolitical tensions are going to be a big part of the story. Tariffs and export controls by the U.S. have been in play since Trump's first term and through former President Joe Biden's term, and have now ramped up even further in Trump's second term.\n\nMany believed Trump would use tariffs as more of a bargaining chip, and this may be the end result. However, the administration likely at least needs the market to take tariffs seriously for a little while. Trump has also been unpredictable, so it's hard to say with certainty that he won't go through with his full tariff agenda.\n\nDue to the struggles in China's economy and the stock market in 2024, investors can likely buy most Chinese tech stocks at cheaper valuations than those in the U.S., and a lot of these companies have tremendous growth prospects. However, they will likely be volatile due to factors like geopolitical tensions or China's regulatory regime, so keep this in mind and take a long-term approach if you invest.",

            "content": "Alibaba (BABA -1.35%) shares got a nice boost following the Chinese company's fiscal third-quarter results, which showed a nice rebound in its e-commerce business as well as strong artificial intelligence (AI) growth.\n\nThe stock has had a tough past five years, losing about a third of its value, but it has been rallying lately. The stock is now up about 70% year to date and has nearly doubled over the past year as of this writing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Alibaba's most recent earnings to see if the stock's rally can continue.\n\nThe turnaround is taking shape\n\nAlibaba's largest business remains its e-commerce segment, which consists of leading Chinese e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China's premier e-commerce marketplace where established brands sell their merchandise, while Taobao is a platform used by both individuals and businesses to sell merchandise.\n\nThe company's e-commerce business has been under pressure the past few years from heavy competition, especially from PDD's Pinduoduo platform, as well as a weak Chinese consumer economy.\n\nHowever, the segment posted solid 5% growth in its fiscal third quarter (ended in December) to $18.6 billion, including 9% growth in its important third-party business. Alibaba credited the growth to higher gross merchandise value (GMV), which is the total value of goods sold through its platforms, and a high take rate (the fees charged by the platforms themselves).\n\nManagement also noted that it was seeing more uptake of its new AI marketing tool Quanzhantui, and that it benefited from the new software service fee it implemented. Its segment earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) rose 2% to $8.4 billion.\n\nThe company said it is also seeing solid customer growth. This included double-digit growth for its 88VIP premium memberships, which reached 49 million at the quarter's end.\n\nIts cloud intelligence group, or cloud computing segment, saw revenue jump 13% to $4.3 billion. AI-related revenue soared by triple digits for the sixth straight quarter. The segment's adjusted EBITA, meanwhile, climbed 33% to $430 million. The company touted its foundational AI model Qwen 2.5-Max, noting its industry-leading performance.\n\nAlibaba said it will invest aggressively in AI infrastructure, with plans to spend more in the next three years than it has over the last decade. It said its goal is to achieve AGI (artificial general intelligence), where AI can attain 80% of human capabilities.\n\nThe company's other businesses also generally showed strong revenue growth, led by a 32% increase to $5.2 billion from its international commerce segment (AIDC). These emerging businesses continue to scale up but are currently largely unprofitable.\n\nHowever, management is looking for AIDC to turn in its first profitable quarter within the next fiscal year. That would be a big improvement from the $678 million EBITA loss it reported in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nOverall, Alibaba's revenue rose 8% to $38.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per American depositary share climbed 13% to $2.93, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 4% to $7.5 billion. Free cash flow came in at $5.3 billion.\n\nAlibaba ended the quarter with $54.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $31.7 billion in debt. It also had $47.4 billion in equity and other investments on its balance sheet.\n\nIs it too late to buy Alibaba stock?\n\nAlibaba has invested heavily to help turn around its e-commerce businesses, and this quarter bore the fruit of those efforts. Its GMV had been improving, but this quarter, it was able to take that GMV growth and translate it into solid increases in revenue and EBITA. Its Quanzhantui marketing tool appears to be gaining traction, while there was no detrimental impact from the small technology service charge it introduced.\n\nThe company also continues to be an AI leader in China. It recently won a deal with Apple to provide the AI behind Apple Intelligence in China, while it continues to see solid growth in its cloud computing unit. Meanwhile, it is still benefiting from a profitability standpoint as low-margin contracts expire.\n\nAnd the Chinese government appears to be fully behind the country's tech companies in the AI race. Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who had been persona non grata after criticizing China's financial sector in 2020, was recently photographed with other business leaders meeting with China's president, Xi Jinping.\n\nThe Chinese government has had its differences with the tech sector in the past, but Xi has encouraged these companies to innovate and grow. That's all good news for a company like Alibaba.\n\nLooking at valuation, Alibaba stock remains cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) under 15 for fiscal 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) under 0.4, with PEGs below 1 usually view as undervalued.\n\nWith the stock still inexpensive and a turnaround taking hold, Alibaba remains an attractive investment. The company is becoming a Chinese AI leader, which should help lift its valuation multiple, while flipping its AIDC business to profitability should also be a nice lift to earnings.",

            "content": "The CNBC TV host also commented on AI and Elon Musk's xAI announcing its Grok 3 model Cramer thought \"it [Grok 3] was okay. I think it was okay. I don't know, I caught ChatGPT hallucinating like mad yesterday. No, look, Grok 3's okay.\" When asked whether AI could displace a substantive portion of jobs, he shared:\n\n\"Well look we always know why that it was a parochial view that Gensler took. Uh, Tim Massad over at the CFTC didn't take that view. He said it's going to be huge overseas because they got even less faith in their currencies than we have. And it's got a lot more portability than gold. Look I'm a huge believer in it. I don't know if I'm a believer in the big buck, but I am a believer in Bitcoin because I believe the thirty-six trillion, I don't know what to do with the thirty-six trillion in debt. I haven't figured that out yet, David. I thought when you spoke to Mnuchin, you would push the fifty-year bond that you know I'm a huge believer in.\"\n\nAnother hot topic that caught Cramer's attention was the SEC purportedly dropping its lawsuit against one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the US. He shared:\n\nWhen asked if he didn't have a problem with Musk splitting his between two companies \"No, I don't think that Dorsey, I did give him grief because it wasn't clear that he was for everyone. This guy favors every. . . .look I, he is remarkable. I just don't want him to show up here.\" He added: \"Look what do you do, when it says, Elon Musk on line two? What do you do?\"\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer shared his thoughts about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk's role in the government, and its impact on his companies. Commenting on industry concerns about his government efficiency initiatives impacting his companies, Cramer shared that his car, AI, and rocket companies have \"seen valuations soar in recent months. So, again, the complainers, they really have to re-think their view.\" Musk \"is creating wealth,\" Cramer believes as he added that \"he's [Musk] changing the government. Cramer then wondered \"is he President Musk?\" and asked, \"Who is The Apprentice?\"\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses These 12 Stocks, Elon Musk & President Trump . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I do think that there are few employees in areas that are drone-like, but there are more employees in areas that really matter. I know Salesforce, really interesting that they're talking about, you know lack of code. But they are putting people in a much more substantive position. I think banks will do that too.\"\n\nReturning to Musk's DOGE, he shared:\n\n\"Uh, okay so there's this piece in The Atlantic. 'This Is What Happens When The DOGE Guys Take Over,' I want everyone to read this piece. Because what it is, is they come in and they take over your computer and they find out what's wrong. And it is devastating. Because they're going into companies and really, and they're going into agencies, and just taking over. It's a great article. It's heavily sourced. And one of the things that's really clear about it is they're winning. They're winning. They're finding things. And they tend to be in agencies so far which are, you know, I think of like the Consumer Financial Safety Board. They're in there heavily. They tend be on to agencies that frankly many people would say, Democrat agencies. Democrat agencies.\"\n\nAs for DOGE rapidly firing and re-hiring people, he commented: \"This thing is done so ad-hoc, uh, there is, there's almost no due process whatsoever. If you overwhelm the courts, and just make it so that they have to constantly take up these matters then, then DOGE wins. That seems to be the pattern. They can overwhelm the court system with all these different, if they just keep going after agency, after agency.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) the Cheap Global Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 107\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the largest technology companies in China. Like its American counterpart Amazon, the firm enjoys the benefit of a dual business model. Its business model gives Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) the ability to benefit from a high-volume eCommerce business and a high-margin cloud platform. The firm's shares have gained 88% over the past year, primarily on the back of a stunning 69% year-to-date run in 2025. Multiple catalysts have driven the stock, including a regulatory crackdown on a rival, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)'s AI model, and Chinese stimulus. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\"Well BABA, we've got two streams of revenue that are explosive so to speak. One is cloud, and the other is eCommerce. Now, it's very clear that the PRC, the party has said look, we want more spending. And that's the eCommerce. And when it comes to the cloud, well that, you could say that's DeepSeek, they really know what they're doing over there. And by the way, Jensen Huang, has been quiet but there is a piece, this morning, that don't worry, it's really post-training. That's a more sophisticated way to put it, but he's broken his silence. But Alibaba can, when I speak to David Tepper, I mean it's very clear, Alibaba is still inexpensive. I don't like the idea that you're coming in at this level. But the fact that they have two revenue streams that are on fire not one really speaks to how China wants to promote spend and how brilliant they turned out to be in terms of technology.\"\n\nOverall BABA ranks 8th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Our analysis suggests that investors might be missing some promising details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\n\nFor anyone who wants to understand Alibaba Group Holding's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by CN\u00a527b due to unusual items. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Alibaba Group Holding to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Alibaba Group Holding's Profit Performance\n\nBecause unusual items detracted from Alibaba Group Holding's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Because of this, we think Alibaba Group Holding's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! Better yet, its EPS are growing strongly, which is nice to see. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. Obviously, we love to consider the historical data to inform our opinion of a company. But it can be really valuable to consider what other analysts are forecasting. Luckily, you can check out .\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Alibaba Group Holding's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

            "content": "The Chinese E-Commerce Marketplace\n\nWhen talking about online marketplaces, the dominant company seems to be Amazon, with its astonishing multi-decade growth and its $1.8T market capitalization. But this is not the whole story.\n\nWhile Amazon dominates the North American market, it is fiercely struggling with other large marketplaces abroad. For example, Amazon has been struggling to compete with MercadoLibre in the South American markets and with SEA in Southeast Asia.\n\nAbove all, the Chinese e-commerce platforms stand out, benefiting from direct access to the massive and low-cost Chinese manufacturing ecosystem and a local market of 1.5 billion people. In total, 44% of global e-commerce sales are through Chinese e-commerce platforms.\n\nOne of these marketplaces is now out-competing Amazon in Europe, as Alibaba became the continent's biggest online marketplace in 2023 . So, far from being only competitive in its \u201cprotected\u201d home market in China, Alibaba is now a powerhouse marching to conquer international markets.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited BABA +0.48% )\n\nAmazon Vs Alibaba\n\nBefore exploring Alibaba\u2019s business further, it is worth comparing it to its more famous and richly valued competitor.\n\nAmazon generated $604B in revenue in the twelve months ending September 2024 , with $44B in net income. In comparison, Alibaba generated $133B (950 billion yuan) over the same period , with $9.7B in net income. So overall, it could be said that Alibaba is 1/4th of Amazon. However, with a market capitalization of $196B compared to Amazon's $1.8T, it is valued at 1/10th of Amazon.\n\nIn the past few years, Amazon's revenue has grown by 10-12% yearly . Meanwhile, Alibaba's growth has been a bit more irregular, boasting a contraction in 2023 (-6%) and only 3% growth for 2024.\n\nOverall, Alibaba can be said to be valued with much lower multiples due to lower growth recently, in part caused by China's longer-lasting COVID lockdown than in the rest of the world and its economy struggling from a deflating real estate bubble.\n\nAdditional factors are the US-China trade tensions , as well as a crackdown of the CCP on Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, in 2022 .\n\nAlibaba Structure\n\nAlibaba was launched in 1999 and has grown progressively into a massive company with many divisions. Recently, it was reorganized into six major segments.\n\nTaobao & Tmall\n\nThis is the largest part of the business and the leader in the Chinese e-commerce market, with a strong focus on the retail market. After a period of losing market share to its local competitors, it has restarted to grow in Q2 2024 at high-single-digit online GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) and double-digit order growth.\n\nThis restart of growth was achieved through several means:\n\nBetter algorithmic recommendation and product match to increase conversion.\n\nIncreasing price-competitive offerings through diversification of suppliers.\n\nThe launch in April of Quanzhantui , a new AI-powered platform-wide marketing tool for merchants, providing automated bidding, optimized targeting, and performance dashboard visualization.\n\n, a new AI-powered platform-wide marketing tool for merchants, providing automated bidding, optimized targeting, and performance dashboard visualization. A new AI Chatbot called Dianxiaomi, now available to all merchants.\n\nThe release of AI tools to all merchants is in line with the long-standing principle of Alibaba being a level-playing field tool for SMEs to compete with larger companies.\n\nThis was key to Alibaba's historical success, as it allowed it to leverage the hundreds of thousands of smaller companies and entrepreneurs in Chinese society, creating at the time an unprecedented abundance of products and designs at competitive prices.\n\nAlibaba's 88VIP membership (similar to Amazon Prime) has also been growing at double digits. It offers shopping discounts, exclusive prices, take-away red packets, and watching videos without advertisements.\n\nOverall, Tmall is still one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the country, with only Douyin (TikTok out of China) able to seriously attack its incumbent position in the last few years.\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\nLarge e-commerce platforms, including Amazon and Alibaba, have to manage massive cloud computing capacity for their platforms. So, it makes sense for them to branch out and offer this existing capability to others.\n\nThis allows them to build their cloud capacity at an even larger scale, reducing costs for both B2B clients of the cloud service, and the internal demand for cloud computing.\n\nToday, the cloud segment is Amazon's most profitable segment. Alibaba Cloud is facing a tougher competitive market in China, with strong contenders being Huawei and Tencent, having taken market share from almost 50% of Alibaba in 2020 to \u201conly\u201d a third of the market today.\n\nThis strong competition should not overshadow that the overall Chinese cloud market is growing very quickly, leading to Alibaba Cloud growing at a double-digit percentage.\n\nA strong point of Alibaba is its adoption of AI in cloud computing, as well as its triple-digit year-over-year growth in the adoption of its AI tools. The AI push includes generative AI like LLMs (Large Language Models), but also custom apps and has cut costs by half, making them a lot more affordable.\n\nAlibaba's AI ambitions are large, with the triple goals of :\n\nDeveloping its own \u201cfoundational models for AI and progress towards AGI\u201d. Integrate their LLM within every Alibaba operations as well as all its customers (from buyers to merchants), creating scale and cost-efficient AI functionalities. Using its proprietary LLM, Tongyi Qianwen 2.0, launched at the end of 2023 , through industry-specific models.\n\nAI Ecosystem\n\nAlibaba is also at the forefront of creating a Chinese AI open-source ecosystem, with the community ModelScope (launched in 2022) , the largest in China, using 2,300 AI models, based on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cModel-as-a-Service\u201d initiative .\n\nWith ModelScope, we aim to simplify and reduce the cost of developing, customizing, and deploying AI models for developers and corporations, thereby enabling the creation of revolutionary AI applications that have a positive impact on society. For instance, FaceChain, a third-party application based on multiple AI models on ModelScope, can generate a portrait from just one or two uploaded photos. We leveraged this model to help some elderly individuals in China develop digital portraits, which delighted them. Zhou Jingren \u2013 Alibaba Cloud's CTO\n\nInternational\n\nThis category includes Alibaba.com (wholesale) and Aliexpress (retail sales), but also Trendyol in Turkey , Miravia in Spain, and Lazada (16.4% market share in SE-Asia e-commerce) .\n\nThis has long been the largest and best-known export marketplace for Chinese goods, long before the arrival of Pinduoduo's Temu in the Western market. It is also the branch responsible for taking over Amazon's top spot in the European markets.\n\nThe segment is growing extremely strongly, with 32% year-to-year growth and a strong performance in selected markets in Europe and the Gulf Region. Revenue from the segment was $3.2B in Q2 2024 from retail and $771M from wholesale.\n\nThe revenue from Alibaba is mirrored by the impact it has on these economies, with exports from 27 European countries via Alibaba's platforms totaling \u20ac32.3B in 2023 and contributing a combined \u20ac57.9 billion to the gross domestic product of Germany, France, Italy, and Spain for the 2019-2023 period.\n\nAlibaba is also exploring alternative models in other markets, such as a partnership with Brazilian Magazine Luiza (\u201cMagalu\u201d) to open and operate a storefront on AliExpress and vice versa.\n\nDue to massive investment into growth, the segment is not profitable yet and lost $510M in Q2 2024.\n\nCainiao\n\nThis is the logistics arm of the Alibaba Group. Its revenue grew 16% year-to-year to $3.6M. The section is mostly there to help cross-border activity and boost the logistical capability of the group as a whole, as well as the capabilities of merchants on Alibaba's platforms.\n\nFor example, it installed a total of 5,000 package lockers globally before Singles Day (a big sales event in Chinese e-commerce), especially in Russia, Poland, Spain, and France.\n\nAnt Group\n\nAnt Group is Alibaba's former financing/banking division. It includes the very popular payment system AliPay, as well as various solutions for online banking, wealth management apps, insurance, loans, etc.\n\nCurrently, Alibaba Group owns 33% of Ant Group. At the end of 2023, a proposed buy-back valued Ant Group at $79B , putting Alibaba\u2019s share at a value of $26B, much lower than the previously expected valuation for the IPO in 2020.\n\nThe group became the target of an investigation by regulatory authorities and saw its planned 2020 IPO canceled at the last minute .\n\nThis was part of an overall effort to reduce the influence of Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma. Today, Ma's voting rights were reduced from 50% to 6% and the Ant Group is a lot more independent than in the past.\n\nThis could open the way for an IPO , as it removes the political risk of the CCP conflict with Jack Ma, but the exact date is still undetermined.\n\nServices & Others\n\nServices\n\nOver the years, Alibaba Group has accumulated an array of secondary businesses. For example, ele.me food delivery service, Amap online map service, as well as digital media and entertainment (Youku, Alibaba picture, Damai),\n\nThese activities are relatively small compared to the rest of the group and operating at a loss.\n\nOthers\n\nThis segment gathers all the other various businesses acquired or developed internally over the year, including DingTalk (office tool), Quark (search engine), Fliggy (travel tickets), Alibaba Health (digital healthcare), and SunArt (online supermarket).\n\nSome investors have criticized these businesses as distractions, and overall, it seems Alibaba\u2019s management is now looking at either turning them profitable or stopping/selling them.\n\nDual Primary Listing And VIE\n\nVIEs\n\nStocks of Chinese companies are often complex structures, due to Chinese laws technically forbidding foreign ownership. At the same time, Chinese companies (and the Chinese government) are eager to raise capital abroad to finance the growth of the country's economy and its corporations.\n\nA compromise was found with the VIE (V ariable I nterest E ntity ) structure . Often based in the Cayman Islands or directly in the US, these corporate structures have a contract with the mother entity (for example, Alibaba in China), guaranteeing part of the profits of the \u201creal company,\u201d replicating ownership, but without direct \u201creal\u201d ownership.\n\nWhile less strong of a claim on the company than direct share ownership, this has been an accepted option to invest in Chinese companies for many years.\n\nHowever, a secondary issue is that Alibaba was publicly listed in the US, reducing its stock accessibility to Chinese investors.\n\nDual Primary Listing\n\nDue to the listing complexities, Alibaba was mostly off-limits for most of China's 210 million active retail investors \u2013 a pity when considering the reach and brand power of the company in its home market. It was especially a missed opportunity as a key factor in Alibaba's low stock price (fear of sanctions) would not be relevant for Chinese investors.\n\nTo solve this, the company has changed its listing structure, achieving a dual primary listing status . So the company has become dual primary listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange from August 29th.\n\nThis is also in line with the CCP's goal of keeping/making Hong Kong an international finance hub independent of Western investors and capital.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Valuation\n\nThere is definitely a \u201cChina discount\u201d being applied to Chinese stock valuation, with world-class companies like Tencent, Alibaba, Jinko Solar, or CATL trading at a much lower valuation than their American counterparts.\n\nPart of this discount is rational, with geopolitical tensions and trade conflict flaring between the US and China, with the background of China's goal of reunification with Taiwan and US critics of Chinese support to Russia. We can, however, roughly calculate the scale of this discount.\n\nFirst, we can consider that part of Alibaba's value includes the $26B worth of participation in the Ant Group (which has been trading at a discount since the canceled 2020 IPO). In addition, the company has net tangible assets worth $96.6B, of which $80B is in cash.\n\nSo depending whether we want to consider just cash or net assets, together with Ant Group, this puts the other activities at the current valuation ($196B) minus $106B or $122B (cash or net asset + Ant Group).\n\nThis puts at a $74B-$90B valuation a business with:\n\n1/4 th of Amazon revenues.\n\nof Amazon revenues. The leading market share of China\u2019s e-commerce sector (around 1/3 rd of the total).\n\nof the total). The number one position in Europe\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nControlling 1/3 rd of the Chinese cloud market.\n\nof the Chinese cloud market. Now accessible to domestic Chinese investors, very familiar with the company and unconcerned with risks of delisting from US markets.\n\nReturns To Shareholders\n\nAt the end of 2023, Alibaba distributed its first-ever dividends , looking to put to rest the idea that Chinese corporations do not return capital to shareholders.\n\nThe group aims to lift its return on invested capital into the double digits in the coming years.\n\nIt has also initiated a massive share repurchase program, taking advantage of the depressed share prices. In the last 3 years, the company reduced total shares by 9.5%, having spent $30B at an average price of $102/share.\n\nIf the repurchase of $10B / year continues, this would result at the current price in a 3-4% total share count reduction per year, on top of the current 2.5% dividend yield, not counting the growth of the business.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba is not a risk-free investment, with its leading position in e-commerce having attracted mostly value-destructive strong attention from both the Chinese and US governments, leading to a multi-year stock price decline.\n\nIt also operates in a very competitive environment, with the Chinese e-commerce and cloud computing sector being a lot more competitive than in the West. In that context, while Alibaba is not disappearing tomorrow, it constantly needs to fend off competition from PDD/Temu, Douyin/Tiktok, Tencent, Huawei, etc., more so than from Western competitors.\n\nIt is however still a very strong leader in all its main segments of Chinese e-commerce, international e-commerce, and cloud computing, with a large ownership in the fintech giant Ant Group.\n\nLess tense relations with the CCP & a related potential IPO of the Ant Group, continuous growth in cloud, e-commerce, and international segments, as well as the Chinese economy growing back at 5% yearly, are all strong supports for a revaluation of the stock at some point in the future.\n\nThe company is also putting behind the Jack Ma era and seems to progressively find its new marks with a renewed management team and a reorganized group.\n\nCombined with a low market capitalization discounting the core business at less than $100B (versus Amazon's $1.8T), Alibaba is a value investor pick. It has also regularly disappointed in the past few years, with a declining and then stagnant stock price. So, it is not without risk, either, and investors should carefully consider both the risks and potential of the stock.\n\nLatest on Alibaba",

The consumer discretionary and tech stock is up by 52% this year as of the Feb. 25 close. The company\u2019s cloud computing business impressed investors in its latest earnings release on Feb. 20.\n\nShares rose 8% in response. A few days later, Alibaba said it plans to spend more than $52 billion on cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the next three years.\n\nGet Alibaba Group alerts: Sign Up\n\nSo, what should we make of these recent developments around Alibaba? Will its strength continue and allow the stock to be a big long-term winner? I\u2019ll look to answer these questions by diving into the firm\u2019s recent earnings and analyzing its strategic positioning.\n\nBreaking Down Alibaba\u2019s Impressive Earnings Results\n\nIn Alibaba\u2019s latest results, its revenues were essentially in line with what analysts expected. However, the big beat came on adjusted earnings per share. Its $2.95 figure surpassed forecasts by over 10%. Growth in the company\u2019s cloud intelligence and international digital commerce segments was impressive. The former grew by 13%, and the latter by 32%.\n\nImpressively, Cloud Intelligence revenue growth has been accelerating every quarter for some time now. In Q4 2023, this part of the business grew by less than 3%. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Eddie Wu mentioned that AI-related products have been key to this. Revenue from these products grew by over 100% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Its Chinese e-commerce segment, known as Taobao and Tmall, saw sales rise moderately by 5%.\n\nUnderstanding BABA\u2019s Cloud and AI Position\n\nAlibaba\u2019s $53 billion investment plan for cloud and AI infrastructure over three years equates to around $18 billion a year. That\u2019s significantly less than the approximately $40 billion Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT is looking to invest over just the next two quarters. However, it is still very large when considering that Alibaba\u2019s cloud business is much smaller.\n\nAlibaba Group Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$144.07\n\n5.17% Upside Buy\n\nBased on 15 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $190.00 Average Forecast $144.07 Low Forecast $100.00 Alibaba Group Stock Forecast Details\n\nThe company's cloud revenue reached $14 billion in the last year. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud revenue of nearly $26 billion just last quarter completely dwarfs this amount. However, compared to the size of its cloud computing business, Alibaba's planned spending is significantly larger.\n\nTo be clear, Alibaba isn\u2019t competing directly with companies like Microsoft. It is competing with other Chinese companies in cloud computing. Still, comparing this planned spending highlights that the race to \"win AI\" isn't just happening among U.S. companies. Many see advancing AI as an existential national security issue, and China can\u2019t simply sit still.\n\nWinners will emerge in that country just as they will in the United States. As of Q3 2024, Alibaba held the largest market share of cloud infrastructure revenue in China at 36%. That is almost double that of the next closest player. Right now, Alibaba appears to be the leading horse and is making a huge commitment going forward.\n\nGovernment-Related Considerations and Final Thoughts on BABA\n\nFor several years now, investing in the Chinese stock market has been difficult. Over the past five years, the iShares MSCI China ETF NASDAQ: MCHI has provided a total return of -4%. In the same period, the S&P 500 Index has had a return of nearly 99%. Government interference in the economy has caused major turmoil. Many investors avoid the country's stocks completely. However, this also suggests that these stocks may have significant potential to appreciate.\n\nIn my view, the Chinese government must unleash its private tech companies to compete with the U.S. in AI. There is evidence that tensions between government officials and tech leaders in the country are easing.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping had a rare meeting recently with key Chinese tech leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma. The meeting was pro-business, indicating the government is moving toward working more with its tech companies than against them.\n\nOverall, someone is going to have to help China advance its cloud and AI technology. There doesn\u2019t appear to be anyone more equipped to do that at this point than Alibaba. Given trends in the business and Chinese government signaling, I\u2019m bullish on shares of Alibaba. Some Wall Street analysts see the near-term rally as far from over as well. The average implied upside of seven price targets tracked by MarketBeat post earnings is 24% as of the Feb. 25 close.\n\nBefore you consider Alibaba Group, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Alibaba Group wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Alibaba Group currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "Alibaba Cloud has open sourced its family of video foundation models to provide businesses and researchers with access to video creation capabilities.\n\nThe four models in the Tongyi Wanxiang (Wan) 2.1 family, comprising both 14 billion and 1.3 billion parameter versions, are designed to generate high-quality videos from text and image inputs. The models are available for download on Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI model community, Model Scope, as well as Hugging Face.\n\nAccording to Alibaba Cloud, Wan 2.1 distinguishes itself as the first video-generation model to support text effects in both Chinese and English. Its proficiency in generating realistic visuals is attributed to its ability to handle complex movements, enhance pixel quality, adhere to physical principles and optimise the precision of instruction execution.\n\nThese capabilities have propelled Wan 2.1 to the top of the VBench leaderboard, a benchmark suite for video generative models. It is also the only open-source model among the top five on Hugging Face\u2019s VBench leaderboard.\n\nThe different models cater to varying needs and computational resources. The 14B model excels in creating high-quality visuals with complex motion dynamics, while the 1.3B model, which balances generation quality with computational efficiency, will allow users with standard laptops to generate a five-second 480p video in about four minutes.\n\nTraining video foundation models requires a vast amount of computing resources and high-quality training data. Open source can lower the barrier for more businesses to leverage AI, enabling them to create high-quality visual content tailored to their needs in a cost-effective way.\n\nBesides Wan 2.1, Alibaba Cloud has also open sourced its Qwen foundation models, which have ranked highly on the HuggingFace Open LLM leaderboards with performance comparable to leading global models. Currently, over 100,000 derivative models built upon the Qwen family exist on Hugging Face, making it one of the largest AI model families worldwide.\n\nThe company also provides the AI Model Studio that lets large enterprises access its foundation models and model training tools to speed up deployment of large language models in a controlled environment.\n\nWith Model studio, they can monitor and identify risky content, and filter or block undesirable information based on responsible AI principles. They can also train foundation models by creating, labelling and managing training datasets, customise model training with adjustable parameters, as well as evaluate and deploy foundation models easily.\n\nEarlier this week, Alibaba Cloud said it will invest RMB 380 billion (US$53bn) in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure over the next three years, surpassing its total spending on cloud and AI in the past decade.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cloud intelligence unit reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the latest quarter, excluding consolidated subsidiaries. Its AI-related product revenue grew in the triple-digit range for the sixth consecutive quarter, thanks to rising demand for its AI hosting and related offerings.",

            "content": "As the Ukraine conflict unfolded in Eastern Europe, some tendencies from the times of the Cold War proliferated again, with the East and the West isolating each other, as the USA and Europe aligned to support Ukraine, while China had the back of Russia. The aforementioned \u201cold\u201d alliances were shattered, and each region started to face new problems \u2013 the EU\u2019s energy security faced unprecedented risks, with energy prices skyrocketing across central and eastern Europe, leading to a slowdown in economic growth and tremendous pressure on the regular consumer. The US and China escalated the trade wars that had their roots in the previous decade \u2013 in an attempt to protect its technological leadership, particularly in the AI field, the US imposed restrictions to export semiconductor equipment used in the production of state-of-the-art chips, such as powerful GPUs to train AI models. China imposed some retaliatory restrictions regarding several strategic commodities sourced by the US. Even though the trade wars are still not fully enforced by both parties, the tensions persist and have deep implications for the financial markets and the global economy.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape has drastically changed since the beginning of the decade, with the COVID-19 pandemic followed by worldwide spikes in inflation leading to completely different economic tendencies if compared to the previous decade. The conflict in Ukraine brought even more geopolitical turmoil, with many analysts believing that this war represents the end of several political and economic alliances, notably between Europe and Russia on the one hand, and between the USA and China on the other hand. The first so-called alliance of the past led to strong economic growth in both the EU and Russia, as the former used cheap energy and commodities from Russia to fuel its industrial sector (particularly that of Germany), while Russia itself had the freedom to export its capital and source the technology and talent it needed for development. The second so-called alliance, between the USA and China, fueled unprecedented growth in China, in a journey to secure the American market and industry with cheap electronics, components, consumer products, and everything the country needed to grow its technological leadership.\n\nWe recently published a list of 7 Cheap Global Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other cheap global stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs geographic markets became more disconnected, the stock markets in the USA, Europe, and APAC had quite different performances, with the former leading by a wide margin in 2023-2024. For reference, the 5-year performance of the German stock market lagged that of the US by 57%, China lagged the US by 94%, and Japan lagged the US by 58%. In light of the proliferating geopolitical challenges, which still persist as the new Trump 2.0 administration threatens tariffs on its supposed allies as well as China again, we believe that global companies that are diversified across geographies will be the most favored in the years to come, due to stronger potential to diversify idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, as the US stock market is currently near all-time highs after a stellar 2023-2024 period, cheap companies trading under 15.0x forward P/E might be the only viable option to buy in the current expensive market. Successful investors like Warren Buffet acknowledged that an overstretched valuation could hinder the subsequent performance of a stock. Here\u2019s precisely what he said during his 1998 letter to shareholders:\n\n\u201cFor the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a Finviz screener to filter the largest stocks trading at under 15x forward P/E and analyzed the companies\u2019 filings in order to identify 7 promising global companies that generated at least 40% of revenue in the last financial year from outside the US. For each company, we also include the number of hedge funds that own the company as of Q4 2024 and rank them in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) the Cheap Global Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nForward P/E ratio as of February 24th: 13.13x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is China\u2019s leading e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse, operating a vast digital ecosystem that spans online retail, logistics, fintech, and enterprise services. Its core e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, dominate China\u2019s online shopping landscape, while Alibaba Cloud is a key player in Asia\u2019s cloud infrastructure market. The company has faced regulatory pressures and shifting macroeconomic conditions in recent years, prompting strategic restructuring to enhance agility and unlock shareholder value.\n\nIn the latest 3Q 2025, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) demonstrated accelerating growth momentum in its core businesses after a year of transformation, with largely completed divestments of offline assets. The company\u2019s cloud business pursued an integrated AI plus cloud strategy, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit YoY growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In e-commerce, Taobao and Tmall showed strong growth in new consumers and orders, with CMR growing 9% year-over-year and 88 VIP members reaching 49 million. The international e-commerce business maintained strong growth with improved operating efficiency, with AIDC expected to achieve its first quarter of profitability in the next fiscal year.\n\nLooking ahead, management plans significant investments in three key areas over the next three years: infrastructure for AI and cloud computing, AI foundation models and AI native applications, and transforming existing businesses with AI. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\u2019s planned investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next 3 years is set to exceed what they have spent over the past decade. Financially, the company reported total consolidated revenue of RMB 280.2 billion, an increase of 8%, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA increasing 4% to RMB 54.9 billion. The company maintains a strong net cash position of RMB 378.5 billion ($51.9 billion), providing sufficient resources for its planned AI investments. At the same time, despite the accelerating business outlook, BABA trades at a cheap 13.13x forward P/E, which makes it one of the best cheap global stocks to invest in.\n\nOverall, BABA ranks 1st on our list of cheap global stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This financial performance, with sales growing from CNY 260,348 million to CNY 280,154 million and net income surging to CNY 49,127 million, aligns with a remarkable 61% increase in the company's share price over the last quarter. Additionally, Alibaba's extensive share buyback program, where 119 million shares were repurchased, likely influenced investor sentiment positively. These developments occurred amid mixed market conditions, where major indices showed slight variances, with the Dow Jones rising 0.7% while the S&P 500 experienced a minor decline. The broader market faced headwinds due to potential tariffs, yet Alibaba's positive earnings trajectory and significant buyback initiative appeared to have insulated its stock performance against these external factors.\n\nNYSE:BABA Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nThe last year has seen Alibaba Group Holding produce a total shareholder return of 90.46%. This impressive performance distinguishes the company from the Multiline Retail industry, which had a return of 25.1%, and the broader US market, which achieved 16.9%. Several factors may have contributed to Alibaba's exceptional returns. Key earnings announcements throughout the year displayed significant year-over-year growth in sales and net income, with a striking rise in basic and diluted EPS in Q3. These robust results likely bolstered investor confidence and exerted a positive influence on the share price.\n\nThe company further supported its share value through a substantial share buyback program. By repurchasing 414 million shares between July and September 2024 and an additional 119 million shares in the final quarter of the same year, Alibaba likely maintained strong investor sentiment. Furthermore, the announcement of a special dividend in May 2024 provided additional appeal to shareholders, enhancing the company's overall returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Generated by Qwen\n\n|\n\nAlibaba Cloud said on Wednesday that it has made its AI models for video generation freely available as part of its latest efforts to contribute to the open-source community.\n\nThe cloud computing company is open-sourcing four models of its 14-billion(B)-parameter and 1.3-billion(B)-parameter versions of the Wan2.1 series, the latest iteration of its video foundation model Tongyi Wanxiang (Wan).\n\nThe four models, including T2V-14B, T2V-1.3B, I2V-14B-720P, and I2V-14B-480P, are designed to generate high-quality images and videos from text and image inputs. They are available for download on Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI model community, Model Scope, and the collaborative AI platform Hugging Face, accessible to academics, researchers, and commercial institutions worldwide.\n\nUnveiled earlier this year, the Wan2.1 series is the first video generation model to support text effects in both Chinese and English. It excels at generating realistic visuals by accurately handling complex movements, enhancing pixel quality, adhering to physical principles, and optimizing the precision of instruction execution. Its precision in following instructions has propelled Wan2.1 to the top of the VBench leaderboard, a comprehensive benchmark suite for video generative models. It is also the only open-source video generation model among the top five on the VBench leaderboard of Hugging Face.\n\nAccording to VBench, the Wan2.1 series, with an overall score of 86.22%, leads in key dimensions such as dynamic degree, spatial relationships, color, and multi-object interactions.\n\nTraining video foundation models requires immense computing resources and vast amounts of high-quality training data. Open access helps lower the barrier for more businesses to leverage AI, enabling them to create high-quality visual content tailored to their needs cost-effectively.\n\nThe T2V-14B model is better suited for creating high-quality visuals with substantial motion dynamics. In contrast, the T2V-1.3B model balances generation quality and computational power, making it ideal for a broad range of developers conducting secondary development and academic research. For example, the T2V-1.3B model allows users with standard personal laptops to generate a 5-second-long video at 480p resolution in as little as around 4 minutes.\n\nText prompt: \u4e00\u540d\u7537\u5b50\u5728\u8df3\u53f0\u4e0a\u505a\u4e13\u4e1a\u8df3\u6c34\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u5168\u666f\u5e73\u62cd\u955c\u5934\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u7a7f\u7740\u7ea2\u8272\u6cf3\u88e4\uff0c\u8eab\u4f53\u5448\u5012\u7acb\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u53cc\u81c2\u4f38\u5c55\uff0c\u53cc\u817f\u5e76\u62e2\u3002\u955c\u5934\u4e0b\u79fb\uff0c\u4ed6\u8df3\u5165\u6c34\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e85\u8d77\u6c34\u82b1\u3002\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u84dd\u8272\u7684\u6cf3\u6c60\u3002English translation: \u201cIn a wide-angle, frontal shot, a man dives from the platform in red swim trunks, arms out and legs together. As the camera lowers, he leaps into the water, creating splashes, with the blue pool in the background.\u201d\n\nThe I2V-14B-720P and I2V-14B-480P models support text-to-video generation and offer image-to-video capabilities. To generate dynamic video content, users simply need to input a single image along with a brief text description. The platform supports normal-sized image inputs of any dimension.\n\nAlibaba Cloud was one of the first major global tech companies to open-source its self-developed large-scale AI model, releasing its first open model, Qwen (Qwen-7B), in August 2023. Qwen\u2019s open models have consistently topped the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboards, with performances matching those of leading global AI models across various benchmarks.\n\nAs of now, more than 100,000 derivative models based on the Qwen family of models have been developed on Hugging Face, making it one of the most prominent AI model families worldwide.\n\nLearn more about Alibaba\u2019s Open Source AI Journey",

This is followed by finding trusted suppliers (35%), sourcing new and trendy products to acquire new customers (33%), and finding sustainable products (27%).\n\nMarch Expo 2025\n\nIn addition, nearly half of SMEs in the country (44%) plan to change suppliers*, as they increasingly turn to digital sourcing channels, such as online B2B marketplaces, to find new suppliers, source new products and unlock growth. Just under two thirds (59%) of US SMEs surveyed said digital sourcing\u2020 is more important\u2021 now compared to this time last year. This indicates an increased preference for direct sourcing \u2013 buying goods directly from suppliers, rather than intermediaries.\n\nThe study of 1,000 sourcing decision makers at SMEs in the USA was launched in the run-up to March Expo 2025, Alibaba.com's major B2B sourcing event of the year. March Expo connects buyers and sellers from around the world, helping them discover the latest product opportunities and build new supplier partnerships. During the month, B2B buyers can also shop from thousands of sustainable products and benefit from over two million deals with product certificates.\n\nKuo Zhang, President, Alibaba.com, said: \"US SMEs are becoming more strategic in their sourcing, focusing on affordability, trend responsiveness, and supplier reliability to stay competitive. Our research shows that SMEs are looking beyond cost savings and actively seeking new suppliers to future-proof their businesses. As businesses embrace digital sourcing, they are gaining greater flexibility and access to a wider range of products to support their growth.\"\n\nTo support SMEs in adapting to these changing market dynamics, March Expo 2025 will provide access to more than one million new products at competitive prices and offer coupons valued between $5 and $500 available at check-out. First time orders receive up to $20 off on shipping fees with orders shipped via Alibaba.com.\n\nMarch Expo starts on March 1 on Alibaba.com.\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nThe research was conducted by Censuswide, among a sample of 1,000 decision makers (aged 18+) in US SMEs who are responsible for sourcing in companies with under 150 employees (excluding sole traders).\n\nThe data was collected between January 31, 2025 and February 6, 2025. Censuswide abides by and employs members of the Market Research Society and follows the MRS code of conduct which is based on the ESOMAR principles.\n\n* 'Strongly agree' and 'Somewhat agree' responses combined\n\n\u2020 Sourcing products through online B2B marketplaces\n\n\u2021 'Much more important' and 'More important' responses combined\n\nAbout Alibaba.com\n\nLaunched in 1999, Alibaba.com is a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce that serves buyers and suppliers from over 200 countries and regions around the world. It is engaged in services covering various aspects of commerce, including providing businesses with tools that help them reach a global audience for their products and helping buyers discover products, find suppliers and place orders online fast and efficiently.

            "content": "One of the brilliant ideas that helped DeepSeek go viral was the Chinese company\u2019s decision to make it open-source. That meant anyone could install DeepSeek AI on their computer for free without worrying about the official DeepSeek apps for iPhone or Android.\n\nWell-known Chinese giant Alibaba is following in DeepSeek\u2019s footsteps with a different type of AI software that also happens to be very exciting. Alibaba made its text-to-video AI service called \u201cWan\u201d open-source on Wednesday. Wan competes directly against OpenAI\u2019s Sora, an impressive AI video generation tool that was first unveiled last year and released a few months ago.\n\nSpecifically, we\u2019re looking at the Wan 2.1 AI model, which will let users create videos with text, images, and even other videos in their prompts. Wan won\u2019t just challenge OpenAI\u2019s pricing model for Sora, but also OpenAI\u2019s performance. Plus, Wan will be available for free because it is open-source. And perhaps most importantly, Wan 2.1 also tops the VBench leaderboard when it comes to performance. The videos it generates are so good, it\u2019s hard to believe they were made by a free AI app.\n\nThe Wan2.1-T2V-14B AI model is currently ranked as the best-performing one. Alibaba has smaller models as well, which can be run on consumer hardware.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAccording to descriptions on the Wan website, the new AI service is capable of rendering \u201ccomplex motion,\u201d which involves creating \u201crealistic videos featuring extensive body movements, complex rotations, dynamic scene transitions, and fluid camera motions.\u201d\n\nThe website offers various examples of AI-generated videos, including a group of dogs riding bikes, two cats involved in a boxing match, and a team of dancers performing a choreography to prove this point.\n\nWan 2.1 can also generate videos that \u201caccurately simulate real-world physics and realistic object interactions.\u201d Alibaba offers additional genAI examples, including a woman splashing out of the water, an archer firing a bow, and a dog cutting tomatoes.\n\nThe text-to-video AI tool also supports \u201ccinematic quality\u201d videos, which means it should output \u201cmovie-like visuals with rich textures and a variety of stylized effects.\u201d\n\nAlso impressive are the editing claims. Apparently, Wan supports precise edits using images and video references.\n\nFinally, Wan 2.1 supports text generation in AI-generated videos. Alibaba says it is the first video model to support both Chinese and English text.\n\nThe Wan website also states that the program can generate sound effects and background music that match the visual content and the rhythm of the action.\n\nIn addition to the 14-billion model, Alibaba also released a Wan 2.1 T2V-1.3B model that needs only 8.19GB of VRAM to run. It will work with most consumer-grade GPUs and be fairly fast. \u201cIt can generate a 5-second 480P video on an RTX 4090 in about 4 minutes (without optimization techniques like quantization). Its performance is even comparable to some closed-source models,\u201d the Wan website notes.\n\nAll of that sounds great, and the video samples available at this link are also quite incredible. Wan 2.1 definitely looks like like a frontier AI video generation tool that can compete against Sora and other similar rivals that come with a cost of access.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s open source means anyone can get started with Wan 2.1 as long as they know what they\u2019re doing. Head on to Hugging Face and GitHub to start.\n\nAs you can see from the AI video examples I mentioned above, it\u2019s easy to tell some of them are AI-generated. Others might fool viewers that they\u2019re genuine clips. What I\u2019m getting at is that tools like Sora and Wan can be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nIt\u2019s great that Wan is open-source and others can inspect the code, but Alibaba\u2019s website makes no mention of safety precautions. Also, it\u2019s unclear how these sophisticated AI videos will be marked to inform users they\u2019re watching AI-generated content.\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll remind you that Alibaba isn\u2019t the only Chinese company developing an impressive AI video generation tool. A few days ago, ByteDance\u2019s OmniHuman-1 AI impressed us with its capabilities.",

            "content": "Chinese e-commerce and cloud behemoth Alibaba stock (NYSE:BABA) stock rallied by almost 8% in Thursday\u2019s trading after the company posted a better than expected set of Q3 results (fiscal year ends in March), driven by strength in its Cloud Intelligence business and core e-commerce operations. Alibaba\u2019s net income hit 48.945 billion yuan ($6.7 billion) up from the 14.43 billion yuan ($2 billion) reported in the same period of last year.\n\nImprovements In E-Commerce Business\n\nWhile China\u2019s retail market has been mixed in recent quarters due to uncertain consumer sentiment and slowing economic growth following the real estate crisis, recent data suggests a slight rebound. Chinese retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.7% year-over-year in December, driven in part by aggressive government stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and a sizable fiscal package. Over the last quarter Alibaba said its core Chinese e-commerce assets Taobao and Tmall Group posted a 5% increase in revenue to 136.1 billion yuan ($18.75 billion). In additional to the broader recover in the retail market, Alibaba has also been adjusting its strategy to compete with value-focused rivals like PDD Holdings, the owner of discount platforms such as Pinduoduo and Temu. Alibaba\u2019s cross-border e-commerce platforms, such as AliExpress, has also emerged as key growth drivers, with revenues jumping 32% to 37.8 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) in the most recent quarter. This surge is likely driven by strong performance from initiatives like the AliExpress Choice program, which offers free shipping and other benefits.\n\nGoing forward, Alibaba could benefit from its newly tweaked fee model, which replaces annual fixed service fee for vendors with a 0.6% software service fee on gross merchandise value for transactions on Tmall and Taobao. This move could boost revenue from its core customer management services following significant investments in its platforms and technology. Additionally, the company\u2019s digital marketing tool, Quanzhantui, is expected to enhance monetization for Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.\n\nAI And Cloud Growth\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cloud computing business fared well, with revenue rising 13% over the quarter, while AI-related product revenue surged by triple-digit percentage levels for the sixth quarter straight. Alibaba recently announced that it would be partnering with Apple to integrate its AI services into the iPhone in China. The Information reported that Apple also considered other Chinese AI companies including Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent before ultimately picking Alibaba, indicating confidence in the company\u2019s AI capabilities. Alibaba is also doubling down on its AI investments, noting that its spending on cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years was expected to exceed its total investments made over the past decade.\n\nOptimism surrounding China\u2019s AI sector at large has surged, following the unveiling of the DeepSeek AI model last month. DeepSeek delivers performance that is close to Open ChatGPT while using considerably less computing power. The progress in domestic AI innovation could enhance Alibaba\u2019s AI prospects, making its cloud and AI businesses more attractive to investors.\n\nNotably, BABA stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were -49% in 2021, -26% in 2022, -11% in 2023, and 12% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BABA face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2013 or will it see a recovery?\n\nPost the big rally over the past few weeks, Alibaba stock trades near $140 per share, equivalent to less than 16x projected FY\u201925 earnings. The multiple trends lower still if we exclude the company\u2019s $60 billion plus in cash. In comparison, Amazon trades at approximately 35x forward earnings.

(January 27, 2025)\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s because all of the visible AI application scenarios today that we see around content creation, search and so on and so forth have arisen precisely as a result of the ongoing extension of those boundaries, and we want to keep pushing out those boundaries to create more and more opportunities.\u201d He added.\n\nThe news of the investment comes as Apple\u2019s alleged partnership with Alibaba to roll out AI features in iPhone users in China was speculated earlier this month.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s investment in AI could lead to enhanced ecommerce experiences through personalized recommendations, improved customer service, and smarter logistics. AI can also optimize operations like inventory management and supply chains, boosting efficiency. For Alibaba Cloud, AI-powered services could attract more businesses, strengthening its competitive edge.\n\nThe company may also create new AI-driven products across industries like healthcare, finance, and entertainment, expanding its market reach. With AI becoming crucial for future growth, Alibaba\u2019s focus on this technology could help it stay competitive globally, alongside other tech giants, driving innovation and diversifying its revenue streams.\n\nMeanwhile, as reported by Bloomberg News on Monday, President Donald Trump is supposedly planning to toughen semiconductor restrictions on China, continuing and expanding the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to limit Beijing\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nREAD: Apple eager to defend Google during antitrust trial (December 26, 2024)\n\nThe U.S. semiconductor restrictions against China could significantly impact China\u2019s tech industry, limiting access to advanced semiconductor technology and slowing the development of companies like Huawei and SMIC. This could also cause supply chain disruptions, delaying the production of electronics globally.\n\nTo counter this, China may increase efforts to develop its own semiconductor capabilities, reducing reliance on foreign tech in the long run. These restrictions could shift the global semiconductor market, with countries like Taiwan and South Korea playing a larger role. Additionally, it may increase geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, fueling further competition in tech.",

The investment, which exceeds Alibaba\u2019s total AI and cloud spending over the past decade, underscores the company\u2019s focus on AI-driven growth and its role as a leading global cloud provider.\n\nDuring its latest earnings call, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu described AI as a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity, with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as the company\u2019s primary long-term objective. Wu shared that AI\u2019s ability to replicate human intellectual and physical labor could fundamentally reshape global industries, driving significant economic and technological shifts. As AI models evolve, a growing share of AI-generated data will be processed and distributed via cloud networks\u2014a trend that positions Alibaba Cloud as a key infrastructure provider.\n\nWu emphasized that cloud computing remains Alibaba\u2019s clearest revenue driver in AI, with demand for AI hosting services surging. In the latest quarter, Alibaba\u2018s Cloud Intelligence Group\u2019s revenue\u2014excluding revenue from Alibaba-consolidated subsidiaries\u2014grew 11% year-over-year, while AI-related product revenue posted triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nThe company expects AI to play an increasingly integral role across e-commerce, enterprise services, and consumer applications, enhancing efficiency, user engagement, and business innovation.\n\nIn their May 2024 shareholder letter, Chairman Joe Tsai and CEO Eddie Wu outlined Alibaba\u2019s strategic transition to a \u201cuser-first, AI-driven\u201d approach, embedding AI across its ecosystem to enhance customer experiences, optimize business operations, and fuel long-term growth.\n\nWith this investment, Alibaba is scaling up its AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure to support the next wave of technological advancements, ensuring businesses and developers have the tools to innovate and grow.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. pledged to invest more than 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) on AI infrastructure such as data centers over the next three years, a major commitment that underscores the e-commerce pioneer\u2019s ambitions of becoming a leader in artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe internet company co-founded by Jack Ma plans to spend more on its AI and cloud computing network than it has over the past decade. Alibaba envisions becoming a key partner to companies developing and applying AI to the real world as models evolve and need increasing amounts of computing power, the company said on its official blog.\n\nThat target marks one of China\u2019s biggest AI infrastructure budgets, underscoring Alibaba\u2019s growing ambitions in the field. But it comes at a time investors are pondering whether big tech firms are overestimating future demand for AI services, or the capital needed to create them.\n\nTD Cowen analysts pointed out Friday that Microsoft Corp. is canceling leases for a substantial amount of data center capacity in the US \u2014 a move that may reflect concerns about whether it\u2019s building more AI computing than it will need over the long term. Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong shares slid as much as 3% on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis also sets a record for the largest investment ever by Chinese private enterprises in the field of cloud and AI hardware infrastructure construction,\u201d Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap wrote, adding that the amount surpassed her own estimates by about 30 billion yuan.\n\nBig tech firms from Meta Platforms Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. are pledging billions toward the data centers needed to train, develop and host AI services.\n\nWall Street has begun to question whether such investment is running ahead of reality, particularly after Chinese upstart DeepSeek unveiled a model trained for a fraction of the cost of many of its rivals. But many of the industry\u2019s biggest names \u2014 including Nvidia Corp.\u2019s Jensen Huang \u2014 continue to argue that AI will simply transform the tech landscape.\n\nAlibaba certainly falls in that camp. The Chinese company is now righting a business knocked off-kilter by a government clampdown that began in 2020, refocusing its ambitions on e-commerce and AI. Last week, Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu declared that Artificial General Intelligence was now its primary objective, joining a race so far led by the likes of OpenAI and big US firms like Alphabet Inc.",

Alibaba announced the plan in a blog entry published on its news site Monday.\n\n\"The investment, which exceeds Alibaba's total AI and cloud spending over the past decade, underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth and its role as a leading global cloud provider,\" the Alibaba announcement said.\n\nOn the stock market today, U.S.-listed Alibaba stock fell more than 10% to close at 129.04.\n\nAlibaba Cloud Revenue Accelerates\n\nThe big spending plans comes as investors are scrutinizing costs related to AI, particularly after China startup DeepSeek launched a powerful AI model it said required significantly less power and computing chips to train. It also follows news that President Donald Trump ordered the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to limit Chinese investments in technology and other U.S. sectors.\n\nAlibaba said in its blog post Monday that it expects AI to \"play an increasingly integral role across e-commerce, enterprise services, and consumer applications, enhancing efficiency, user engagement, and business innovation.\"\n\nOutside of Monday's stock dip, investors have been rewarding the results of Alibaba's AI push. It is competing to provide the best AI model in China against DeepSeek as well as other China tech giants such as Baidu (BIDU) and WeChat-parent company Tencent (TCEHY).\n\nAlibaba stock jumped after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The results beat expectations for earnings and sales. Revenue from Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Group increased 13% year over year to 31.7 billion yuan (about $4.37 billion), compared to estimates of 9.8% growth.\n\nChief Executive Eddie Wu told analysts on the firm's earnings call last week that Alibaba would \"aggressively invest in AI infrastructure\" over the next three years, according to a FactSet transcript. The company said that AI-related product revenue in its cloud business grew by triple digits year over year for a sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Alibaba released an AI model it said outperforms the models of China-based rival DeepSeek. Alibaba's models are also comparable to \"top tier models,\" the company said.\n\nTwo weeks later, Alibaba stock soared on news that Apple (AAPL) will be working with Alibaba to introduce AI features to iPhones in China.\n\nAlibaba Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nEntering Monday trading, U.S.-listed Alibaba stock had rallied 70% during the first two months of the year. The gains last week placed Alibaba stock at its highest value since November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFurther, Alibaba's IBD Relative Strength Rating was 97 out of 99. The RS Rating means that BABA stock has outperformed 97% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nChina Stocks Are Hot Again: These Five Are Near Buy Points\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nHow To Research Growth Stocks: Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nNvidia Stock Pauses Despite Debut Of Blackwell.

The company said Thursday its AI-related product revenue grew by triple digits for a sixth-straight quarter in the period ended December. Its Qwen AI model has proven itself a capable rival to DeepSeek , along with winning a deal for iPhones sold in China . Founder Jack Ma, once politically sidelined, made his latest public reappearance on Feb. 17 \u2014 with a front-row seat at a rare meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping held with entrepreneurs , including DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng. Several analysts think Alibaba's gains will continue, with Jefferies setting a $156 price target as of Feb. 20. That's upside of more than 8% from Friday's close of $143.75. UBS equity strategists on Thursday said they have switched out PDD for Alibaba in a model portfolio \"given its exposure to AI and quant factors.\" Remember how just several months ago the Temu parent had a larger market cap , raising concerns that Alibaba was struggling to compete on its core e-commerce business? Taobao and Tmall Group saw sales rise 5% in the latest quarter. As excited as many investors are about AI opportunities in China, crowding into related stocks has only picked up by 0.02 so far this year on UBS's scoring system. That's far below the increase of 0.2 in the crowding score for U.S. AI-related names over the last two years, UBS said. Alibaba had the highest crowding score among large Chinese internet technology names, the report said. \"Our Quants team's analysis previously suggested that stocks with reasonable but improving crowding have seen the most near-term outperformance.\" Hong Kong's Hang Seng index hit a three-year high Friday with China Unicom, Lenovo and Alibaba's locally traded shares leading gains. \"Should investors rotate from Alibaba to the AI trade laggers (i.e. Tencent and Baidu)? Not for now,\" JPMorgan internet analyst Alex Yao wrote in a Feb. 17 note. \"We think both Tencent and Baidu's share prices could be driven by AI development in different ways with different risks.\" U.S.-listed shares of Baidu are up by about 8% for the year so far, despite the company sharing on Feb. 18 that its AI Cloud revenue rose 26% year-on-year to 7.1 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. Hong Kong-traded shares of Tencent , which has yet to report earnings for the period, have risen by about 24% for the year so far. JPMorgan is neutral on Baidu, but overweight on Tencent and Alibaba. The firm has a price target of $125 on Alibaba shares, suggesting a 13% decline from Friday's close. At least four other major investment firms have a buy rating on Alibaba. But Morgan Stanley is notably more cautious with an equal-weight rating and a price target of $100. That would imply a drop of 30% from Friday's close. The firm pointed out that Alibaba's capital expenditures were 11% of revenue in the latest quarter, versus 3% in the prior quarter \u2014 a potential weight on future margins that management warned about. Morgan Stanley also highlighted risks such as weaker consumption and a slower pace of enterprise digitalization. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

Additionally, the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group is expected to achieve profitability sooner than previously anticipated, contributing to a brighter overall earnings outlook. Consequently, these factors have led to an increase in the target price and a favorable valuation for Alibaba, reinforcing the Buy recommendation.\n\nIn another report released on February 21, Goldman Sachs also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $160.00 price target.",

            "content": "Shareholders of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 15% to US$144 following its latest third-quarter results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of CN\u00a5280b were what the analysts expected, Alibaba Group Holding surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of CN\u00a520.39 per share, an impressive 28% above what was forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding\n\nNYSE:BABA Earnings and Revenue Growth February 22nd 2025\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Alibaba Group Holding's 50 analysts is for revenues of CN\u00a51.08t in 2026. This reflects a meaningful 9.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to step up 11% to CN\u00a559.24. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of CN\u00a51.08t and earnings per share (EPS) of CN\u00a555.66 in 2026. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\n\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 22% to US$148. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Alibaba Group Holding at US$191 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$86.01. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Alibaba Group Holding is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Alibaba Group Holding's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 7.6% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 12% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.4% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Alibaba Group Holding is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "These two Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have massive potential.\n\nOnce a neglected group, Chinese tech companies have recently captured the attention of investors thanks to a series of positive developments, such as the huge government stimulus and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) services like DeepSeek.\n\nInvestors looking for companies they can invest in to benefit from the growth of AI in China have generally focused on leading tech companies like Alibaba (BABA 5.72%) and Baidu (BIDU 1.82%). But which of the two is a better choice?\n\nThe similarities between Alibaba and Baidu\n\nFounded as the first-generation tech companies in China, Alibaba and Baidu have evolved over the years to become massive tech conglomerates operating in multiple industries.\n\nThe former is an e-commerce giant, a leader in cloud computing, a major cross-border e-commerce player, a leading logistics company, and more. The latter owns China's most prominent search advertising business and other businesses in AI cloud, autonomous driving, and entertainment.\n\nTheir diversified business models provide a stable source of profit, which the tech giants can reinvest in areas with the most significant growth opportunities, such as artificial intelligence. Besides, both companies have plenty of cash on their balance sheet.\n\nIn the latest quarter's earnings, Alibaba had a $50 billion net cash position (cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and other Treasury investments less debts). Similarly, Baidu's net cash position was $11 billion. Pristine financial health is a significant advantage for both giants, since investing in AI is costly and spans years, if not decades.\n\nAlso, both companies have long invested in the cloud computing industry, owning a leading market share in the Chinese cloud market. According to Statista, Alibaba Cloud and Baidu Cloud occupy the first and third positions in China in terms of market share. Owning the cloud infrastructure provides both companies with essential computing resources to invest in leading AI technologies.\n\nMoreover, as both companies own substantial business interests in China, they face similar risk profiles in political and regulatory risks, geopolitical challenges, operational risks, and others. Investors will have little choice but to accept these risks.\n\nBoth tech giants are vastly different in many aspects\n\nDespite the similarities, the tech giants are still vastly different businesses.\n\nAlibaba generates most of its revenue from the e-commerce industry thanks to its flagship Taobao and Tmall platforms and overseas e-commerce business. In the latest quarter ended Sept. 30, 55% of Alibaba's group revenue came from these e-commerce ventures. Conversely, Baidu makes most of its income from the search advertising business (56%) and cloud computing (23%).\n\nWhile both companies have an enormous interest in AI, Alibaba predominantly employs AI to empower its existing businesses, such as using AI chatbots and AI product recommendations in its e-commerce. Similarly, AI will enhance Alibaba's other operations, such as logistics and fintech.\n\nStill, Alibaba will generate income directly from offering its AI services, predominantly in its cloud computing business. In this business, customers will pay to subscribe to Alibaba's AI products like Qwen (Alibaba's large language model), machine learning, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, Baidu has gone all-in on AI, positioning itself as an AI-first business. It uses AI extensively in its search advertising business and provides AI services in its cloud computing segment. Besides, Baidu is an early mover in the autonomous vehicle segment, applying its AI technologies to build its autonomous driving platform. As of Oct. 28, 2024, Apollo Go, Baidu's autonomous ride-hailing service, has already provided over 8 million rides to the public.\n\nAnother essential aspect is the region from which the tech giants generate their income. Alibaba has built a vast empire beyond China in its primary business segments across e-commerce, cloud computing, logistics, and fintech. On the other hand, Baidu generates almost all of its income in China, making it more susceptible to changes in the local Chinese operating environment.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nOverall, there is no clear winner. Both have enormous interests in AI and have positioned themselves to win in this AI revolution.\n\nInvestors looking for a pure AI play should consider Baidu, since it has rebranded itself as an AI company.\n\nMeanwhile, despite its significant exposure and investment in AI, Alibaba retains enormous business interest in areas like e-commerce, fintech, and more. Thus, its AI strategy will focus on providing AI products and services to its cloud computing customers and employing AI technologies to enhance its operations.\n\nInvestors should, therefore, choose the one with which they have better conviction.",

The need for more AI chips and servers to handle fast-growing usage and support model development drove its decision to consider outside funding, the report said.\n\nChina Investment Corp and the National Social Security Fund have contacted DeepSeek for investment, the report said. The funds could not be immediately reached, while Alibaba and DeepSeek did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nExecutives at the Chinese AI firm and its hedge fund parent, High-Flyer Capital Management, are also talking about shifting its focus to building a business that generates revenue and eventually profit from research, the report said.\n\nRival OpenAI is planning to revamp its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation to ease the restrictions imposed by its current non-profit parent and increase investments.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping had recently met with private sector business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, to bolster the country's economy and advance its technological capabilities.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",

The S&P 500 lost over 1.5% and bonds rallied. A notional $2.7 trillion of options tied to equities and ETFs was set to expire. That usually amplifies price swings. Also contributing to the volatility was a rally in Covid-19 vaccine makers as traders shared earlier reports about a new coronavirus study in China.\n\nTo Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services, you put all those factors together when you have a stock market that\u2019s so \u201crichly valued\u201d, and it\u2019s enough for \u201ca little bit of a shakeout.\u201d At AlphaSimplex Group, Katy Kaminski says it just seems to be a \u201cclassic risk-off type of day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this the start of the correction?\u201d said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities, in a note titled \u201cWeaker Economic Outlook Trumps Inflation Fears.\u201d \u201cAdd in three people have sent us a new bat virus story. Does anyone want to go into the weekend short Treasuries?\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.7%. The Nasdaq 100 slid 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7%. Economically sensitive corners of the market like transportation companies and small caps got hardly hit. A gauge of the Magnificent Seven megacaps lost 2.5%.\n\nA rally in Treasuries pushed the yield on 10-year notes lower for a sixth-straight week as traders sought safety. The benchmark yield fell eight basis points to 4.43% Friday. A dollar gauge rose 0.3%.\n\n\u201cOptions expiration could be adding to some of the volatility from the weaker economic data,\u201d said Larry Tentarelli at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. \u201cWe do not think that investors should overreact to one set of data points, especially with the S&P 500 just coming off of new highs this week.\u201d\n\nHowever, if we see a series of softer-than-forecast economic data points, that would raise more of a red flag, he added.\n\n\u201cWith policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\u201d said Gina Bolvin at Bolvin Wealth Management Group. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a strong foundation in place for the bull market to continue.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

We will aggressively invest in AI infrastructure. Our planned investment in cloud and AI infrastructure over the next three years is set to exceed what we have spent over the past decade,\" said Wu.\n\nHe later added that he expects this to be the \"single period in which we'll be making the most concentrated and highest level of investments in building out our cloud and AI-related infrastructure,\" while noting that hardware infrastructure will have an impact in terms of depreciation.\n\nAn exact number for AI and cloud infrastructure capex was not shared, but Wu told analysts that they expect it to be fairly equally split between the three years, with some fluctuation on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n\nThe Chinese company's cloud segment saw a strong quarter, with revenue growth of 13 percent year-over-year (YoY) to $4.349 billion, while AI-related product revenue achieved triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. For comparison, the previous quarter saw revenue growth of seven percent YoY.\n\nCloud-adjusted EBITDA increased by 33 percent YoY, which Alibaba's CFO Toby Xu put down to a shift in \"product mix to higher-margin public cloud products and improving operating efficiency, partly offset by the increasing investments in customer growth and technology.\"\n\nOn the demand for AI technology, Wu added that since the Chinese New Year, the company has seen that around 60-70 percent of new demand is for inference workloads. \"We expect that with this rapid expansion in demand [for inference], we will grow our customer base and expand industry coverage across a wider range of sectors and all of that will certainly contribute to higher levels of margin in our AI services,\" he said.\n\nThis shift towards inferencing was predicted by Wu during the previous quarter's earnings call, in which he noted that currently, they were seeing demand for training but expected this to move to inferencing with a \"smaller number of companies that are actually doing model training.\"\n\nThis month has already seen Alibaba expand its data center footprint globally, launching its first cloud region in Mexico, in addition to a second data center in Thailand. Plans for both of those expansions were first shared in May 2024, along with a commitment to add more data centers in Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea.\n\nIn September 2024, there was a fire at a Digital Realty data center in Singapore which was used by Alibaba Cloud for availability zone C of its Singapore region. The fire was contained, and Alibaba restored some of the hardware damaged which included \"carefully drying\" servers.",

The headline inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 34 straight months.\n\nAlibaba shares pop on cloud growth\n\nAlibaba shot up 8.1% in U.S. on Thursday and jumped as much as 12% in Hong Kong on Friday. The Chinese tech giant on Thursday reported net income of 48.945 billion yuan ($6.72 billion) in the December quarter, a 239% surge from a year ago. Alibaba's top line was also better than expected, lifted by 13% year-on-year sales growth in its Cloud Intelligence Group during the quarter. Separately, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen increased his personal stake in Alibaba to around $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nAmazon's quarterly revenue beats Walmart's\n\nAmazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter \u2014 above the $180.5 billion reported by Walmart on Thursday. Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.\n\nTaking Thames private\n\nPrivate equity investor KKR is offering about \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) for U.K.'s struggling Thames Water utility, according to a person familiar with the matter. The water utility firm is saddled with ballooning debt and has warned it will run out of cash by March 24. KKR's involvement would comprise a \u00a34 billion management-buyout submission that would not result in the sale of assets or a breakup of the utility, the source said.\n\n[PRO] Behind Thursday's sell-off\n\nWalmart, as the U.S.' largest retailer and generator of revenue, serves as a bellwether for consumer health. So when the company said it expects profit growth to slow this fiscal year, investors took notice and sold off shares. Here's what analysts think of the dip in markets on Thursday.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nYuri Kadobnov | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMoscow loathed the U.S. for years as its economy paid a high price for war \u2014 now, it's doing a U-turn\n\nSince invading Ukraine three years ago, Russia has spent a significant amount of energy demonizing the U.S. and denigrating the country. But the arrival of a friendlier administration under U.S. President Donald Trump, which kickstarted fledgling talks to end the conflict in Ukraine \u2014 as well as a way in from the economic and geopolitical cold \u2014 are prompting a softening of the Kremlin's adversarial stance.\n\nAs tensions between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spilled into open acrimony on Wednesday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" Putin praised Trump for showing restraint amid what he described as \"hysteria\" by European leaders who are angry at being left out of negotiations on Ukraine's future.",

Sentiment towards the stock also received a lift recently after co-founder Jack Ma attended a meeting earlier this week with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, indicating improved dialog between the pair.\n\nThe stock rose 8% to near $136 on Thursday, closing at its highest level since November 2021.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Alibaba\u2019s weekly chart and identify key post-earnings price levels worth watching out for.\n\nAccelerating Buying Momentum\n\nSince undergoing a retracement to the top trendline of a broad symmetrical triangle, Alibaba shares have trended sharply higher, with the price recently climbing back above the closely watched 200-period moving average (MA).\n\nImportantly, the rally has occurred on above-average trading volume, signaling buying conviction from larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds.\n\nWhile the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions in the stock, increasing the likelihood of short-term profit-taking.\n\nLet\u2019s identify key support and resistance levels on Alibaba\u2019s chart that investors may be watching.\n\nKey Support Levels to Watch\n\nAn initial wave of profit-taking could bring the $103 level into play. The shares may find support in this area near the 200-period MA, which closely aligns with the April and July 2023 peaks.\n\nA close below this location could see the shares revisit the $78 level. This area, currently positioned near the symmetrical triangle\u2019s top trendline, may provide support near a range of similar price points on the chart stretching back to March 2022.\n\nImportant Resistance Levels to Monitor\n\nIf the stock continues to track higher, investors should initially monitor how the price responds to the $178 level. The shares may run into resistance in this region near the September and October 2021 countertrend peaks that formed during a prolonged downtrend throughout 2021 and 2022.\n\nFinally, buying above this level could fuel a rally to around $231. Investors may seek to lock in profits in this area near a trendline that links the prominent January 2020 swing high with a series of comparable trading levels on the chart over a twelve-month period between June that same year and June 2021.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The company\u2019s stock soared following the report, which showed revenues up 8% year over year.\n\n\u201cWe aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence. Why is that the primary aim?\u201d Eddie Wu, the company\u2019s CEO, said during the earnings call. \u201cWell, it\u2019s because all of the visible AI application scenarios today that we see around content creation, search and so on and so forth have arisen precisely as a result of the ongoing extension of those boundaries, and we want to keep pushing out those boundaries to create more and more opportunities.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, he added, pursuing AGI can contribute to business value, noting studies which have shown that the standard for AGI is artificial intelligence that can replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities.\n\n\u201cWell, around 50% of global GDP is manpower salaries, including both intellectual or mental work and physical labor,\u201d Wu said.\u201dSo if AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of restructuring industry around the world and could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP.\u201d\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, most of the world\u2019s biggest tech players have made developing AGI a goal, including OpenAI, Google and Meta.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman \u201cfanned the flames\u201d \u2014 as that report said \u2014 at the start of the year when he wrote on his personal blog that the company is \u201cnow confident we know how to build AGI\u201d as the technology has been traditionally understood.\n\n\u201cAchieving AGI would have big implications for business. For example, one AI system can analyze market trends while simultaneously redesigning the supply chain to adapt to those changes,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cIt can handle customer service while using those interactions to inform product development. It can manage operations while developing innovative solutions to efficiency problems. It can make strategic decisions by synthesizing information across multiple industries and domains, which requires high-level general reasoning.\u201d\n\nAlibaba\u2019s earnings come on the heels of the news that the company was working with Apple to help that company launch the latest AI-powered version of the iPhone in China.",

Also, what are the expected CapEx investments over the next three years? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: Alibaba is well-positioned in AI, especially in Asia, with leading cloud infrastructure and AI models. We aim to pursue AGI, which could significantly impact global GDP. We plan to invest more in AI and cloud infrastructure over the next three years than in the past decade. CapEx will be relatively even annually, but may fluctuate quarterly. This investment will impact profitability, but we expect rapid demand uptake to offset this.\n\nQ: How does Alibaba view the monetization of AI and cloud, especially with the introduction of high-quality, cost-efficient models like DeepSeek? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: The AI landscape is still evolving, and future monetization models are not yet clear. However, cloud computing remains a clear monetization pathway as all AI models need hosting. Within Alibaba, AI applications in Taobao, Quark, and DingTalk are expected to enhance user engagement and efficiency.\n\nQ: What are the key initiatives for Alibaba's domestic and international e-commerce businesses, and how do you see their profitability trends? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: For domestic e-commerce, we focus on enhancing user experience and stabilizing market share. Internationally, we aim for stable growth and profitability, with clear pathways to profitability in our B2C business. Collaborations with local platforms are also enhancing profitability.\n\nQ: With AI-related revenue growing at triple digits, how does this impact cloud margins, and how does Alibaba's cloud business compare to global peers? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: AI-related revenues have seen triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters, driven by high demand for inference. While CapEx investments will impact margins, the scale effects of cloud computing will help optimize costs. However, margins in China may differ from international markets due to competitive dynamics.\n\nQ: How does Alibaba plan to deploy its remaining share buyback funds, and what is the strategy for enhancing shareholder returns? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: We have made significant progress with share repurchases, achieving a 5% net reduction in share count over nine months. We will continue to optimize capital allocation to enhance shareholder returns through dividends, buybacks, and investments in high-growth areas.\n\nQ: What is Alibaba's strategy for AI applications on the enterprise side, and how will CapEx be allocated, especially concerning chip investments? A: Yongming Wu, CEO: AI will drive enterprise software to become more AI agent-driven, with opportunities in SaaS and supporting layers. Our cloud is designed to be compatible with various chips, ensuring policy changes won't affect our investment plans.\n\nQ: Following the divestment of Sun Art and Intime, are there plans for further asset divestments, and how will Alibaba monetize its AI models? A: Xu Hong, CFO: We will continue to exit noncore businesses while focusing on core operations. Freshippo, for example, is not for sale, but we are open to strategic investments to enhance its value. Yongming Wu, CEO: Our Qwen model is open-source but not free, and we charge for API access. As models improve, we may charge more, and cross-selling opportunities will drive cloud revenue.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

That\u2019s come even as the company faces concerns over the impact of fierce competition and China\u2019s struggling economy.\n\nOptions traders are predicting a bigger-than-usual stock reaction to the results. Shares have shot past analyst price targets, trading at technically overheated levels and at the highest earnings multiple in two years.\n\n\u201cFundamentals will have to be back in focus\u201d to drive further gains in the stock, HSBC Holdings PLC analyst Charlene Liu wrote in a note. This includes e-commerce market share stabilization as well as \u201ca clear strategy to monetize AI and accelerate cloud revenue growth and margin improvement.\u201d\n\nAlibaba shares fell as much as 4% in early trading Thursday, ahead of its earnings report.\n\nThe DeepSeek frenzy has raised expectations that accelerating AI adoption will boost demand for Alibaba Cloud\u2019s market-leading services. The stock is trading at about 13 times estimated forward earnings, up from less than 9 times just last month.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s valuation could return to its five-year average of 15 times \u201cif its AI story continues to unfold,\u201d said Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. The rally faces challenges, however, including the level of stimulus announced at upcoming government meetings and the start of US tariffs, he said.\n\nThe bar to impress the market this earnings season looks high, judging from the negative reaction to Baidu Inc.\u2019s results this week. The shares slid as investors focused on weakness in its core search business despite strong momentum in its AI cloud business.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s results will be parsed for clues on its success in capitalizing on AI demand, while sheltering its earnings from the impact of price competition with rival hyperscalers and e-commerce players.\n\nAnalysts estimate sales rose 6.5% in the three months through December, up more than a full percentage point versus both the previous quarter and year-ago period. The consensus expects a net adjusted profit margin of 16.6%, up from 13.2% for the September-ended quarter.\n\nStory Continues",

International retail sales jumped in Alibaba's September-ended quarter while consumer spending in China remains sluggish.\n\nAnalysts with JPMorgan, who hold a positive overweight call on Alibaba stock, said in a recent client note that they expect improved gross merchandise volume growth compared to Alibaba's September quarter, based on the company describing a strong Singles Day sales performance in November.\n\nAlibaba Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nAlibaba stock broke out of a cup-with-handle pattern on Feb. 7, above a 103.67 buy point, according to MarketSurge. Shares reached a high of 129.02 Tuesday, Alibaba's highest level since February 2022.\n\nShares of the Chinese tech giant rocketed higher last fall after the Chinese government said it would take steps to stimulate economic growth. But enthusiasm about the efforts waned late in the year, with Alibaba stock ending with a modest 10% gain overall gain for 2024.\n\nBut shares have steadily gained this year.

Alibaba, Ma\u2019s company, remains a potent symbol of China\u2019s private sector success. But the company itself has changed from a retail giant to a pillar of China\u2019s artificial intelligence and cloud computing ambitions, and its commercial dominance now takes a back seat to its strategic value to Beijing.\n\nThis convergence of economic necessity and industrial policy signals a broader shift. Private enterprise is again essential\u2014but only within boundaries set by the state. Alibaba\u2019s cloud infrastructure has become central to China\u2019s push for self-sufficiency, tethering its future even more closely to national priorities.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting this week with top CEOs sought to repair some of the damage done by previous policies. Over the past year, opaque and abrupt detentions of business leaders had made success a liability, stoking anxiety in the private sector. Many of these detentions appeared less about clear legal violations than cash-strapped local governments using fines and seizures for revenue.\n\nIn 2024 alone, executives from more than 80 listed companies were detained, often by authorities from regions unrelated to their businesses\u2014a practice dubbed \u201clong-range fishing\u201d by Chinese media. This uncertainty has cast a shadow over economic recovery, diverting business leaders from innovation and growth to self-preservation.\n\nRecognizing the risks, Premier Li Qiang has called for stronger oversight, signaling an effort to curb these detentions and reassure the private sector. However, with enforcement still opaque and the broader regulatory environment in flux, concerns over arbitrary crackdowns remain deeply embedded in China\u2019s business landscape.\n\nBy convening China\u2019s top entrepreneurs, Beijing sought to not only reassure the private sector but also draw a line under years of unpredictable crackdowns, signaling that the private sector remains indispensable.\n\nThis marks a tactical shift. Beijing still dictates the terms, but it now recognizes that a private sector paralyzed by fear serves no one. The era of unchecked ambition for China\u2019s business leaders may be over, but so too, perhaps, is the era of indiscriminate punishment for those aligned with state priorities.\n\nAlibaba has, in turn, been refitting itself to match those priorities and place itself at the heart of Beijing\u2019s technological ambitions. Founded in 1999 by Ma, Alibaba began as an e-commerce platform but rapidly expanded into digital payments, logistics, and cloud computing. Today, it is one of China\u2019s most influential private sector companies, operating at the intersection of commerce, finance, and technology. Like all major Chinese firms, it has always navigated a delicate balance between business ambitions and state priorities\u2014negotiating the shifting boundaries of what is permissible and what is politically necessary.\n\nFor years, Alibaba was viewed primarily as an e-commerce giant, its AI and cloud investments overshadowed by its retail dominance. That perception is changing. DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthroughs have forced a reassessment of China\u2019s capabilities, and Alibaba is emerging as the country\u2019s best bet for scaling AI infrastructure.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud division, China\u2019s largest, is uniquely positioned to support AI deployment across industries, from finance and health care to manufacturing and logistics. As U.S. export controls tighten, domestic computing power is becoming just as crucial as AI research itself.\n\nMarkets have responded accordingly. On Feb. 13, shortly before Reuters broke news of the upcoming meeting, Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares surged to a three-year high, adding more than 600 billion Hong Kong dollars (about $77 billion) to its market cap this year alone. The Hang Seng Tech Index reached its highest level since early 2022.\n\nBy Feb. 17, as Xi convened the meeting, Chinese stocks surged again on policy-driven optimism but showed signs of fragility. Investors, eager for concrete commitments, engaged in profit-taking, reflecting uncertainty over the depth of government support. Tencent soared to a four-year high after integrating DeepSeek\u2019s AI model R1 into WeChat, solidifying AI\u2019s growing influence.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed to its highest level since 2022, while Hang Seng Tech officially entered a bull market. DeepSeek\u2019s breakthroughs fueled gains across AI-related sectors, particularly in health care and robotics. Meanwhile, China\u2019s 30-year bond futures declined as capital rotated into equities, signaling renewed confidence in policy direction.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s role in this shift cannot be overstated. DeepSeek has proved that Chinese AI models can compete with Silicon Valley\u2019s, but Alibaba owns the infrastructure necessary to scale those capabilities. Without robust cloud computing, AI research will rapidly hit a ceiling, and Alibaba\u2019s dominance in that space makes it indispensable to Beijing\u2019s long-term vision.\n\nThis shift was further cemented by its partnership with Apple, which has reportedly selected Alibaba as its AI partner for the Chinese market. For Apple, the partnership is a regulatory necessity, ensuring compliance while integrating AI capabilities into its devices. For Alibaba, it is a validation of its AI leadership and a strategic expansion into consumer-facing AI applications. In a time when foreign tech companies face increasing scrutiny in China, Alibaba is emerging as a bridge between global AI development and the domestic market.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Ma\u2019s return takes on a different meaning. His sidelining in 2020 was not just about financial regulations\u2014it was a broader political statement that no private entrepreneur, however influential, could operate beyond the state\u2019s reach. His reappearance now does not signal a reversal but a tactical recalibration. With economic recovery still uneven and foreign investment hesitant, Beijing appears to recognize that private sector dynamism remains crucial and that Alibaba is uniquely positioned to use AI and adjacent industries as levers for growth.\n\nYet, while investor sentiment has turned sharply positive, the long-term policy environment remains unpredictable. China has a history of oscillating between supporting and restraining its private sector. The government\u2019s priority is not just to foster innovation but to ensure that corporate power remains aligned with state interests. If Alibaba\u2019s influence in AI and cloud computing is perceived as drifting too far from that alignment, policy could shift again just as quickly as it has turned favorable.\n\nThat is why Ma\u2019s return, though symbolically important, is unlikely to herald a return to his past prominence. He appears to have absorbed the lessons of the past few years, adopting a more measured presence, staying behind the scenes while others take the reins. Unlike before, when he was Alibaba\u2019s most vocal champion and even criticized regulators, Ma is now taking a strategically quiet approach.\n\nFor now, Alibaba finds itself aligned with Beijing\u2019s ambitions. How long that alignment holds will depend on how well it navigates an environment where being rich and useful to the economy is tolerated\u2014until it isn\u2019t. The line between being an indispensable economic asset and a challenge to state authority remains thin, and in China, the ultimate decision on which entrepreneurs are welcomed and which are sidelined\u2014or worse\u2014rests with Xi.",

Alibaba stock has surged more than 74% over the past year, driven by optimism about its cloud computing division, AliCloud, the growth of its domestic e-commerce market, and its expanding presence in the AI sector. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2.67 per share, representing a 2.7% increase year-over-year.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nMeanwhile, revenues are expected to grow by 6% from the year-ago quarter to $38.20 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page. Notably, Alibaba missed EPS estimates only twice out of the last nine quarters.\n\nRecent Event Ahead of Q3 Print\n\nJust last week, Alibaba stock gained momentum after securing a deal with Apple (AAPL). As part of its AI agreement, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 model will be integrated into iPhones sold in China, enhancing key features such as voice recognition, content recommendations, and photo editing for Chinese users.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views on BABA Ahead of Q3 Results\n\nAhead of Alibaba\u2019s Q3 results, analysts remain optimistic about the company\u2019s AI potential. One such analyst is Alex Yao of JPMorgan, who gave a Buy rating on the stock along with a $125 price target. He said that Alibaba remains his \u201cfavorite stock in the China internet space.\u201d\n\nYao highlighted that Alibaba\u2019s stock has surged 23% since January 29, following the launch of its latest large language model, Qwen 2.5, significantly outperforming the MSCI China Index. He believes that the stock could see further upside due to the growing cloud revenue with increasing AI adoption and improving China\u2019s e-commerce profits.\n\nSimilarly, Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong is also bullish on Alibaba Cloud and growing AI demand. He notes that Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model powers leading open-source AI models, and its latest Qwen 2.5-Max MoE model outperforms competitors in key benchmarks. Additionally, he sees Alibaba\u2019s cloud infrastructure gaining momentum in the enterprise sector. Based on these factors, Chong raised his price target to $150 while keeping a Buy rating.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate a Large Move\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry, the Options tool does this for you.\n\nIndeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting an 8.94% move in either direction.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on BABA stock based on seven Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. The average BABA stock price target is $129.13, implying an upside potential of 3.53%.\n\nSee more BABA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

He has kept a low profile with few public appearances in recent years after he publicly criticized China\u2019s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai.\n\nOther business leaders at Monday\u2019s meeting in Beijing were Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of battery developer CATL, Wang Chuanfu, chairman of electric cars manufacturer BYD, and Pony Ma, the CEO of Tencent, which owns WeChat, according to a video of the meeting from state broadcaster CCTV and a state media report.\n\nXi said he hoped private businesses will continue to \u201cget rich first, and then promote common prosperity,\u201d a reference to a program to encourage development and close the wealth gap. Alibaba previously pledged $15.5 billion to the cause, while Tencent pledged $7.7 billion.\n\nEarlier on Monday, a two-paragraph report about the meeting which originally had been carried by state media was subsequently deleted. Instead, a search online revealed a shorter state media statement which had cut out the names of those present.\n\nA later readout of the meeting carried Xi\u2019s speech, and mentioned the names of some of those present, but not Ma.\n\nMa, one of the wealthiest men in the country, gave a speech in Oct 2020 in which he said regulators were too conservative. The government responded by scuttling his plans for Ant Group \u2018s stock market debut. The finance-focused business grew out of Alipay, the popular digital payments system. It then forced Ant Group to restructure, dividing it into multiple independent businesses.\n\nAlibaba was also investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules.\n\n\u2014-\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.",

He has called on private companies to follow his theme of \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d in which they should share the fruits of their success with the people. This has led to a cooling down in the ambition and confidence of private firms with Ma largely withdrawing from public life after he faced severe criticism for a speech in 2020 where he blasted state regulators.\n\nHowever, it seems that Xi, responding to U.S. advancements in AI technology, the state of the Chinese economy and tariffs pressure from President Trump has changed course.\n\nXi Promises to Remove \u201cObstacles\u201d\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s meeting, which also saw invites to Tencent\u2019s (TCEHY) boss Pony Ma, BYD\u2019s (BYDDY) Wang Chuanfu, Meituan\u2019s Wang Xing, Xiaomi Corp chief Lei Jun, Wang Xingxing of robotics startup Unitree, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, and Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xi urged the leaders to \u201cmaintain their competitive spirit.\u201d As reported by Reuters Xi said the tech titans should have confidence in the country\u2019s future stating that the challenges they faced were \u201ctemporary.\u201d He promised to abolish unreasonable fees or fines against private firms and level the competitive playing field with state-owned firms. Indeed, yesterday China\u2019s parliament said it would review laws centered on promoting the private economy.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to resolutely remove all kinds of obstacles to the equal use of production factors and fair participation in market competition,\u201d Xi told the entrepreneurs. \u201cBeijing should continue to make great efforts to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for private enterprises.\u201d Although unlikely to let private firms have the freedom they enjoyed pre-2020, more state support would be a positive boost to their investment plans and signal an increased challenge to U.S. rivals.\n\nIs BABA a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOn TipRanks, BABA has a Strong Buy consensus based on 7 Buy and 1 Hold rating.

State media did not report any remarks by Ma, AFP reported.State media footage showed that the participants also included Tencent chief Pony Ma and Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence firm whose chatbot has caused a global stir in recent weeks.Alibaba founder's absence from public view in the fag end of 2020 fueled social media speculation over his whereabouts at a time when Chinese regulatory reportedly authorized a clampdown on his sprawling business empire.In October 2020, Ma, the China's highest-profile entrepreneur, blasted China's regulatory system in a speech at a forum in Shanghai. Subsequently, there was the suspension of a $37 billion IPO of Alibaba's Ant Group fintech arm.In April 2024, Ma was once again back in the public forum as he lauded Alibaba's transformation.Meanwhile, Chinese business luminaries lined up to express confidence in the country's embattled private sector following rare talks with President Jinping this week, state media reported Tuesday.State news agency Xinhua reported that the Chinese leader said the problems facing private firms were 'surmountable'.China is battling slowing economic growth amid a real-estate crisis, persistently low consumption and high youth unemployment. State media broadcast a procession of business luminaries at the meeting proclaiming their faith in the future of the private economy, as per an AFP report.Beijing has rolled out a slew of policies to create jobs and get people to spend more in order to boost growth, but they have had a limited effect so far.President Xi portrayed private sector challenges as a result of reform and industrial transformation but said they were temporary and \"surmountable rather than unsolvable\".The President urged attendees on Monday to \"unify thought and action\" around the ruling Communist Party's economic policies, \"see the prospects, see the light, and see the future\".A1.

            "content": "It has become clear to investors who know what to look for that value stocks are about to be the end game for 2025, especially considering all of the volatility breakouts that have come up over the past couple of weeks. These range from economic data surprises like inflation to new trade tariff announcements from President Trump and just broader rotations inside the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indexes.\n\nWith this in mind, investors typically go into two places during volatile times like these: value stocks or consumer staples names for their safety and low volatility. Today, investors should go deeper than defensive names since this time around, the risk-to-reward looks fantastic for undervalued stocks that still carry enough fundamental reasons to get them to higher prices ahead.\n\nGet Advanced Micro Devices alerts: Sign Up\n\nNames like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD, a chipmaker who has missed out on most of the artificial intelligence run in the technology sector, or energy drink maker Celsius Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CELH, and even Chinese commerce and technology giant Alibaba Group NYSE: BABA all carry these same characteristics of having priced in some of the worst-case scenarios, leaving nothing but upside for savvy value investors.\n\nWhy Investors Might Consider Advanced Micro Devices Stock\u2019s Recent Dip\n\nAfter reporting earnings on the first week of February 2025, shares of Advanced Micro Devices shed over 8% in value overnight, a response from the market that left most investors wondering whether it was truly justified. The reason is that, despite this sell-off, the company actually reported good figures and growth across the board.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$155.83\n\n40.59% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 32 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $250.00 Average Forecast $155.83 Low Forecast $110.00 Advanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Details\n\nThe problem is that this growth seems very small and bearish next to the bloated projections and performance that investors have gotten used to coming from other names like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA. So even a great quarter for Advanced Micro Devices is still seen as a relatively negative thing next to figures coming from peers.\n\nWith this in mind, investors can start to see how this is a matter of perception and potential greed, which is why the current $158.7 consensus price target on Advanced Micro Devices stock matters all the more today, one that calls for up to 44% upside from where it trades today.\n\nAnother form of support investors can find when considering a potential buy in this name is the fact that institutional buyers from the Vanguard Group decided to boost their holdings in Advanced Micro Devices stock by 1% as of February 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it brought their position up to $18.1 billion.\n\nThe Worst Is in the Past for Celsius Stock\n\nAfter a grueling 20% decline over the past month alone, it is safe for investors to assume that the worst for Celsius stock might be behind it. The reason is that, now that Celsius trades at a forward P/E ratio of only 25.2x, it is the lowest valuation the company has seen in its history since being public.\n\nCelsius Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$47.67\n\n46.13% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 18 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $95.00 Average Forecast $47.67 Low Forecast $26.00 Celsius Stock Forecast Details\n\nMore than that, as the stock reached a low of only 22% of its 52-week high, there is nothing but upside to be had in this stock from here. This is the one theme that Wall Street analysts are focused on today when publishing their ratings for Celsius.\n\nAs of February 2025, the consensus valuation for Celsius is $47.6 per share, calling for up to 123% upside from today\u2019s low price. As bullish as this may seem, however, it doesn\u2019t even get close to the stock\u2019s 52-week high of $99 per share. This way, investors can see just how high the ceiling is for the company compared to the potential downside.\n\nThis view would also explain why Vanguard decided to plunge into this stock, adding 2.2% to its holdings as of February 2025, bringing its net position to a high of $416.5 million today, or 6.7% ownership in the company.\n\nAlibaba: The Most Important Stock in China\n\nThat\u2019s Alibaba, and while it has already reached a new 52-week high, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the ceiling is much higher than today\u2019s prices. One reason is the strong investor confidence in this company, with both David Tepper and Michael Burry making it the largest holding in their portfolios.\n\nAlibaba Group Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$131.93\n\n-8.17% Downside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 14 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $190.00 Average Forecast $131.93 Low Forecast $85.00 Alibaba Group Stock Forecast Details\n\nMore than that, Chinese technology stocks, measured by the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF NYSE: KWEB, have severely underperformed American technology stocks, leaving investors with a wide gap to be filled in terms of performance and valuations.\n\nUltimately, investors can gauge just how bullish the tailwinds behind Alibaba are by looking at the $25 billion stock buyback program approved and implemented by management. If insiders are this optimistic about the company\u2019s future, enough to buy back over 10% of its market capitalization, then there\u2019s got to be a strong reason why.\n\nKnowing that the all-time highs for Alibaba are over $300 per share, today\u2019s price seems minuscule compared to how much upside there\u2019s really left in the stock, despite recent rallies to new 52-week highs.\n\nBefore you consider Advanced Micro Devices, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices currently has a \"Moderate Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Alibaba stock has surged more than 74% over the past year, driven by optimism about its cloud computing division, AliCloud, the growth of its domestic e-commerce market, and its expanding presence in the AI sector. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2.67 per share, representing a 2.7% increase year-over-year.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nMeanwhile, revenues are expected to grow by 6% from the year-ago quarter to $38.20 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page. Notably, Alibaba missed EPS estimates only twice out of the last nine quarters.\n\nRecent Event Ahead of Q3 Print\n\nJust last week, Alibaba stock gained momentum after securing a deal with Apple (AAPL). As part of its AI agreement, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 model will be integrated into iPhones sold in China, enhancing key features such as voice recognition, content recommendations, and photo editing for Chinese users.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views on BABA Ahead of Q3 Results\n\nAhead of Alibaba\u2019s Q3 results, analysts remain optimistic about the company\u2019s AI potential. One such analyst is Alex Yao of JPMorgan, who gave a Buy rating on the stock along with a $125 price target. He said that Alibaba remains his \u201cfavorite stock in the China internet space.\u201d\n\nYao highlighted that Alibaba\u2019s stock has surged 23% since January 29, following the launch of its latest large language model, Qwen 2.5, significantly outperforming the MSCI China Index. He believes that the stock could see further upside due to the growing cloud revenue with increasing AI adoption and improving China\u2019s e-commerce profits.\n\nSimilarly, Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong is also bullish on Alibaba Cloud and growing AI demand. He notes that Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model powers leading open-source AI models, and its latest Qwen 2.5-Max MoE model outperforms competitors in key benchmarks. Additionally, he sees Alibaba\u2019s cloud infrastructure gaining momentum in the enterprise sector. Based on these factors, Chong raised his price target to $150 while keeping a Buy rating.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate a Large Move\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry, the Options tool does this for you.\n\nIndeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting an 8.94% move in either direction.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on BABA stock based on seven Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. The average BABA stock price target is $129.13, implying an upside potential of 3.53%.\n\nSee more BABA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s President Xi Jinping met with private sector business leaders on Monday, offering them assurances that policies regarding the private sector would not change, state media reported, as government officials work to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns and a real estate crisis.\n\nAmong those present was Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who was part of a focus on a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years.\n\nXi told the audience that the Communist Party and the government\u2019s approach towards the private sector has been incorporated into \u201cthe socialist system with Chinese characteristics,\u201d which is how the party describes its governance, according to state broadcaster CCTV. \u201cThey cannot and will not change,\u201d said Xi.\n\nThe president also said the government would \u201csincerely protect the legal rights of private businesses and entrepreneurs, according to the law.\u201d But, \u201cat the same time, we must realize that our country is a socialist country ruled by law, and any type of illegal activities by enterprises cannot avoid investigation and punishment.\u201d\n\nThe words of assurance were made after Beijing launched a crackdown on the tech sector in 2020 to break down monopolies and implement strict data regulations.\n\nOne of the most public faces of that crackdown was Ma, who founded e-commerce firm Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China\u2019s richest man. He has kept a low profile with few public appearances in recent years after he publicly criticized China\u2019s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai.\n\nOther business leaders at Monday\u2019s meeting in Beijing were Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of battery developer CATL, Wang Chuanfu, chairman of electric cars manufacturer BYD, and Pony Ma, the CEO of Tencent, which owns WeChat, according to a video of the meeting from state broadcaster CCTV and a state media report.\n\nXi said he hoped private businesses will continue to \u201cget rich first, and then promote common prosperity,\u201d a reference to a program to encourage development and close the wealth gap. Alibaba previously pledged $15.5 billion to the cause, while Tencent pledged $7.7 billion.\n\nEarlier on Monday, a two-paragraph report about the meeting which originally had been carried by state media was subsequently deleted. Instead, a search online revealed a shorter state media statement which had cut out the names of those present.\n\nA later readout of the meeting carried Xi\u2019s speech, and mentioned the names of some of those present, but not Ma.\n\nMa, one of the wealthiest men in the country, gave a speech in Oct 2020 in which he said regulators were too conservative. The government responded by scuttling his plans for Ant Group \u2018s stock market debut. The finance-focused business grew out of Alipay, the popular digital payments system. It then forced Ant Group to restructure, dividing it into multiple independent businesses.\n\nAlibaba was also investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules.\n\n\u2014-\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.",

Alibaba\u2019s shares are up 30% this year, as it embraces a new identity as an \u201cAI darling.\u201d\n\nPerhaps to offset that reputation blow, Baidu announced its own moves last week:\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy of my enemy is my friend as Tencent brought DeepSeek AI features into its Weixin (WeChat) messaging app. Initially this is just a test phase that will let some users use the AI service for search but there could be more Weixin features, and Tencent may use DeepSeek tech in its other products, including cloud services, and its assistant app.\n\nCoinbase plans to re-enter India\n\nThe US is radically rethinking crypto under the Trump administration and Coinbase, the biggest name in the industry and a US tech giant, is re-evaluating the Indian market.\n\nCoinbase left India over a year ago due to the regulatory challenges of the market, but now some of that burden has lessened hence the US giant is in talks with regulators to see what can be done. Binance returned to India last year and Coinbase has traditionally been far more compliant, a requirement for a US-listed business.\n\nNews of Coinbase\u2019s interest in India comes weeks after India\u2019s Economic Affairs Secretary said the government will reassess how it regulates crypto given the shift from the US government and other countries.\n\neFishery lays off 90% of staff\n\nDisgraced startup eFishery is cutting over 1,000 jobs (that\u2019s around 90% of its workforce) after investigating allegations of fraudulent accounting. We wrote last week that the findings of an internal report had become public, and the company could still face liquidation as it bids to recover.\n\nChinese stocks bullish in contrast to US slump after DeepSeek\u2019s emergence\n\nUS public markets may have been shattered by DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough but Chinese tech stocks are, by contrast, in a bull market phase, the FT reports:\n\nThe Hang Seng Tech index, which tracks the 30 largest tech groups listed in Hong Kong, is up 25 per cent from its 2025 low on January 13. It has outpaced the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 4.4 per cent increase and a 0.5 per cent decline for the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech stocks over the past month.\n\nChina\n\nBeijing is tightening control over advanced technology, restricting engineers, equipment, and key exports as trade tensions with the US and Europe grow. New limits on battery and mineral processing technologies aim to keep critical know-how within China. Apple\u2019s key supplier, Foxconn, is among those affected as it expands in India. link\n\nChinese foundries are rapidly gaining ground in the $56.3 billion legacy chip market, undercutting prices and expanding aggressively, putting pressure on Taiwanese rivals link\n\nChina\u2019s top memory chipmaker, CXMT, is rapidly gaining global market share, challenging South Korea\u2019s Samsung and SK Hynix\u2014Its share of the $90 billion DRAM market jumped from near zero in 2020 to 5% in 2023, with analysts expecting further growth link\n\nShein is urging top Chinese suppliers to expand to Vietnam, offering up to 30% higher procurement prices, sources say link\n\nHuawei is already challenging Apple and Google in mobile OS adoption, it has also found a way to boost its smartwatch sales\u2014registering them as medical devices to allow buyers to charge the cost to their medical insurance link\n\nSupercell, the gaming house owned by Tencent, posted a 77% growth in sales link\n\nChinese EV maker BYD has introduced \u201cGod\u2019s Eye,\u201d a self-driving system set to roll out across its entire lineup.

            "content": "Is your portfolio chock-full of the same names everyone else seems to own? Perhaps you're looking for a winning stock that has flown under the radar.\n\nSuch stocks are few and far between in this record-setting market, but they're out there. Take China's e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) as an example. The company has fallen out of favor following the stock's 70% decline from its all-time high, but it's actually a compelling pick for investors.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's why you should buy Alibaba stock\n\nAlibaba's Tmall and Taobao platforms collectively control about half of China's e-commerce market (plus a significant share in a handful of neighboring countries). The other half is mostly split between Temu parent PDD Holdings and JD.com.\n\nThe roughly $60 billion of annual revenue from its online marketplaces make up less than half of the company's overall top line, however. The remaining segments include of a logistics operation called Cainiao, a cloud computing arm, and international e-commerce, among others.\n\nLike many companies, Alibaba saw its business surge early in the pandemic only to experience a growth hangover as the crisis waned. However, it's on the upswing again with third-quarter revenue up 5% year over year and net income rising nearly 60%. This progress extends top-line momentum the company has enjoyed since early last year.\n\nBABA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nWhile Alibaba seems to finally be out of its pandemic-induced funk, the reasons to consider stepping into an Alibaba stake right now are far more specific. Four of them stand out from the rest.\n\n1. Consumer spending in China is growing\n\nAs well as Alibaba may be managing and promoting its e-commerce business, its success is still ultimately tethered to the state of China's economy, and China's consumer spending in particular. That's why 2023 was such a tough year -- the pandemic's impact lingered far longer than anticipated.\n\nMatters are considerably more encouraging now. The country's retail sales have grown every month (on a year-over-year basis) for two consecutive years, buoyed by last year's reported GDP growth of 5.0%. Though market research outfit eMarketer predicts China's retail spending will only grow 3.5% this year, e-commerce spending could increase double digits, according to multiple reports.\n\n2. The state of the company is no longer in question\n\n\n\nInvestors keeping tabs on Alibaba for the past couple of years will remember management has struggled to develop a cohesive vision for the company. In late 2023, for example, it cancelled well-lauded plans to spin off its cloud computing arm. And early last year, it reversed its plans to shed its Cainiao logistics business. Even if these were ultimately the right decisions, investors didn't like the uncertainty around the future of these core operations.\n\nNow, roughly one year removed from these reversals and with concrete plans for all of its businesses (following a management shakeup), it's easier to be bullish on the company's outlook.\n\n3. It boasts a healthy balance sheet\n\nIt's not said often enough, but debt can quietly chip away at a company's market position. It limits deployable capital that might be needed to ride out tough times or when growth opportunities arise.\n\nThat's not Alibaba though. While it does have some debt, the $235 billion company is only nursing around $28.8 billion in borrowings, and it has nearly twice that amount in cash and liquid assets. Furthermore, it's generated $14.5 billion worth of free cash flow in the past year.\n\nAll of this is why Fitch Ratings rates what little debt Alibaba is carrying at a rock-solid A+. The company can handle any conceivable cash challenge or invest in growth without threatening its financial stability.\n\n4. Alibaba is an AI up-and-comer as well\n\nFinally, Alibaba has also entered the artificial intelligence fray -- one of the reasons it opted to hold onto its cloud computing business rather than shedding it back in 2023.\n\nJust a few days after Chinese start-up DeepSeek roiled the market with its low-cost, high-efficiency AI model, Alibaba unveiled its own model, Qwen 2.5-Max, which it claims is even better than DeepSeek's.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how competitive Alibaba will be in the AI race, the long-term opportunity is significant. Precedence Research suggests the industry is set to grow at an annualized pace of 19% through 2034. It's not unreasonable to believe Alibaba's AI efforts could become the next major growth engine for the company.\n\nJust keep it in perspective -- and on a short leash\n\nThough Alibaba appears to be on the upswing, it still faces tough challenges like increasing e-commerce competition and macroeconomic struggles in China.\n\nWith shares trading at just 11 times expected 2025 earnings (and still down 70% from their all-time high), I don't believe investors are pricing in nearly enough of Alibaba's potential upside. This is a rare bargain in today's market.\n\nJust keep in mind this is apt to remain a volatile ticker in the near term.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

Read our privacy policy\n\nApple is reportedly planning to release a censored version of its anticipated artificial intelligence features in China in the middle of this year in collaboration with local tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu.\n\nThe Silicon Valley giant has been working to adapt its Apple Intelligence platform for China for a rollout expected as early as May, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple\u2019s share rose by about 2 per cent on Thursday after announcing its AI partnership with the Chinese giant Alibaba.\n\nTo ensure its AI models provide outputs filtered to comply with Chinese censorship, Apple is reportedly relying on local software makers Alibaba and Baidu.\n\nA woman walks past a logo of the Apple store in Beijing ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\nChina is the second biggest market for Apple after the US, but the iPhone maker has suffered declining sales in the country.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone sales in China dropped to 43 million units in 2024 from about 52 million the previous year.\n\nAnalysts have flagged a rise in competition from local Chinese phone brands and Apple falling behind in the adoption of AI technology as potential reasons for the sales decline.\n\nChina has also come up with a powerful new AI model DeepSeek, becoming a strong competitor to American firm OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT platform.\n\nThe DeepSeek AI model\u2019s responses to some user queries have also been observed to align closely with narratives spread by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nChina: Global cloud service providers rush to embrace China's AI chatbot DeepSeek\n\nIn light of these recent AI developments, Apple may need some alterations to its existing AI platform to be more competitive in China.\n\nCurrently, the Apple Intelligence platform offers three types of AI in the US, including the tech giant\u2019s own features that run on its device, features powered by the company\u2019s internet servers, as well as OpenAI tools running on Apple\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nWhile its phones may run their AI features as they do in the US, an additional layer of Alibaba\u2019s software may censor material that the Chinese government objects to, according to Bloomberg.\n\nFor some user queries that require rewriting large chunks of text, Apple Intelligence computes a response using its connection to a secure cloud computing system that runs on Apple\u2019s Mac chips.\n\nIn China, Apple may need a local Chinese partner company for its cloud computing AI features.\n\nComplying with local Chinese laws isn\u2019t new to Apple.\n\nLast year, the tech giant was forced to remove Meta\u2019s Threads app as well as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal messaging apps off its App Store in compliance with China\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\u201d Apple said.\n\nApple\u2019s compliance with Chinese rules is seen as part of its heavy reliance on the country for both manufacturing and sales.",

            "content": "Alibaba shares soared by more than six percent on Friday following reports that Chinese President Xi Jinping was poised to meet with the tech juggernaut's co-founder Jack Ma.\n\nAlibaba, which has already surged more than 40 percent in 2025, piled on 6.3 percent after also being given an extra leg-up Thursday when its chairman said it would supply AI technology to power Apple's iPhones in China.\n\nSince coming to power more than a decade ago, Xi has consistently sought to bolster the role of state enterprises in the world's second-largest economy and warned against the \"disorderly\" expansion of private business.\n\nHe oversaw a sweeping crackdown on the tech sector that in 2020 brought the shock cancellation of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's blockbuster IPO -- notably after Ma made a speech criticising Chinese regulators.\n\nMa has kept a low public profile since then, but Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, that Xi was preparing to meet him alongside other eminent entrepreneurs.\n\nThe talks could take place as soon as next week and reportedly may include Liang Wenfeng, the founder of DeepSeek, the insurgent tech firm whose AI chatbot has caused a global stir in recent weeks.\n\nChina's commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed AFP request for comment.\n\nXi's prospective meeting with business luminaries would send a strong signal of support for the private sector at a time when China's economy is groaning under a protracted property crisis, persistently low consumption, and high local government debt.\n\nIt would also hint at the rehabilitation of Ma, a former English teacher who founded Alibaba in 1999 and built it into one of China's most recognisable and dominant private companies.\n\nBut in the years since the scuttled Ant IPO, the magnate once known for his electrifying public persona has eschewed the limelight, ostensibly to focus on philanthropy and rural education.\n\nThe stock rally adds to a promising week for Alibaba, whose chairman said Thursday that the company would supply artificial intelligence technology to power Apple's iPhones in China.\n\nJoseph Tsai said at a summit in Dubai that regulatory issues meant Apple, which has lost its status as the smartphone market leader in China, \"need to work with Chinese companies that develop AI\".\n\nmjw/je/fox",

            "content": "Stocks to Track Next Week: Alibaba, Walmart, HSBC, Rio Tinto, and Lloyds.\n\nAs trade tariffs and economic data continue to dominate market attention, the coming week will also bring several important company earnings reports. Key companies like Alibaba, Walmart, HSBC, Rio Tinto, and Lloyds will be under investor scrutiny.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) is set to release its latest quarterly results, with attention on the growth of its cloud business amid the company\u2019s ongoing push into artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWalmart (WMT) will also announce quarterly results, which could provide insight into consumer sentiment, especially as inflation in the US rises.\n\nIn the UK, major banks will be reporting their earnings, starting with HSBC (HSBA.L) on Wednesday. Investors will be watching for details on the restructuring plans of the new CEO.\n\nAnother key focus will be earnings from FTSE-listed miners, including Rio Tinto (RIO.L), which is due to report results this week.\n\nLastly, Lloyds (LLOY.L), a major UK bank, will also release its earnings, though analysts expect a decline in pre-tax income.\n\nHere's a closer look at what to expect:\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK, BABA) \u2013 Third Quarter Results Release on Thursday, 20 February\n\nAlibaba's stock has risen nearly 50% since the start of the year, driven by excitement around the company\u2019s push into AI. Investors are particularly focused on the company's cloud business and its potential for growth in this area.\n\nOn Thursday, Alibaba\u2019s chairman, Joseph Tsai, confirmed reports of the company\u2019s partnership with Apple (AAPL) to bring AI capabilities to iPhones in China. Tsai said, \"Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end they choose to do business with us,\" adding, \"They want to use our AI to power their phones.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Alibaba denied rumors that it was planning to invest in Chinese AI developer DeepSeek. This speculation came after Alibaba launched a new version of its AI model, Qwen 2.5, which it claimed surpassed the DeepSeek-V3 model.\n\nIn its second-quarter report, Alibaba revealed that AI-related product revenue within its cloud business had grown at triple-digit rates year-on-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Overall, the cloud business generated 29.6 billion Chinese yuan (\u00a33.2bn), up 7% year-on-year.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, commented on Alibaba's performance: \"The cloud business hasn\u2019t quite reached the heights of its American peers but saw strong profit growth last quarter.\"\n\n\"AI is a key driver of cloud consumption and the emergence of Chinese wannabe, DeepSeek, has caused quite a stir,\" Nathan added. \"The company\u2019s denied its intention to take a stake in the start-up but has also released its own updated AI-engine alongside some punchy performance claims. Against this backdrop, investor sentiment has strengthened materially, so there is some pressure to deliver.\"\n\nNathan also stated that Alibaba is expected to report 9% growth in the cloud business for the third quarter.\n\nOverall, Alibaba's second-quarter revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, reaching 236.5 billion Chinese yuan (\u00a325.8bn). Nathan anticipates that this figure will have increased by 7%, reaching 280 billion Chinese yuan in the third quarter.\n\n\"Markets find out next week how the eCommerce giant\u2019s core business has performed against a background of strengthening Chinese retail sales,\" Nathan concluded.\n\nStay tuned as the market\u2019s focus will be on how these companies navigate the shifting economic landscape and deliver on their earnings expectations.\n\nWalmart (WMT) \u2013 Fourth-Quarter Earnings Release on Thursday, 20 February\n\nAs one of the largest retailers globally by sales, Walmart\u2019s (WMT) earnings results are highly anticipated by Wall Street, especially amid ongoing inflationary pressures.\n\nRecent data released on Wednesday revealed that US inflation rose more than expected in January, with the consumer price index (CPI) increasing by 3% year-on-year. This was higher than economist forecasts of 2.9%.\n\nGiven this, investors will be closely watching Walmart\u2019s results for insight into the health of the US consumer.\n\nShares of Walmart closed Thursday\u2019s session at a new all-time high of $105.05 (\u00a383.25) per share, reflecting an impressive 86% increase over the past year. In the third quarter, Walmart reported sales of $169.59bn, surpassing the expected $167.5bn. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 also exceeded expectations of $0.53.\n\nFoot traffic at Walmart stores grew by 3.1% in the third quarter, surpassing the forecasted 2.82%, and e-commerce sales jumped 22%, well above expectations of 2.22%.\n\nOn the strength of these solid results, Walmart raised its guidance for the full year, now forecasting net sales growth between 4.8% and 5.1%. The retailer also guided for adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.42 and $2.47, up from the previous range of $2.35 to $2.43.\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L) \u2013 Full-Year Results Release on Wednesday, 19 February\n\nIn October, Georges Elhedery unveiled a significant overhaul of HSBC\u2019s (HSBA.L) structure, shortly after taking over as the bank's CEO.\n\nThe restructuring initiative, which took effect at the start of the year, divided the bank into four distinct businesses: Hong Kong, UK, corporate and institutional banking, as well as international wealth and premier banking. HSBC (HSBA.L) stated that this restructure was intended to reduce \"duplication of processes and decision making\" within the company.\n\nInvestors are now eagerly awaiting more details on these changes when HSBC reports its full-year results on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Times on Friday, HSBC is preparing to reveal $1.5bn in annual cost savings from the restructuring in next week\u2019s results.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reported that HSBC (HSBA.L) is planning to initiate a new round of job cuts at its investment bank next week. At the time of writing, a spokesperson for HSBC had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment.\n\nIn the third quarter, HSBC saw a 10% increase in quarterly pre-tax profits, which rose to $8.5bn. The bank also announced an additional $3bn share buyback plan.\n\nHowever, the bank\u2019s net interest income (NII)\u2014the difference between what it pays to savers and receives from borrowers\u2014fell 17% compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, its net interest margin declined by 1.46%.\n\nLooking ahead to the upcoming results, Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), commented, \"Deposit trends are worth keeping in mind, savers have been easing off their transition to longer term accounts, but HSBC is more sensitive to migration than its peers.\"\n\n\"Loan defaults will also be a hot topic with HSBC seeing its market leading credit quality slip a little of late,\" he added.\n\nBritzman also mentioned, \"To the 2024 numbers, $65.2bn in net operating income is expected to generate around $31.7bn of profit before tax.\"\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L) \u2013 Full-Year Results Release on Wednesday, 19 February\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L) is set to release its full-year results on Wednesday, 19 February, joining fellow FTSE-listed mining giants Antofagasta (ANTO.L) and Glencore (GLEN.L), both of which are also reporting next week.\n\nInvestment experts from AJ Bell, including Russ Mould, Danni Hewson, and Dan Coatsworth, have highlighted several challenges facing the mining sector over the past year. These include concerns over China\u2019s economy and its demand for raw materials, cost price inflation, and mixed commodity prices.\n\n\"Rio Tinto\u2019s biggest earner is iron ore where the price is down by nearly a fifth in the past 12 months, a trend that swamps gains in its other key metals of aluminium and copper,\" they explained.\n\nA key point of interest for investors has been reports of discussions between Rio Tinto and Glencore about a potential merger. However, it was later revealed that talks did not progress further.\n\nMould, Hewson, and Coatsworth noted: \"Rio Tinto\u2019s management will doubtless be keen to keep any such advances at more than an arm\u2019s length ... and shareholders seem happier for miners to keep a tight rein on spending and mergers and acquisitions, even after the substantial reductions in debt and improvements in balance sheets of the past decade or so.\"\n\nDespite this, investors will be paying attention to how Rio Tinto\u2019s $6.7bn acquisition of Arcadium Lithium is progressing.\n\nRegarding company performance, the investment experts forecast that Rio Tinto\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for 2024 and 2025 will remain relatively stable, estimated at $23bn to $24bn. The miner\u2019s full-year dividend for last year is expected to drop to $3.86, marking its lowest level since 2018.\n\n\"No increase is expected in 2025 either, as Rio digests Arcadium and works on several major projects, including Pilbara, the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, the Simandou iron ore venture in Guinea and expansion at the Argentinian Rincon lithium mine, where first production began last November and Rio\u2019s board has approved a $2.5bn budget to ramp up production to 60,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate a year,\" the experts said.\n\nThey also pointed out that Palliser Capital has been advocating for Rio Tinto to move its primary stock.\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L) \u2013 Full-Year Results Release on Thursday, 20 February\n\nFollowing Barclays (BARC.L) and NatWest (NWG.L), which both reported results surpassing expectations this week, investor focus is now shifting to Lloyds (LLOY.L). While these two banks saw their share prices fall post-results, the market response suggests the outcomes were not enough to impress investors.\n\nLloyds is expected to report a decline in pre-tax income for the year, forecasting a figure of \u00a36.4bn ($8.07bn), down from \u00a37.5bn in 2023. Furthermore, analysts are predicting an even further drop to \u00a35.5bn in 2025.\n\nInvestment experts at AJ Bell, including Russ Mould, Danni Hewson, and Dan Coatsworth, noted that this expected decline is \"thanks in part to a decline in net interest margins (as the Bank of England slowly cuts headline rates) and provisions relating to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into the car financing market.\"\n\nThey explained that analysts believe net interest income (NII) for the year will come in at \u00a312.8bn, lower than the \u00a313.8bn recorded in 2023. They also expect Lloyds to report a NII of \u00a313.4bn for 2025. \"Litigation and conduct costs have also been minimal in 2024, but analysts and investors will be on the lookout here for any comments on the car financing market, where Lloyds took a \u00a3450m provision in the final period of 2023,\" they added. \"The government has sought to intervene to cap any fine, but the Supreme Court will sit in judgement here in early April.\"\n\n\"Analysts expect another hit in 2025, when conduct costs are seen rising to \u00a31.5bn from \u00a3440m in 2024 and \u00a3675m in 2023,\" they said.\n\nRegarding cash returns, analysts anticipate that Lloyds will declare a total dividend of 3.09p for 2024, up from 2.65p in 2023. The bank is also expected to announce a \u00a32bn buyback.\n\n\"Such bumper cash returns, with the prospect of more to come in 2025, may be the biggest reason of all behind the storming share price performance across all of the FTSE 100\u2019s (^FTSE) Big Five banks,\" the experts said. \"However, it will be interesting to see if the torrent of buybacks abates now the shares are no longer as cheap as they were.\"",

It was the latest move in the AI battle among Chinese companies that includes tech giants Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY), as well as startups like DeepSeek.\n\nOn the stock market today, Baidu stock rose more than 1% to 97.68, building on Thursday's gains.\n\nThe Beijing-based company said in a WeChat post that users will have free access to the chatbot, which the company launched in 2023. The company is also adding a new \"deep search\" function. The bot previously cost about $8 per month for users.\n\nBaidu also said late Thursday that it will make the next Ernie AI model open-source.\n\nAI Battle: Baidu, Alibaba, DeepSeek\n\nThe news comes as tech companies in China are battling to offer advanced and powerful AI models. Alibaba scored a win earlier in the week, as The Information reported that Apple (AAPL) would use Alibaba's AI models to power new iPhone features in China.\n\nApple will also work with Baidu, however, according to a Bloomberg report that said Apple hopes to launch Apple Intelligence in China by May.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese startup DeepSeek shook up the stock market late last month by releasing a high-performing large language model, at what it said was a significantly lower development cost compared to industry leaders such as OpenAI.\n\nAlibaba also released a new model late last month it said was competitive with industry-leaders.\n\nBaidu Stock: Earnings Next Week\n\nBaidu operates China's top internet search engine, a cloud services business and a self-driving car division.\n\nIncluding Friday's early gains, Baidu stock is up 15.5% this year. But it has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 74 out of best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nThe stock has formed a consolidation pattern with a 116.25 buy point, as identified by MarketSurge. Shares stock had been hovering near Baidu's 200-day moving average since late last month but moved decisively above the long-term trendline Thursday.\n\nBaidu will report fourth quarter earnings early Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet project Baidu will post earnings of $1.97 per American depositary share on sales of RMB 33.4 billion ($4.6 billion).\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAlibaba Stock Rallies To Two-Year High After Apple AI News\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nReddit Stock Slides As User Growth Misses High Expectations After Big Rally",

In one picture, he was seen walking past the drinks aisle. In another, he was browsing the sushi section.\n\nThis comes just two days after Ma showed up at the Hangzhou offices of Xianyu, the online flea market established in 2014 by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post.

Freshippo has been expanding aggressively, opening 72 new stores across China last year - the most in five years, she said in December.\n\nFreshippo had previously logged profits in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAlibaba in 2023 postponed a planned initial public offering of Freshippo. Company co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai said in early 2024 that the company was not in a hurry to float shares of the supermarket chain, known for selling fresh food.\n\nMa, 60, has resigned from all corporate roles at Alibaba, but remains a key shareholder and spiritual leader of the company.

The publication explains how Apple Intelligence will actually work in China compared to the rest of the world, when this platform is expected to launch, and how Apple\u2019s other partner will handle some AI tasks.\n\nAccording to the report, several teams in China and the US are working to adapt the Apple Intelligence platform for the region. With a launch date expected as soon as May, this means a proper update will come a little after Apple starts offering Chinese support for its AI features with iOS 18.4.\n\nBloomberg explains that Alibaba will \u201ccensor and filter AI output to comply with requirements from the Chinese government.\u201d Additionally, Baidu will handle other AI features, such as Visual Intelligence and searches. While previous reports said Baidu wouldn\u2019t be involved with Apple Intelligence, the publication says the Chinese company will also have a role in this launch.\n\nSince Apple Intelligence has three main types of AI (on-device features, server-side functions, and OpenAI capabilities), Apple will use the same on-device AI models as it does in the rest of the world, even though Alibaba will serve as a \u201clayer on top that can censor material that the government objects to,\u201d for server-side features, the company might rely on its GBCD iCloud partner.

Morgan analyst Alex Yao, there are three key factors that could drive the share price higher. One revolves around the cloud computing business, AliCloud, which Yao thinks is currently valued as a \u201csmall and vulnerable\u201d player in China\u2019s cloud market. The recent gains might be down to an increasingly positive view regarding the advancements in generative AI and the potential returns that could generate, but the stock is still undervalued from that perspective. Based on Yao\u2019s AliCloud revenue forecast, the market has assigned a 4x 2025E EV/Rev multiple to AliCloud. This is the same multiple as Kingsoft Cloud, which the analyst considers a \u201clower-calibre player\u201d in China\u2019s cloud market. Therefore, he believes the current share price \u201cdoes not yet sufficiently price in AliCloud as one of the best assets in China\u2019s cloud market.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, due to \u201cincreasing consumption\u201d of AI features, there could be a positive revenue revision for AliCloud, with Yao\u2019s conservative forecast projecting 10% growth in FY26. The analyst sees potential for a 10ppt (percentage point) upward adjustment to this estimate. At a 6.5x 2025E EV/Rev multiple, each 2ppt increase in AliCloud\u2019s revenue growth rate translates to a 1% rise in the share price.\n\nLastly, there could be another share price driver in the shape of a positive earnings revision boosted by \u201cimproving fundamentals\u201d in domestic e-commerce, with JPM\u2019s FY26 adj. EPS forecast standing 12% above BBG consensus. That is down to Yao\u2019s optimistic outlook for e-commerce profitability.\n\nAll told, Alibaba remains Yao\u2019s \u201cfavorite stock in the China internet space,\u201d with the analyst maintaining an Overweight (i.e., Buy) on the shares along with a $125 price target. That said, given the recent surge, the shares are nearing that level. It will be interesting to see if Yao adjusts his model shortly. (To watch Yao\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story amongst most of Yao\u2019s colleagues. Based on a mix of 11 Buys vs. 1 Hold, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, going by the $121.83 average target, bbshares will remain rangebound for the time being.

More parameters often lead to more powerful models.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT3 has about 175 billion parameters, while ChatGPT4 has about 1.8 trillion parameters. The architecture of ChatGPT4 consists of eight models, each of which has 220 billion parameters.\n\nOn January 28 this year, Alibaba unveiled Qwen2.5-Max, which claims to have been trained on over 20 trillion parameters. It said Qwen2.5-Max performs much better than DeepSeek.\n\nIt would be no surprise if Qwen2.5 can perform better than DeepSeek. DeepSeek\u2019s developers said in a research paper on January 22 that they had \u201cdistilled\u201d data from Qwen2.5 when training their AI models.\n\nIn the process of \u201cknowledge distillation,\u201d DeepSeek is a student who keeps asking questions to a knowledgeable teacher, such as ChatGPT or Qwen2.5, and uses the answers to fine-tune its logic.\n\nIn this case, Qwen2.5 is a teacher trained by Alibaba with significant computing powers and data while DeepSeek is just a student, or a distill version of other AI models.\n\nZhou Chang, an algorithm engineer at Alibaba and the person in charge of the Qwen2.5 AI model, left Alibaba last July, taking along a team of about 10 engineers to join ByteDance.\n\nMedia reports said Zhou\u2019s annual salary at Alibaba was about 2 million yuan (US$275,691). Zhou was offered a package of at least 10 million yuan from ByteDance. But Alibaba reportedly filed a lawsuit against him claiming he wasn\u2019t entitled to join a competitor.\n\nUS restrictions\n\nLast October, the Biden administration finaliszd a set of rules that aim to forbid US investments in certain national security technologies and products in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nThe rules, effective on January 2 this year, cover China\u2019s AI, Quantum and semiconductor sectors.\n\nOn January 29, Josh Hawley, a Republican Senator, introduced a bill titled \u201cDecoupling America\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act of 2025,\u201d calling for prohibitions on the import and export of AI or generative AI technology or intellectual property.\n\nIf passed by the US Congress, the Act might forbid people from \u201cimporting\u201d iPhones powered by Chinese AI technologies. However, whether and when this bill will be passed is still a question.\n\nYong Jian is a contributor to the Asia Times.

            "content": "Key points:\n\nAlibaba's s tock s urge and AI b reakthroughs : Alibaba's stock has surged 50% from its January lows, driven by AI advancements and a strategic partnership with Apple. The company's Qwen AI model has outperformed competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o and Meta's LLaMA, positioning Alibaba as a strong contender in the global AI race. Strategic p artnership with Apple : Alibaba's AI credibility received a significant boost when Apple announced it would use Alibaba's models for iPhone AI services in China. This partnership could lead to increased usage and revenue for Alibaba's cloud division, solidifying its status as a key AI infrastructure provider in the region. Stabilizing c ore businesses but with r isks : While Alibaba's core e-commerce business is stabilizing and cloud revenue is expected to grow, several risks remain. These include potential tariff threats and geopolitical tensions, challenges in AI monetization, lagging global peers in cloud business, fierce domestic competition, the possibility of Apple's AI rollout failing, and China's economic uncertainty.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock (BABA) has surged more than 46% from its January lows, leaving domestic rivals, broader Chinese indices, and even U.S. tech giants in the dust. While Wall Street remains fixated on the Magnificent 7 and is now shifting attention towards finding companies that can deliver on AI monetization, Alibaba has quietly staged a remarkable comeback. The Chinese e-commerce giant is powered by AI breakthroughs, a strategic partnership with Apple, and a still-undervalued stock.\n\nFrom crackdowns to comeback\n\nAlibaba\u2019s resurgence is a stark contrast to its turbulent recent past.\n\nIn late 2020, co-founder Jack Ma\u2019s public criticism of regulators triggered a crackdown that derailed Ant Group\u2019s IPO and cast a long shadow over the entire Chinese tech sector. Over the next two years, Alibaba was hit by regulatory scrutiny, pandemic disruptions, and slowing consumer demand. The stock tumbled more than 75% from its peak.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com chipped away at its e-commerce dominance. The company\u2019s internal restructuring into six business units, while strategically sound, added to the uncertainty.\n\nBut 2025 tells a different story. Beijing has pivoted to pro-growth policies, Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business is stabilizing, and its AI investments are paying off. The result is a stock that investors can\u2019t ignore anymore. Let\u2019s take an account of what\u2019s driving the resurgence of this Chinese tech giant.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Qwen AI model is cheaper and more efficient than DeepSeek\n\nThe global AI race isn\u2019t just a Western story. While Nvidia, Meta, and OpenAI grab headlines, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 Max model has quietly emerged as a top contender. Recent benchmark tests show Qwen outperforming OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 4o, Meta\u2019s LLaMA and DeepSeek\u2019s-V3, two of the highly-regarded models in the AI landscape.\n\nWith government support for domestic AI development and Alibaba\u2019s established cloud infrastructure, the company is well-positioned to dominate this space. If DeepSeek continues to lose steam, Alibaba could enjoy first-mover advantages in critical sectors like logistics, retail, and manufacturing.\n\nApple AI deal could be a strategic breakthrough\n\nAlibaba\u2019s AI ambitions received a massive credibility boost when Apple announced it would use Alibaba\u2019s models for iPhone AI services in China.\n\nThis partnership is more than a headline-grabber. With iPhones commanding significant market share in China, Alibaba\u2019s cloud services will power core AI functionalities for millions of users. As Chinese consumers adopt more AI-driven services, Alibaba\u2019s cloud division could see a meaningful uptick in usage and revenue.\n\nIf Apple\u2019s AI launch gains traction, this partnership might solidify Alibaba\u2019s status as the go-to provider for AI infrastructure in the region.\n\nTangible earnings growth on the horizon\n\nWhile AI is the buzzword, Alibaba\u2019s core e-commerce business - its profit engine - is stabilizing. Recent reports suggest improved consumer sentiment and increased online spending, particularly on Taobao and Tmall.\n\nCloud revenue growth, long a disappointment, could get a boost from its Apple partnership and enterprise AI demand. Analysts expect 24% EPS growth in 2025 and a slowing capex spend.\n\nTariff headwinds could remain manageable\n\nTariff uncertainties demand caution on China. While the recent 10% tariff and the rollback of the \u201cde minimis\u201d duty-free exemption could hurt low-cost e-commerce imports, Alibaba\u2019s geographically diverse footprint may help it mitigate the impact. Unlike PDD, which relies heavily on U.S. shipments through Temu, Alibaba has built a more global supply network.\n\nThis international diversification could insulate Alibaba\u2019s overseas operations and allow it to maintain its price advantage in key markets. If tariffs escalate, investors may increasingly favor Alibaba over more U.S.-dependent rivals.\n\nAlibaba remains a relative bargain\n\nEven after its recent surge, BABA trades at just 12x forward earnings, below its five-year average of 14.6x and significantly cheaper than U.S. tech peers.\n\nFor context, Amazon trades at over 30x earnings, despite both companies operating similarly scaled e-commerce and cloud businesses. With earnings growth finally returning, Alibaba\u2019s valuation looks increasingly attractive for investors seeking a discounted tech play with AI upside.\n\nUpcoming catalysts: What\u2019s next for Alibaba?\n\nApple\u2019s AI Launch in China (Expected Q1/Q2 2025) : Success here could significantly boost Alibaba\u2019s cloud utilization. If consumers embrace AI-powered iPhone features like smart assistants and real-time translations, Alibaba will benefit directly.\n\nEarnings Report (Expected Late February/Early March) : Investors will be watching for growth in AI services and potential improvements in cloud profitability. Analysts expect a moderate rebound in core commerce revenue, thanks to better consumer sentiment and holiday season performance.\n\nChina\u2019s Policy Stimulus (Ongoing) : Beijing has pledged more stimulus in 2025, including measures to boost consumer spending and support tech innovation. Any signs of follow-through could lift Alibaba\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nRisks to watch\n\nDespite the bullish tailwinds, risks remain:",

His comments followed reports earlier this week about a collaboration between the companies.\n\n\u201cApple has been very selective,\u201d said Tsai, whose comments were reported by the Financial Times (FT). \u201cThey talked to a number of companies in China and in the end they chose to do business with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to use our AI to power their phones, so we\u2019re very fortunate and extremely honored to be able to do business with a great company like Apple,\u201d the executive added.\n\nApple rolled out its AI offering \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d \u2014 last year after introducing the latest version of its flagship smartphone.\n\nHowever, the company has had trouble bringing its AI capabilities to China, which requires large language models to undergo strict testing and receive regulatory approvals. Apple has been looking for a China-based partner to help it through that process.\n\nA report earlier this week from The Information said Apple has since 2023 been testing various AI models from a host of Chinese developers, including Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent and Baidu. The latter company briefly formed a partnership with Apple, that report said, but that arrangement ended after Baidu\u2019s efforts fell short of Apple\u2019s standards.\n\nApple also considered but eventually passed on AI startup DeepSeek, as that company\u2019s team couldn\u2019t provide the manpower or expertise to support a company of Apple\u2019s size, the report added.\n\nThe partnership comes as Apple is struggling in China. The company\u2019s sales there fell 11.1% during the latest quarter to $18.51 billion, the largest downturn in revenues in that country since the same quarter in 2024, when they slipped 12.9%.\n\n\u201cWe did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during an earnings call.\n\nAccording to the FT, Tsai said that Apple could undertake AI partnerships with other companies outside China, \u201cbut inside China, because of regulatory issues and things like that, they need to work with Chinese companies that develop AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that is going to be the case wherever you do business in the future; you may want to have a localized AI that powers your devices,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end, they choose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones,\u201d Joe Tsai, chairman of Alibaba, said on Thursday during a speech at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.\n\nHe did not provide further details like a timeline for the release or whether Alibaba will be the exclusive partner.\n\nNews of the partnership was first reported by The Information. It said Apple also considered other Chinese AI firms like DeepSeek, Baidu, ByteDance and Tencent before ultimately selecting Alibaba.\n\nCNN has reached out to Apple and Alibaba for further comment.\n\nDue to local compliance issues and regulatory concerns, Apple has so far only been able to release its AI service, Apple Intelligence, to limited markets, including the US, Canda, UK and Australia. The Chinese government mandates that foreign AI operators need to partner with a local company and obtain regulatory approval.\n\nApple has been losing market share in China to domestic rivals such as Huawei and Vivo. Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys, a market research firm, said while AI services are expected to help Apple gain users in China, challenges remain.\n\n\u201cApple faces a much more challenging competitive landscape in China, especially amid Huawei\u2019s strong resurgence. Relying solely on AI services may not be enough to turn the tide,\u201d he said.\n\nApple had dominated China\u2019s high-end smartphone market for years before Huawei rose through the ranks and began posing a credible challenge. But in 2019, US President Donald Trump moved to impose trade restrictions on Huawei.\n\nInitially, those curbs hit Huawei\u2019s business hard. But eventually, they incentivized Huawei to adapt and innovate, which culminated at the launch of Mate 60 Pro in 2023 that triggered an US government\u2019s investigation. Huawei\u2019s transformation, coupled with strong patriotic sentiment among some Chinese people, has powered its rise.\n\nLast year, Huawei, posted a market share of 16% in China, overtaking Apple\u2019s 15%, according to Canalys data. In 2023, Apple was the top mobile phone seller in the country with 19% of market share. Huawei trailed behind at 12%.\n\nThe confirmed partnership with Apple has boosted investors\u2019 confidence in Alibaba. Its Hong Kong-listed shares has surged by more than 40% since hitting a two-year low in January.\n\nShortly after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled an AI model in January that stunned Wall Street, Alibaba unveiled its latest version of its Qwen AI model, saying it was better than its competitor\u2019s R1 model.\n\nSpeaking at the same event on Thursday via video, Elon Musk, said the next generation of his company xAI\u2019s large language model, Grok 3, would be released in one to two weeks, touting it as the best AI chatbot on the market.\n\n\u201cIn the tests that we\u2019ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that\u2019s been released, that we\u2019re aware of,\u201d the tech mogul said.\n\nMusk founded xAI with the goal of challenging OpenAI, the company he co-founded, as well as other AI giants like Google.",

The company\u2019s shares have rallied strongly since January 10, as investors wake up to Alibaba as a serious competitor in the AI peloton. Currently, Alibaba stands out as a market leader in Chinese e-commerce with a galvanized balance sheet and a mushrooming cloud business already monetizing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMaximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:\n\nLeverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.\n\nMonitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio\n\nMoreover, the sprawling Chinese marketplace is now partnering with U.S. giant Apple in a symbolic poke in the eye to politically fearful naysayers. BABA\u2019s valuation remains balanced despite the political risk of trading on the NYSE as a Chinese company.\n\nBABA Stock Remains Reasonably Priced Despite the Political Risk\n\nAlibaba is undeniably a strong and diverse business, leading the e-commerce space in one of the most powerful economies in the world. However, this also brings risks that have troubled Alibaba investors for a while: its close ties to political issues. Geopolitical tensions, a heavy-handed government, and economic weakness in China have pressured Alibaba\u2019s American Depositary Receipts (ADR), which are still down almost 70% from their peak in 2020.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Price history over the past 5 years\n\nThis broader economic situation is behind the underperformance of Alibaba\u2019s business fundamentals. Revenue growth has slowed to single digits in recent years, and free cash flow margins are now just a third of what they used to be. These struggles have caused even some of the most dedicated Alibaba bulls to give up in recent years.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) revenue, earnings and profit margin history dating back to 2019\n\nDespite all these challenges, I still believe there are reasons to consider Alibaba. Let\u2019s start with the company\u2019s valuation. Over the past 12 months, Alibaba generated $137 billion in revenue, $12.3 billion in net income, and $14 billion in free cash flow. This results in relatively low multiples for a company of its size\u20142x revenue, 13.2x earnings, and 18.8x free cash flow, even though at a premium versus key local peers such as JD (JD).\n\nEven though growth has slowed, Alibaba is a decent stock to have in one\u2019s portfolio. The Chinese giant has around $85 billion in investments on its balance sheet, such as cash, short-term investments, equity securities, and investments in equity method investees, including a mix of public and private businesses. When you factor those investments in, the company\u2019s enterprise value drops to $159 billion, meaning its valuation is around 11x free cash flow. On TipRanks, the stock carries a Smart Score of 10, with almost all indicators currently bullish.\n\nStory Continues",

Learn More.\n\nAlibaba Group Chairman Joe Tsai announced today that Apple has finalized a deal with Alibaba to integrate AI-powered features into iPhones sold in China. Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, Tsai revealed that Apple engaged with multiple Chinese AI providers before choosing Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model for its localized AI strategy.\n\nThis partnership follows months of speculation about how Apple would navigate China\u2019s AI restrictions while remaining competitive against domestic smartphone brands.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook previously highlighted that markets with AI integration saw higher iPhone upgrade rates, but China remained an exception, leading to a rare sales dip. The lack of AI-powered features during a crucial sales period resulted in China being the only Apple market to experience a revenue decline. Industry analysts have suggested this shortfall underlines the urgency of AI integration in the region.\n\nWhy Apple chose Alibaba over rivals\n\nApple had initially explored a partnership with Baidu as its primary AI provider but reconsidered due to concerns over technical alignment and regulatory approval. The company then conducted evaluations based on AI model performance, compliance with Chinese regulations, and scalability.\n\nThe company ultimately chose Alibaba\u2019s Qwen AI model, citing its advanced capabilities and seamless integration potential. Meanwhile, DeepSeek was reportedly eliminated from consideration due to limited infrastructure to support a large-scale deployment.\n\nThis new partnership marks a significant shift in Apple\u2019s relationship with Alibaba, a company it has historically engaged with only indirectly. Apple accessories are available on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms, such as AliExpress and Taobao, but the company does not officially market its flagship products there. Additionally, Apple Pay competes with Alibaba\u2019s Alipay in the financial sector.\n\nThe AI partnership represents a strategic move for both companies, aligning Apple with one of China\u2019s top technology firms. The companies have already taken steps to ensure regulatory compliance, submitting AI models for review by Chinese internet authorities.\n\nRegaining market share\n\nAs Apple prepares to unveil its fourth-generation iPhone SE, its partnership with Alibaba is expected to play a pivotal role in Apple\u2019s China strategy. The budget-friendly iPhone SE has been a game-changer for Apple in China and India, the world\u2019s two largest smartphone markets, significantly boosting iPhone sales.\n\nThe upcoming SE model will be central to Apple\u2019s market recovery strategy, particularly as Chinese competitors continue to roll out AI-powered smartphones.\n\nBeyond China, Apple is actively expanding its AI strategy on a global scale. The company is working with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri as part of its Apple Intelligence program in the United States. Reports also suggest that Apple is exploring additional AI partnerships, including discussions with Google regarding potential integrations of its Gemini AI model.",

But in recent weeks, the report said, its stock has jumped 46%, expanding its market value by close to $87 billion.\n\nThe reason? Enthusiasm for the company\u2019s efforts to create its own AI services and platform, something that gained fuel when Chinese startup DeepSeek released a model that caused a number of American tech stocks to plunge.\n\nThen came a report this week from The Information that Apple had teamed up with Alibaba to launch AI features on its iPhones sold in China.\n\nApple rolled out its AI features last year after the launch of the iPhone 16. But the company had to delay the introduction of its \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d in China, due to a government rule requiring Apple to work with local tech developers in building AI models for devices sold there.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of DeepSeek has sparked a new AI-related catalyst for Chinese tech stocks,\u201d Andy Wong, investment and ESG director for Asia Pacific at Solomons Group, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWithin this space, we see Alibaba as having more tangible and well-established earnings growth prospects in the medium term.\u201d\n\nBloomberg also notes that Chinese AI companies face a significant hurdle: consumers and businesses in that country have been slower to adopt and less willing to pay for services.\n\n\u201cMany hedge funds and long-only investors see AI as a potential inflection point for Alibaba, with some expressing interest in understanding the valuation of Alibaba\u2019s cloud business and any upside from large language models,\u201d JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote in a note, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe AI narrative is seen as a driver for potential re-rating, but there are concerns about the monetization of AI capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS wrote Wednesday about new research showing that 82% of workers who use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) each week believe it can increase productivity.\n\nBut as familiarity with GenAI increases, so too do worries about job displacement. The research found that half of workers who use GenAI weekly are concerned that the technology could someday eliminate their job, compared to 24% of those unfamiliar with it.\n\n\u201cAs workers gain a better understanding of GenAI\u2019s capabilities, they are becoming more aware of the possible risks to their jobs,\u201d that report said.\n\n\u201cThose who use GenAI weekly are much more likely to believe it can replace aspects of their job compared to those unfamiliar with the technology.\u201d\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

Upgrades, a key driver of Apple device sales, have been more common in regions where the AI features have launched, like the U.S. The deal could also allow Apple to access the data Alibaba has collected through its e-commerce offerings to allow the AI products to be more personalized, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAlibaba Shares on Five-Day Winning Streak\n\nWednesday marks the fifth straight winning session for Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares. Jefferies analysts lifted their price target to $150 from $144 on Wednesday, without yet mentioning or factoring in the reported Apple partnership in its research report.\n\nJPMorgan analysts said Tuesday that they don't expect Apple to confirm the partnership until the features are ready to be launched, but said the rollout could mark \"significant progress\" for Apple in China and help boost sales of the iPhone 16, or the iPhone 17 the company is expected to announce later this year.\n\nShares of Alibaba rose almost 5% on Wednesday to close at their highest level in more than two years.

The two companies have submitted the AI tools to regulators in China for approval. Apple had previously considered partnering with Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY), according to the report.\n\nAlibaba's momentum this year has been helped by its overall AI push. On Jan. 29, the company released an AI model it said outperforms the models of China-based rival DeepSeek. Alibaba's models are also comparable to \"top tier models,\" the company said.\n\nShares have rallied in the weeks since.

According to U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, investors may want to sell the Magnificent Seven after none of them delivered a positive earnings surprise this reporting season. To be fair, one important company still hasn\u2019t reported its financial results for the final quarter of 2024. Regardless, the firm isn\u2019t broadly optimistic about the stocks.\n\n\u201cThis marks the first quarter with no positive sales surprises for the [Magnificent Seven] since 2022.\u201d\n\nOn that note, Kostin has advised that investors may begin shifting capital to other technology companies, specifically those involved in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Trending on News and Analyst Ratings and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nFor those wondering exactly which artificial intelligence companies to invest in, Kostin suggests allocating capital to \u201cAI Phase 3\u201d companies. These companies have the potential to monetize AI by generating incremental revenues, such as in software and information technology (IT) services.\n\nWhile choosing AI stocks for investment is important, an even more serious development in the tech world is the ongoing AI Summit in Paris. The summit has launched new partnerships, foundations, and projects as yet, and the BBC has also recently reported on an international agreement on artificial intelligence (AI) at the Summit.\n\nAccording to the source, the US and the UK have reportedly declined to sign the agreement. While dozens of countries including France, China, and India, have already signed the charter that pledges an \u201copen\u201d, \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cethical\u201d approach to the technology\u2019s development, these two countries have chosen to decline instead.\n\nThe UK government has cited concerns about national security and \u201cglobal governance\u201d as reasons for not signing the agreement. Meanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance told delegates in Paris earlier that too much artificial intelligence (AI) technology regulation could \u201ckill a transformative industry just as it\u2019s taking off\u201d.\n\nAccording to Vance, AI was \u201can opportunity that the Trump administration will not squander\u201d and said \u201cpro-growth AI policies\u201d should be prioritized over safety.\n\nOn the contrary, French President Emmanuel Macron has defended the need for further regulation.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Despite a hotter-than-expected inflation report this morning, Chinese tech stocks shook off the bad news and marched higher. The beaten-down sector continues to advance since the emergence of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot.\n\nShares of the large search and e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA 5.72%) had risen 4.4% as of 11:34 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, shares of the digital finance company Futu Holdings (FUTU 0.67%) had surged 8.4%, and shares of the large tech and videogame company Tencent Holdings (TCEHY 2.32%) were up 3.5%.\n\nAlibaba forms big potential partnership\n\nAfter January's inflation data came in above estimates, most major market indexes sold off as investors further doubted whether the Federal Reserve would be able to cut interest rates more this year with inflation still well above the Fed's preferred 2% target.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for AI language models to be built more efficiently has some investors taking another look at Chinese tech stocks, which have performed well as of late. The Hang Seng Index has rocketed nearly 16% over the last month despite continued struggles in China's economy from deflationary pressure and an ailing property sector.\n\n\"China has established a stronger presence in AI-powered applications,\" JPMorgan Chase strategists wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"The combination of increasing AI adoption and relatively low valuations positions Chinese tech for potential outperformance.\"\n\nAlibaba rose today on media reports that the consumer tech giant Apple has tapped Alibaba to bring more AI features to iPhone users in China. The Information first reported the news. The move will reportedly bring more AI functionality that Chinese users specifically want but also in a way that's compliant with China's strict AI doctrine. The move will also likely make the iPhone more competitive against companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. It's also a testament to Alibaba's AI capabilities because Apple reportedly considered technology and AI models from several other large Chinese tech companies.\n\nFutu also surged after analysts at Bank of America reiterated a buy on the stock yesterday and upped their price target from $108 to $129. Bank of America expects the online financial platform to see a significant 30% quarterly increase in new paying clients, while total client assets are projected to rise by 7%. Strong asset inflows and the ability to maintain a gross profit margin of nearly 93% have made analysts bullish.\n\nI'm not seeing anything specific about Tencent, but as one of the largest Chinese tech companies specializing in content and video gaming, it's not surprising that it's joining in on the rally. More efficient AI would be a big deal for the company, especially as the U.S. continues to contemplate further chip restrictions.\n\nAdvantages of cheaper valuations\n\nBecause of the country's economic struggles, Chinese tech stocks have not enjoyed the same run as U.S. stocks. But many of these tech companies are large, highly innovative, and can grow earnings nicely, all while trading at cheaper valuations. The advantage of cheaper valuations is that they can get going quickly on any good news, which is why many investors are starting to look internationally as U.S. valuations remain elevated.\n\nAlibaba, Futu, and Tencent all have strong potential. However, due to economic struggles and the Chinese government's influence, they are likely to be more volatile, so investors need to be aware of this and have the stomach to weather more erratic moves.",

Apple didn\u2019t have much choice about finding a Chinese partner to get its AI tools approved by regulators. However, Alibaba isn't the expected partner, according to the report. Apple had apparently planned to work with Baidu before deciding that Baidu's AI models weren't quite what they wanted.\n\nThe company reportedly considered offerings from other Chinese AI developers, including e-commerce giant Tencent and TikTok owner ByteDance. Apple even considered teaming up with DeepSeek before its explosive debut in the U.S. However, according to the report, Apple ultimately ruled out DeepSeek because it simply didn\u2019t have the workforce or experience to handle a deal of this scale.\n\nUltimately, Alibaba emerged as Apple's choice for a few reasons, according to the report. By far, the biggest is that Alibaba has access to a staggering amount of data on Chinese consumers. With insights into shopping, payments, and general digital behavior, Alibaba\u2019s AI could help Apple offer more personalized and localized features to iPhone users in China. Beyond the regulatory demands, Alibaba could also help Apple stand out from its Chinese competitors. Huawei, in particular, has been ramping up its AI-enhanced smartphone sales for nearly a year, enticing those who might previously have bought iPhones.\n\niPhone Alibaba\n\nAlibaba's involvement might speed up the approval process for AI features with Chinese regulators. Based on the report, Apple device owners in China might see some smarter Siri responses, improved search capabilities, and better personalization options appear on their devices as a result of the deal.\n\nApple has long been known for tightly controlling its ecosystem. This partnership would force Apple to open up a little and relinquish some of that control to embed Alibaba\u2019s AI. It\u2019s a necessary compromise to stay in the Chinese market, but it also raises questions about how regional differences will change Apple products.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

            "content": "The Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader still has room to run.\n\nAlibaba's (BABA 5.72%) stock closed at a record high of $306.16 on Oct. 27, 2020. At the time, investors were impressed by the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader's wide moat, rapid growth rates, and its expansion into adjacent markets.\n\nBut by Oct. 24, 2022, Alibaba's stock had dropped below its IPO price of $68 and closed at its all-time low of $60.99. Its stock crashed as China's antitrust regulators cracked down on its e-commerce business, formidable competitors like PDD Holdings gained ground, and the broader economy cooled off.\n\nHowever, Alibaba's stock now trades at about $103. It bounced back as its growth stabilized, it streamlined its sprawling business, and it found fresh ways to expand its higher-growth overseas e-commerce and logistics businesses. Let's take a look at the three top reasons Alibaba's stock is still worth accumulating after that impressive recovery.\n\n1. Alibaba's business is gradually stabilizing\n\nAlibaba's revenue growth decelerated significantly from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 (which ended in March 2023). That slowdown was caused by the tighter antitrust restrictions for its e-commerce business, which forced it to end its exclusive deals with merchants and limit its promotional strategies; tougher competition, and the macroeconomic headwinds in China.\n\nMetric FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 1H FY 2025 Revenue growth 41% 19% 2% 8% 5% Adj. net income growth 30% (21%) 4% 11% (9%)\n\nBut over the past two and a half years, Alibaba's growth rates stabilized as it expanded its overseas and cross-border marketplaces (Lazada in Southeast Asia, Trendyol in Turkey, and AliExpress for its overseas markets) to reduce its dependence on its maturing Taobao and Tmall marketplaces in China. It also expanded its higher-growth Cainiao logistics business as its cloud infrastructure business recovered.\n\nAlibaba's investments in its higher-growth businesses are compressing its near-term margins, but they'll likely pay off in the future. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 6% and 1%, respectively, as the Chinese New Year gives its e-commerce business a slight boost through the end of fiscal 2025. For fiscal 2026, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 8% and 13%, respectively, as that recovery continues.\n\n2. Alibaba's artificial intelligence (AI) investments are paying off\n\nIn 2023, Alibaba launched Qwen, a new family of large language models (LLMs) running on its cloud infrastructure platform. In Jan. 2025, it launched the most powerful version, Qwen 2.5-Max, which it claims can outperform other LLM foundation models like OpenAI's GPT-4o, Meta Platforms' Llama-3.1-405B, and DeepSeek's V3.\n\nAlibaba's rivals will inevitably dispute and challenge those claims, but they indicate the company can continue to expand its AI business even as the U.S. tightens its export curbs on AI chips. Alibaba has been cagey regarding the exact details of Qwen's development, but it's likely powered by a mix of existing Nvidia GPUs, its own first-party AI accelerators, and open-source software running on its own cloud platform.\n\nQwen's AI expansion could drive more AI-oriented developers and companies to sign up for Alibaba's cloud infrastructure services. The cloud intelligence group's revenue already rose 7% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2025, but it only accounted for 11% of its top line. These fresh AI tailwinds could turn it into a major growth engine again.\n\n3. Alibaba stock looks dirt cheap relative to its growth potential\n\nAlibaba's stock bounced back, but it still looks historically cheap at 11 times forward earnings. By comparison, Alphabet and Amazon trade at 21 and 37 times forward earnings, respectively.\n\nAlibaba trades at such a discount to its U.S. counterparts because the threats of higher tariffs and escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China are still driving many investors away from Chinese stocks. But if the two sides hold more talks and dial down the pressure, we could see value-seeking investors pivot back toward leading Chinese stocks like Alibaba.\n\nInvestors should keep their eye on its long-term growth potential\n\nAlibaba faces a lot of formidable challenges, but it will likely remain China's top e-commerce and cloud company for the foreseeable future. If you expect it to weather the near-term headwinds as it expands its higher-growth overseas commerce, logistics, cloud, and AI businesses, then it could be the perfect time to buy its undervalued stock.",

Here's why.\n\nTrump's tariffs spark stimulus hopes\n\nOver the weekend, Trump announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States, and vowed reciprocal tariffs on countries that tax U.S. imports, which could affect additional Chinese products.\n\nWhile the U.S. barely imports any steel from China, China is a big exporter globally, and many countries to which China exports steel and aluminum products in turn export their own more expensive steel and aluminum products to the U.S., increasing supply here. In addition, China exports semi-processed steel to countries like Vietnam for processing, which then export the finished product as \"Vietnamese\" steel, for example, to the U.S.\n\nSo if the new tariffs increase prices on steel imported to the U.S., those indirect channels for Chinese steel may be cut off, incrementally harming China's steel exports.\n\nWhy would Chinese-exposed stocks go up on that news? Likely, investors believe the new trade restrictions may spur China's leaders to increase domestic stimulus to consumers, making up lost industrial revenue with domestic consumption. Of note, there are key political meetings coming up in March, in which additional stimulus measures could be announced.\n\nIncreased consumer spending in China would obviously benefit e-commerce leader Alibaba, as well as Nike and Estee Lauder. Nike derived over 15% of its revenue from China in fiscal 2024, and Estee Lauder's stock has recently been decimated by a downturn in Chinese makeup sales. At its peak in 2021, China accounted for 34% of Estee Lauder's revenue, before the business segment descended into a severe multiyear decline.\n\nEstee Lauder and Nike are also coming off especially bad weeks, with Nike receiving an analyst downgrade on Friday, and Estee Lauder plunging following its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. So, it's perhaps not a surprise to see each bouncing back off recent lows today.\n\nAlibaba may also be benefiting from increased optimism for Chinese tech stocks following the unveiling of DeepSeek's R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model last month, which sent shockwaves through the global artificial intelligence industry. DeepSeek seemed to reinvigorate sentiment around the competitive prowess of Chinese technology firms.\n\nNot to be outdone, Alibaba also has a family of open-source AI models on the market named \"Qwen,\" and there was additional positive news around Qwen AI models today. According to the South China Post, researchers at Stanford and Berkeley published a paper claiming they have produced a new AI reasoning model for just $50 using Alibaba's Qwen2.5-32b-Instruct model as the \"base\" model. Like DeepSeek, Qwen models are open-source, which allows outside parties and researchers to access the model's weights. According to the researchers, their new model bested OpenAI's o1-preview on math and programming skills. While OpenAI is already out with its next o3 reasoning models today, building a competitive model to the recent prior generation for just $50 is notable.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what financial benefit Alibaba may reap from others training reasoning models with its open-source technology. But the fact that the Chinese tech giant is offering competitive AI models was enough to boost sentiment today.\n\nChina's stocks could boom or bust\n\nComing out of a multiyear downturn, Chinese stocks have risen over the past year on hopes for significant stimulus from the government. While new measures have been announced and officials have pledged to do what it takes to get growth going again, some analysts have remained skeptical, as the government has eschewed direct subsidies to consumers for more indirect infrastructure stimulus and lower interest rates.\n\nStill, leading Chinese tech stocks trade at much lower valuations than their U.S. counterparts, and China-exposed consumer discretionary stocks like Nike and Estee Lauder have been decimated. Certainly, Trump's election could also flame tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nBut if the recovery continues and the government delivers more powerful stimulus measures in March, there could be a continued recovery for these stocks.",

Appaloosa Management raised its stakes in Alibaba , PDD and JD.com in the fourth quarter as they continued to be among Tepper's biggest holdings, according to a new 13F regulatory filing. The hedge fund also increased its investment in iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) last quarter to a stake worth more than $200 million. The fund also boosted its ownership in KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) . In late September, Tepper told CNBC he is buying \"everything\" related to China because of Beijing's signal for massive fiscal support. Back then, the high-profile investor even said he was raising his usual allocation limit and was not hedging his big China bet. Chinese policymakers have already cut interest rates to boost growth, and investors now await more detail on the nation's promised stimulus measures , which could target areas including weak consumer demand and the struggling real estate market. The world's second-largest economy beat forecasts with 5.4% growth in the final quarter of 2024, but significant concerns remain over deflation and the potential effects of President Donald Trump's new 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with targeted retaliatory duties and vowed to take measures to protect its interests in the face of \"bullying.\" Outside of China, Tepper added a relatively small new bet on materials tech company Corning , worth about $71 million at the end of 2024.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nUS tech giants appear unfazed by the success of China\u2019s cheap alternative AI models like DeepSeek as they announced roadmaps to invest billions of dollars this year in AI.\n\nOn February 10th, US equity features rose, hinting at a rebound from steep losses on February 7th as markets absorbed Donald Trump\u2019s intentions to impose 25% tariffs on all US steel and aluminum imports.\n\n\u201cRisky assets are getting a bit desensitized to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement,\u201d said Mohit Kumar at Jefferies. \u201cOur view in tariffs remains that they will cause volatility, are a negotiating tool and will eventually be not as bad as feared. However, we do see scope for further volatility over the coming weeks, with Europe likely to be the next target.\n\nThe gains in US stock futures could signal several buyers seeking to return to the market after the 1% retreat in the S&P 500 late last week.\n\nElsewhere, TSMC, the biggest contract chipmaker globally, said today that its Q1 revenue could hover at the lower end of its guidance due to $161 million in losses induced by earthquakes in January.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nYet in a counterintuitive move, China-exposed stocks rallied today after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum over the weekend. Here's why.\n\nTrump's tariffs spark stimulus hopes\n\nOver the weekend, Trump announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States, and vowed reciprocal tariffs on countries that tax U.S. imports, which could affect additional Chinese products.\n\nWhile the U.S. barely imports any steel from China, China is a big exporter globally, and many countries to which China exports steel and aluminum products in turn export their own more expensive steel and aluminum products to the U.S., increasing supply here. In addition, China exports semi-processed steel to countries like Vietnam for processing, which then export the finished product as \"Vietnamese\" steel, for example, to the U.S.\n\nSo if the new tariffs increase prices on steel imported to the U.S., those indirect channels for Chinese steel may be cut off, incrementally harming China's steel exports.\n\nWhy would Chinese-exposed stocks go up on that news? Likely, investors believe the new trade restrictions may spur China's leaders to increase domestic stimulus to consumers, making up lost industrial revenue with domestic consumption. Of note, there are key political meetings coming up in March, in which additional stimulus measures could be announced.\n\nIncreased consumer spending in China would obviously benefit e-commerce leader Alibaba, as well as Nike and Estee Lauder. Nike derived over 15% of its revenue from China in fiscal 2024, and Estee Lauder's stock has recently been decimated by a downturn in Chinese makeup sales. At its peak in 2021, China accounted for 34% of Estee Lauder's revenue, before the business segment descended into a severe multiyear decline.\n\nEstee Lauder and Nike are also coming off especially bad weeks, with Nike receiving an analyst downgrade on Friday, and Estee Lauder plunging following its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. So, it's perhaps not a surprise to see each bouncing back off recent lows today.\n\nAlibaba may also be benefiting from increased optimism for Chinese tech stocks following the unveiling of DeepSeek's R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model last month, which sent shockwaves through the global artificial intelligence industry. DeepSeek seemed to reinvigorate sentiment around the competitive prowess of Chinese technology firms.\n\nNot to be outdone, Alibaba also has a family of open-source AI models on the market named \"Qwen,\" and there was additional positive news around Qwen AI models today. According to the South China Post, researchers at Stanford and Berkeley published a paper claiming they have produced a new AI reasoning model for just $50 using Alibaba's Qwen2.5-32b-Instruct model as the \"base\" model. Like DeepSeek, Qwen models are open-source, which allows outside parties and researchers to access the model's weights. According to the researchers, their new model bested OpenAI's o1-preview on math and programming skills. While OpenAI is already out with its next o3 reasoning models today, building a competitive model to the recent prior generation for just $50 is notable.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what financial benefit Alibaba may reap from others training reasoning models with its open-source technology. But the fact that the Chinese tech giant is offering competitive AI models was enough to boost sentiment today.\n\nChina's stocks could boom or bust\n\nComing out of a multiyear downturn, Chinese stocks have risen over the past year on hopes for significant stimulus from the government. While new measures have been announced and officials have pledged to do what it takes to get growth going again, some analysts have remained skeptical, as the government has eschewed direct subsidies to consumers for more indirect infrastructure stimulus and lower interest rates.\n\nStill, leading Chinese tech stocks trade at much lower valuations than their U.S. counterparts, and China-exposed consumer discretionary stocks like Nike and Estee Lauder have been decimated. Certainly, Trump's election could also flame tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nBut if the recovery continues and the government delivers more powerful stimulus measures in March, there could be a continued recovery for these stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Alibaba Stock Surges Amid Positive Earnings And AI Developments With strong earnings, strategic investments, and analyst confidence, Alibaba's future looks bright.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has demonstrated notable resilience and growth amid fluctuated market conditions, recently capturing attention with significant stock performances and strategic developments. The Chinese e-commerce giant\u2019s shares climbed impressively, echoing positive investor sentiment as they opened the week with substantial gains.\n\nThis upward momentum saw Alibaba\u2019s stock soar by 5.90%, closing at HKD 105.90 ($13.60) during Hong Kong trading and increasing its year-to-date gains to 30.26%. Investors have been particularly focused on the company\u2019s upcoming third-quarter earnings report, as well as advancements within its artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The launch of the Qwen2.5-VL, which is said to be capable of parsing files, analyzing videos, and controlling PCs, showcases Alibaba\u2019s competitive edge. Notably, the AI model has outperformed industry counterparts such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash.\n\nOn the U.S. exchange, the stock closed at $103.51, reflecting a daily increase of 3.13%. Despite minor fluctuations during after-hours trading\u2014down 0.26%\u2014Alibaba's overall stock performance has drawn interest from various analysts and market traders.\n\nA significant factor influencing investor confidence came from market speculations surrounding Alibaba\u2019s potential investment strategies. Reports circulated indicating plans for the company to acquire a 10% stake in DeepSeek for $1 billion, raising the valuation of DeepSeek to approximately $10 billion. While these rumors sparked considerable excitement, they were swiftly addressed by Alibaba's Vice President, Yan Qiao, who declared the circulating investment information as false. Nevertheless, this did not entirely quell analyst speculation about possible future collaborations between the two companies.\n\nFurther supporting Alibaba's stock performance, several Wall Street analysts have weighed in with favorable ratings and price targets. Benchmark reaffirmed its \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a price target of $118.00, reflecting optimism about the company\u2019s potential growth. Similarly, Mizuho raised its target from $92.00 to $113.00 and Citigroup adjusted its target from $133.00 to $138.00, all the more illustrating the positive outlook for Alibaba.\n\nThe consensus among analysts leans toward \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d with the average price target set at $115.86, based on growing sentiment toward the company as plans for growth and technological advancements materialize. The recent earnings report also reinforced this optimistic view. On November 15, Alibaba reported earnings per share (EPS) of $15.06, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.87 by $13.19. This report stated revenue of $236.50 billion, just shy of analyst expectations of $239.45 billion, yet signifying a 5.2% increase year-over-year, illuminating the company\u2019s recovery path following economic challenges.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock performance is noteworthy when put alongside the hedging strategies employed by investment giants such as Michael Burry. The famed investor, known for his contrarian investment strategies, has shown interest in undervalued Chinese firms, which includes notable holdings within Alibaba. Burry's investment approach often amplifies market performance for these stocks, illustrating investor confidence in the face of regulatory and economic pressures influencing the Chinese market.\n\nDespite skepticism from certain market watchers, primarily due to China\u2019s economic adjustments and regulatory environment, the response to recent government stimulus has borne fruit. The CSI 300 Index, reflecting the nation\u2019s equity benchmark, ascended by 32% following the Chinese government\u2019s economic measures aimed at reviving market confidence.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba's fundamentals reveal strong growth potential with its current ratio of 1.37, which suggests effective short-term financial health. This is complemented by its beta of 0.31 and low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.16, indicating stable operation within volatile market conditions.\n\nInvestors and market analysts alike continue to monitor the developments closely, with attention drawn to Alibaba\u2019s strategic investments and partnerships. The discussion surrounding recent earnings reports and technological advancements aligns with broader trends seeking opportunities for growth against the backdrop of economic recovery. The future seems promising for Alibaba, particularly as its advancements create competitive advantages within increasingly saturated markets.\n\nOverall, Alibaba Group Holding Limited stands out against the backdrop of its recent stock performance and strategic maneuvers, showcasing resilience and promising growth potential. Investors' interest, buoyed by recent developments and analyst ratings, positions Alibaba favorably as it seeks to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the current economic climate.",

Tech, consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy were all off more than 2%.\n\nThe brisk retreat in the benchmark index over the past two sessions has the hallmarks of a momentum unwind catalyzed by Walmart\u2019s lackluster outlook: the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF fell nearly twice as much as the S&P 500 in the final couple trading days of the week. Walmart, for its part, extended yesterday\u2019s losses to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time since August.\n\nFlows related to this month\u2019s options expiry may have played a role in the magnitude of the downdraft.\n\nNvidia, for instance, had a significant amount of open interest in calls expiring on Friday with a strike price of $140. While the stock opened around that level, the value of those contracts plummeted as shares dipped lower, likely exacerbating the selling pressure on the stock.\n\nA few bright spots on the tape: Celsius spiked after announcing a deal to buy Alani Nu, which is popular among Gen Z. It\u2019s a day ending in y, so Alibaba rallied strongly, this time on reports that GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen upped his stake in the Chinese e-commerce and cloud giant to about $1 billion.\n\nHims & Hers cratered after the FDA said weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy are no longer in a shortage, which curbs its ability to sell copycat editions. The news was a boon for Novo Nordisk, however.\n\nLuxury reseller The RealReal also plummeted after issuing full-year forecasts for revenues and adjusted EBITDA that came in light relative to analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nProbes also weighed on certain companies\u2019 shares to end the week. UnitedHealth sold off on a report that the DOJ is investigating its Medicare billing practices. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike is reportedly under scrutiny by both the DOJ and SEC.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other Michael Burry's top stock picks.\n\nLegendary investor Michael Burry is best known for his contrarian strategies that often outperform the overall market. Burry is famous for having foreseen the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred from 2007 to 2010. He shorted the mortgage bond market, making $800 million for himself and his investors.\n\nWhile he made a name for himself at the height of the financial crisis in 2007, the legendary investor has built a reputation on Wall Street on his ability to identify and invest in market-beating opportunities. His recent actions demonstrate a trend toward high-conviction investments in cheap, market-leading businesses.\n\nREAD ALSO: 9 Best Augmented Reality Stocks to Invest in Under $10 and 12 High Growth Low PE Stocks to Buy.\n\n\u201cDr. Burry\u2019s one of those investors who doesn\u2019t just follow the crowd,\u201d says Edward Corona, a market trader and publisher of The Options Oracle Newsletter. \u201cHe\u2019s a true contrarian, digging deep into the numbers and spotting opportunities others might miss.\u201d\n\nChina is one market in which the legendary investor is taking a keen interest, going by holdings in Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund he established in 2013. While the investment fund focuses on long-term capital appreciation, it also targets undervalued or misunderstood investment opportunities. That\u2019s evident given that Burry\u2019s biggest holdings are Chinese internet giants that have been battered in recent years amid a slowdown in the Chinese economy due to heightened regulatory pressure.\n\nThe changes in Scion Asset management came as Beijing stepped up its attempts to boost economic growth while putting breaks to regulatory pressure. Although the unexpected stimulus plan caused a wild surge in Chinese stocks, some market watchers are still wary of the industry\u2019s long-term prospects. The CSI 300 Index, the nation\u2019s equity benchmark, rose 32% in just two weeks following Beijing\u2019s stimulus measures.\n\nDespite identifying as a value investor, Burry tends to jump in and out of positions frequently rather than hold his stocks for an extended period. That was evident as he exited his position in a real estate company in the third quarter on concerns that the sector would capitulate amid high interest rates. His most significant action during the third quarter was selling all of his shares in a real estate investment trust (REIT) in Los Angeles. He used the money he received to hedge against potential losses on some of the company\u2019s biggest investments.\n\nStory Continues",

From China\u2019s DeepSeek to the West\u2019s AI race, artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool \u2014 it is an omnipresent force shaping global surveillance, economic power structures, and the future of digital autonomy. As AI systems become more advanced and widely available \u2014 often for free or at a fraction of the cost \u2014 what is their real value and if AI developers are the ones truly benefitting, what does that mean for the rest of us?\n\nRead More: The Influence of AI in the Interior Design Industry\n\nIs The West Losing The AI Race?\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek, which recently took Silicon Valley by surprise and became one of the most downloaded apps in the United States has raised security concerns due to a \u201chidden code\u201d that allegedly transmits user data to the Chinese government, according to cybersecurity experts. Researchers from Feroot Security, a Canada-based cybersecurity firm, discovered that DeepSeek\u2019s browser-based version not only collects user information but also generates a unique digital \u201cfingerprint\u201d to track activity across multiple websites.\n\nRead More: The Influence of AI in the Interior Design Industry\n\nLaunched in January 2025 as a free, open-source platform, DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech industry, triggering over USD 1 trillion in stock market losses and threatening the dominance of U.S. leaders such as Nvidia. Its sudden rise has cast doubt on the perceived dominance of well-funded U.S. AI companies like OpenAI, which has reportedly invested billions in similar technologies. As the South China Morning Post reports, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek rose to worldwide fame last month after it released the V3 large language model (LLM) and R1 reasoning model, which the company said showed capabilities comparable to products from ChatGPT creator OpenAI, despite being developed at significantly lower costs. DeepSeek was founded by entrepreneur and businessman Liang Feng in 2023. By offering an advanced AI tool for free \u2014 despite its relatively low reported development costs \u2014 DeepSeek is reported to have unsettled Silicon Valley and challenged assumptions about American leadership in the AI space.\n\nThe AI landscape is no longer a Silicon Valley monopoly as for years, Silicon Valley dictated the pace of AI development, but that dominance is slipping. The rise of Chinese firms \u2014 particularly DeepSeek \u2014 has accelerated global competition, leading to an unprecedented shift in technological power. No longer is the race confined to a handful of Western tech giants \u2014 now, Eastern AI firms are outpacing them in speed, efficiency, and sophistication.\n\nDespite DeepSeek\u2019s rise, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta continue to \u201cpour billions into artificial intelligence\u201d. The report states that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms are projected to collectively invest over USD 215 billion in capital expenditures for their current fiscal years, marking an annual rise of more than 45 percent. Meanwhile, Amazon.com \u2014 while withholding a full-year forecast \u2014 indicated that its total capex across various divisions is set to exceed USD 100 billion, with the bulk of this increase being directed towards AI development.\n\nThese figures reflect the growing intensity of the AI race, despite investor concerns surrounding the influence of China\u2019s DeepSeek and the uncertainty over whether these major U.S. firms will see a return on their massive investments. Investors are particularly unsettled by DeepSeek\u2019s ability to replicate much of the functionality of leading American AI systems, all while spending less and utilising fewer, less powerful chips, as claimed by its Chinese creators. However, U.S. company leaders remain confident, highlighting their own technological progress and arguing that reduced costs will drive AI adoption and boost demand for cloud services, which AI heavily relies on to function.\n\nSo why do Western AI models struggle with inferential reasoning compared to their Eastern counterparts? AI development in countries like Russia and China often take a more centralised, state-backed strategy. This support includes access to vast amounts of data and resources, which can help hone the models to specific needs, including advanced reasoning. Western companies may not have the same access to data and government-driven initiatives that prioritise AI development.\n\nThen there is the discussion of public versus private sector approaches. Different countries are taking varied approaches to AI regulation, with the public and private sectors playing distinct roles. In China, for instance, the government leads AI development, driving a centralised strategy that ensures national interests are prioritised. In contrast, the West follows a more fragmented, market-driven approach, where tech giants hold significant sway. This highlights how each model presents its own set of challenges and opportunities for growth and governance in the AI rat race.\n\nThe Future of Language Models\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s latest iteration has redefined the limits of AI-powered assistants. Unlike standard chatbots, which rely on predefined responses, DeepSeek anticipates user needs before they even ask. It analyses past interactions, contextual nuances, and even subconscious patterns to refine its responses. Unlike ChatGPT, which still struggles with complex inferential reasoning, DeepSeek has developed a more sophisticated approach \u2014 one that does not just respond but understands intent between the lines. This raises a critical question: while Western AI models prioritise accessibility and ethical constraints, Eastern firms are refining AI to a near-intuitive level. Will this give them a strategic advantage? And what does this level of sophistication mean for privacy and control? However, despite once being a frontrunner in advanced AI models, DeepSeek has now been dethroned by an even more sophisticated competitor in Alibaba.\n\nAccording to a report by USA Today, Alibaba\u2019s release of its Qwen 2.5-Max artificial intelligence model on the first day of the Lunar New Year highlights the intense pressure exerted by DeepSeek\u2019s recent success. Qwen 2.5-Max \u2014 according to Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit \u2014 surpasses both DeepSeek-V3 and other leading models like GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-405B in performance. This move follows DeepSeek\u2019s disruptive impact, particularly after its DeepSeek-V2 model, which triggered a price war in China by being open-source and exceptionally low-cost. In response, Chinese firms like ByteDance, Baidu, and Tencent have quickly updated their own models to stay competitive, further intensifying the AI arms race within China and globally.\n\nRead More: The OpenAI Debate and the Ramification of Improper AI Governance\n\nAI is already shaping human behaviour in ways most people do not realise. From a commercial aspect with AI-written books and deepfake models used for branded commercials to automated journalism, artificial intelligence is not just assisting creativity \u2014 it is replacing it. The question is no longer whether AI will generate content but whether we will be able to distinguish human work from machine-generated output.\n\nMost users engage with AI tools without realising they are feeding them data \u2014 data that becomes fuel for even more advanced learning systems. Governments and corporations are increasingly aware of AI\u2019s power, leading to rising restrictions and tighter control. AI\u2019s presence is often unseen \u2014 tracking, predicting, and influencing decisions without users\u2019 explicit awareness.\n\nThe rise of AI platforms like DeepSeek has sparked new conversations around digital sovereignty. With AI models and data being controlled by a select group of tech giants, the question of who owns and governs digital resources becomes ever more pressing. As seen with the United States\u2019 Silicon Valley, nations that develop and control their own AI technology may gain unprecedented power, influencing global economic and political dynamics.\n\nRead More: Is Cinema Preparing for An AI Takeover?\n\nAI Agents and the Erosion of Human-Centric Intelligence\n\nWith Oracle debuting its AI agents, the next phase of the AI race is here. These self-learning systems are not just programmed to respond; they adapt, evolve, and outthink human-driven decisions. The race is not about creating better chatbots \u2014 it is about who can build AI systems that function independently of human intervention. DeepSeek\u2019s latest model faced immediate restrictions from hundreds of companies and government agencies. A newly proposed law in the U.S. could impose hefty fines or even prison sentences on individuals who use the Chinese AI app DeepSeek.\n\nThe bill \u2014 introduced by Republican Senator Josh Hawley \u2014 seeks to ban U.S. citizens from contributing to the advancement of artificial intelligence technology in China. It also aims to restrict the importation of AI-related technology or intellectual property developed within the country. If passed, the legislation would enforce strict penalties, including fines of up to USD 1 million for individuals and as much as USD 100 million for businesses. Those found in violation could also face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAI As a Force of Good\n\nIt is not all doom and gloom, despite the fear-mongering surrounding AI, its real impact is already proving to be transformative. From streamlining business operations to ensuring fairer decision-making in industries like insurance and governance, AI is stepping in where human limitations exist. Rather than a threat, AI could be the key to a more efficient, equitable, and forward-thinking world. One such argument is that AI is not replacing human intelligence but rather amplifying it.\n\nInsurance, healthcare and the finance industry could benefit from some element of AI intervention. With insurance, AI can be used to analyse patterns in claims to identify potential fraud while AI-powered automation could speed up claims approvals, reducing paperwork and human errors. As it stands, chatbots already handle routine inquiries, AI could make machine learning models assess customer data to offer personalised policies, improve efficiency and reduce wait times. From the administration angle, AI could reduce paperwork and improve patient data management within the healthcare sector while AI-driven models can predict stock market trends and optimise trading strategies within finance and banking. AI has the potential to meet growing demands that are no longer humanly possible to fulfill at a large scale. AI also has the potential to eliminate human biases in vetting processes, from loans to medical diagnostics. AI automated systems could ensure consistency and prevent human errors or prejudices alongside faster, data-driven decisions that benefit businesses and consumers alike.\n\nAGI stands for artificial general intelligence and refers to machines that are able to apply their knowledge and learning ability to a wide range of tasks. Most AI today is \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cspecialised\u201d and designed for specific tasks. True generalised AI will have the capacity to think, act and behave far more closely to the way we do across tasks involving creativity and complex problem-solving.\n\nPublic Over Profit \u2013 Cost, Control, Complexity\n\nInstead of resisting AI, embracing it for good could be the biggest opportunity of our generation. The real failure is not AI \u2014 it is the lack of vision on how it is implemented. Smart systems are helping governments make better infrastructure and policy decisions. The debate of AI ethics has been ongoing for decades and it is time to focus on solutions instead of fueling paranoia. AI is not the problem \u2014 how we choose to use (or misuse) it is.\n\nRead More: For Better or Worse: Here Is How AI Artist Botto is Reshaping the Art Industry\n\nThe AI race is no longer about innovation alone \u2014 it is about control. With each advancement, AI developers are not just creating better tools; they are designing systems that learn from us, adapt, and evolve. While AI is being given away for free or at minimal cost, the real currency is data, influence, and power. There should also be some importance placed on having diverse teams in AI development as AI systems are shaped by the biases and perspectives of those who create them. Without a diverse group of developers, there is a risk that AI may perpetuate social inequalities or missed opportunities for more inclusive solutions.\n\nThe real failure is not the implementation of AI itself but rather the profit-driven rush to dominate it. It is a scene all too familiar \u2014 when left unchecked, technological advancements prioritise corporate gains over public good. Governments should have systems in place to ensure AI serves society, not just those who control it. Yet, this has been an ongoing discussion for at least the last 30 years or so \u2014 warning of automation, bias, and unchecked surveillance \u2014 only to find ourselves repeating the same cycle.\n\nFor more on the latest in business reads, click here.",

            "content": "In the last weeks of 2024, there were a number of rumours that Cainiao, Alibaba\u2019s logistics affiliate, would go through a \u201cmassive restructuring\u201d. A few ecommerce and logistics experts in the Momentum Works community had also discussed the potential impact on Alibaba\u2019s domestic and international ecommerce businesses.\n\nIn January, media in China revealed that Cainiao was indeed going through some \u2018adjustment\u2019. The objective was \u201cto become a real logistics company, one that focused on logistics operations\u201d. Judging from the tone of the report, the media probably obtained an official but unannounced version of Cainiao\u2019s restructuring.\n\nIn detail, the 400 people team in Cainiao International that was servicing AliExpress (Alibaba\u2019s cross border ecommerce platform) would be transitioned to newly-integrated Alibaba Ecommerce Business Group. Ding Hongwei, the Cainiao executive in charge of this team, now reports to both Jiang Fan, CEO of Alibaba Ecommerce and Wan Lin, CEO of Cainiao.\n\nWan Lin, CEO of Cainiao\n\nIn addition, both domestic supply chain solutions and e-waybills teams would be handed over to Taobao and Tmall Group, which manages Alibaba\u2019s domestic ecommerce platforms.\n\nA Brief History of Cainiao\n\nCainiao Smart Logistics Network was founded in 2013 as Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm. Over the years, it has grown into a comprehensive logistics group with businesses including smart logistics solutions, warehouses and logistics asset management, as well as one of China\u2019s largest pudo (pick-up/drop-off) networks \u2013 Cainiao Stations (\u83dc\u9e1f\u9a7f\u7ad9).\n\nA Typical Cainiao Station\n\nCainiao also has developed a global network, promising the ability of 5 days delivery to anywhere in the world.\n\nIn 2023, amid Alibaba\u2019s restructuring into \u201c1+6+N\u201d, Cainiao was spun off as an independent group and filed for IPO. The company unveiled a wealth of data during the process \u2013 read Momentum Works report: Cainiao: Highlights of IPO prospectus for more details. However, the market sentiment was not positive back then, and the plan for IPO was eventually abandoned.\n\nA key issue that arose during the process is Cainiao\u2019s relationship with the various Alibaba ecommerce platforms: Taobao, Tmall, AliExpress, Lazada etc. If Cainiao\u2019s logistics services remained independent of Alibaba platforms with its own P&L and platforms as a major customer, there would inevitably be some internal conflicts.\n\nWhile Cainiao aimed to be profitable as an independent logistics entity, its primary customers\u2014Alibaba\u2019s own platforms\u2014were focused on optimizing their logistics costs to maintain competitive pricing for consumers and merchants. This tension created inefficiencies, as Cainiao had to balance the need to generate revenue with the strategic demands of Alibaba\u2019s broader e-commerce ecosystem.\n\nThe restructuring directly addresses this issue. By integrating Cainiao\u2019s e-commerce-related logistics services into Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce divisions, the company may eliminate the friction of competing priorities. In the near future, logistics operations supporting Taobao, Tmall, and AliExpress will be directly aligned with their respective business goals, removing the need for Cainiao to function as an external vendor negotiating service fees with its largest clients.\n\nThis transformation positions Cainiao as a true logistics company, allowing it to operate with a clearer strategic mandate. Rather than functioning as a semi-autonomous service provider within Alibaba\u2019s ecosystem, Cainiao can now concentrate on scaling its logistics assets, improving operational efficiency, and expanding its global reach. This is particularly crucial as Cainiao continues investing in cross-border logistics and international markets, where its ability to offer competitive and scalable solutions will define its success.\n\nCainiao\u2019s restructuring is also a crucial step in Alibaba\u2019s broader effort to refine its corporate structure and financial priorities. As noted in Momentum Works Transforming Alibaba Report, \u201cMost of the time, change is tough and difficult to execute. In the shoes of Alibaba, a large and highly complex organisation, this transformation would be a hugely challenging but necessary step to regain its vigour (and market share) amid a new environment.\u201d\n\nFor Alibaba\u2014and for any corporation\u2014change is the only constant. The company has successfully adapted before, but with intensifying competition and shifting market dynamics, this latest transformation will be a formidable test of Alibaba\u2019s ability to retain its leading position in China\u2019s e-commerce and logistics landscape.",

However, Alibaba also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nAlibaba's dividend yield is currently 2.03%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $2.66 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $295 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $10,957 and $295, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $11,252. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Alibaba stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 12.52%.

If it\u2019s got an electric motor and a funky shape, I\u2019m down to clown. But being an electric bicycle guy through and through, anytime we can work some good ol\u2019 pedaling action into the mix, I\u2019m all the happier. And this week\u2019s edition of the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week sure tickles my fancy!\n\nIf Teslas are too mainstream for you, but Fred Flinstone\u2019s car is a bit too much effort, then I think I\u2019ve found the perfect compromise. This electric bike-car offers everything its name promises.\n\nIt\u2019s got pedals like a bike, along with a set of handlebars for steering and a bicycle seat for keeping you the perfect amount of uncomfortable. But it\u2019s also got the enclosed convenience of a car, shielding riders from the rain and sun, though not from the curious looks of passersby. And with an electric bicycle motor, you don\u2019t have to burn through your entire lunch just pedaling this brick down the block.\n\nOf course, beauty is always in the eye of the beholder. And I\u2019m sure the appearance will be divisive, with some finding it charming and others\u2026 less so. But more than just looks, this thing is about utility.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nI\u2019d say the design is perfect for anyone who has ever said, \u201cGive me the environmental friendliness of an electric bicycle but with the turning radius of a school bus.\u201d Finally, a vehicle that lets you feel superior to cyclists and drivers simultaneously while enjoying the camaraderie of neither.\n\nCombining the aerodynamics of a garden shed and the aesthetics of a cute dumpster, this electric bike car is likely as hard to get rolling as it is to park. But it\u2019s got one main thing going for it: an insane amount of enclosed storage space that other e-bikes could only dream of.\n\nBehind those double doors is your own mobile storage unit, and one that has every right to use the bicycle lane \u2013 at least in cities that extend such rights to four-wheeled bicycles.\n\nTo put numbers on it, this thing offers a massive 1.8 cubic meters of storage space in back. I\u2019m not sure the best way to describe that in freedom units. Does 63 cubic feet mean anything to anyone? 475 gallons? A micro-studio apartment in NYC?\n\nEither way, you could just about turn the rear box into a tiny camper \u2013 though it wouldn\u2019t be the first bicycle-based RV we\u2019ve seen.\n\nAs far as performance goes, it\u2019s got a top speed of 31 km/h, or a hair under 20 mph. Considering it probably has the crash-test rating of a cardboard box, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go that fast too often.\n\nThe benefit of crashing on a standard bicycle is you get to separate from it fairly quickly. Crashing in this thing makes me feel like I\u2019d just pinball around inside the cab until I\u2019ve become one with the handlebars.\n\nOf course, the ideal environment for something like this electric bike-car is not mixing it up with traffic. I\u2019d much rather stick to the bike lane or bicycle highways \u2013 though I\u2019m not sure how my fellow cyclists would welcome me there. Actually, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d even consider me a fellow cyclist.\n\nSo alas, I\u2019m not sure exactly where I\u2019d use it. And at $3,000, that\u2019s a hefty chunk of change for a vehicle that would have a hard time fitting into our world. But even though its place is hard to understand, I\u2019ll forever love that things like this exist.\n\nJust please don\u2019t go and try to buy something like this from Alibaba. Yes, I know I\u2019m not a good example and rarely take my own advice. But this is a, \u201cdo what I say, not what I do\u201d situation, indeed.",

With these high-performance bikes usually costing up to $6,000 from official retailers, Rozzy couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. But with the red flags of online shopping looming, he took every precaution before hitting that buy button.\n\nFeeling the weight of uncertainty, he meticulously searched for verified vendors to safeguard his investment. Aware that Alibaba would hold the cash until the bike was shipped, he felt a small sense of security\u2014but still fretted over potential scams or shipping mishaps as the delivery window stretched for three long months.\n\nAs the days rolled by, anxiety crept in. Would this e-bike actually arrive? With each passing moment, Rozzy wished he\u2019d opted for the certainty of an official retailer, where tracking and speedy delivery are mere norms.\n\nFinally, the moment of truth arrived! Unwrapping the bike, he was greeted with pure delight: it was in brilliant condition, decked out with official branding and exuding a sleek, sturdy presence. The risk had paid off, revealing a deal of a lifetime.\n\nThe key takeaway? Sometimes, taking a leap of faith can land you a treasure. So, could your next great deal be just a click away? Dive into the world of possibilities\u2014but always stay vigilant!\n\nDiscover the Unexpected Risks and Rewards of Buying E-Bikes Online!\n\nUnveiling the E-Bike Purchase Experience\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce, the story of Rozzy and his budget-friendly Sur-Ron e-bike is a cautionary tale filled with excitement and apprehension. As he navigated the murky waters of online buying, several critical aspects of purchasing high-end e-bikes online emerged that are worth exploring.\n\nKey Features of Sur-Ron E-Bikes\n\nSur-Ron e-bikes are not just about aesthetics; they boast impressive specifications that appeal to a wide range of riders. Here are some key features:\n\n\u2013 Powerful Battery: Sur-Ron e-bikes typically come equipped with a 60V lithium battery, allowing for a range of approximately 40 to 60 miles on a single charge.\n\n\u2013 High Speed: These bikes can reach speeds up to 47 mph, providing an exhilarating riding experience.\n\n\u2013 Lightweight Frame: Made from aluminum alloy, the bikes are lightweight yet sturdy, enabling better maneuverability.\n\n\u2013 Off-Road Capabilities: With high ground clearance and strong suspension systems, Sur-Ron bikes are built for rough terrains.\n\nUse Cases and Limitations\n\nUse Cases:\n\n\u2013 Commuting: Ideal for urban riding, offering an eco-friendly alternative to cars.\n\n\u2013 Recreational Use: Perfect for those who enjoy outdoor adventures and off-roading experiences.\n\nLimitations:\n\n\u2013 Cost: While Rozzy scored a deal, the act of buying may involve hidden costs such as shipping, customs, and potential maintenance needs.\n\n\u2013 Availability and Support: Purchasing from unofficial sources can create challenges in terms of warranty and customer support.\n\nMarket Trends and Innovations\n\nThe e-bike market is experiencing rapid growth. According to recent market forecasts, the global e-bike market is expected to reach $39.9 billion by 2027. Innovations in battery technology, integration of smart technology, and an increasing focus on sustainability are driving this expansion.\n\nPricing Insights\n\nOn platforms like Alibaba, Sur-Ron e-bikes may be listed as low as $4,000, significantly below retail pricing. Comparatively, authorized dealers often charge between $5,000 to $6,500, which means buyers could save a substantial amount by sourcing from alternative outlets. However, the risk of scams and the lack of after-sale support should not be overlooked.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1. What should I consider before buying an e-bike from an online marketplace?\n\n\u2013 Always check for vendor ratings, look for verified seller badges, and read customer reviews. Ensure there\u2019s a return policy, and be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true.\n\n2. How does the warranty work for e-bikes purchased from unofficial retailers?\n\n\u2013 Warranties may vary greatly. Often, manufacturers may not honor warranties for bikes purchased through unauthorized sellers. It\u2019s crucial to confirm warranty details before making a purchase.\n\n3. What are the safety regulations regarding e-bikes?\n\n\u2013 E-bike regulations vary by region, with some requiring registration and insurance. Be sure to familiarize yourself with local laws regarding usage and classification (class 1, 2, or 3).\n\nExplore More\n\nFor insightful articles on e-bike technology and purchases, check out these resources: Eco Cycling.\n\nIn summary, Rozzy\u2019s experience demonstrates the thrilling yet precarious nature of online shopping for high-end e-bikes. Embrace the adventure, but be armed with knowledge to make informed decisions!",

            "content": "Can you backdoor invest in DeepSeek by buying Alibaba stock? Alibaba says \"no.\"\n\nAlibaba (BABA 5.72%) stock jumped more than 7% in early trading on the NYSE Friday, before turning tail and giving back nearly half its gains. As of 11:05 a.m. ET, shares of the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant are still up 4.1%. The question now is:\n\nDoes Alibaba stock deserve to stay up even this much? Because today's wild ride in Alibaba stock appears to derive entirely from competing rumors regarding Chinese artificial intelligence wunderkind DeepSeek.\n\nBig news (or no news?) in China\n\nYou'll recall that DeepSeek roiled stock markets across the U.S. last week, after rolling out R1 and V3 large language models that appear able to outperform the best LLMs that OpenAI, Anthropic, and even Alphabet have to offer.\n\nWell, Chinese investors noticed that, too. It wasn't long before Alibaba unveiled an artificial intelligence product of its own that it said \"surpasses DeepSeek's AI model across various benchmarks.\" A few days later, Alibaba changed tacks and began hosting DeepSeek on its own cloud servers. And now today, multiple Chinese news outlets have reported that Alibaba is planning to invest $1 billion of its own money into DeepSeek!\n\nThere's just one wrinkle: According to a Reuters report just filed, Alibaba is denying the rumors. Quoting \"Chinese news outlet The Paper,\" and Alibaba VP Yan Qiao therein, Reuters says \"news circulating that Alibaba will invest in DeepSeek is fake news.\"\n\nIs Alibaba stock a buy?\n\nSo where does this leave Alibaba investors? Assume Alibaba's veep is being above board, and not simply playing word games (e.g., if Alibaba has already invested in DeepSeek, then news that it will invest might be untrue). In that case, you probably can't backdoor invest into privately owned DeepSeek by buying shares of Alibaba -- which is presumably the hope that drove Alibaba stock higher today.\n\nYou still can own Alibaba itself, however. And at a valuation of 20 times earnings, and barely 16 times free cash flow, and with long-term growth projected at 18.5% annually, that might not be a bad idea.",

While these are leaving a lot of uncertainty across the economy and other companies that have shown weaker stances in their most recent quarterly earnings, one question is still left unanswered.\n\nAlibaba Group Today BABA Alibaba Group $143.67 +7.70 (+5.66%) 52-Week Range $68.36 \u25bc $145.30 Dividend Yield 0.68% P/E Ratio 20.76 Price Target $131.93 Add to Watchlist\n\nThat is, whether these tariffs will affect overseas stocks similarly to how they have affected United States stocks so far. There is now a particular focus on Chinese stocks and Asia\u2019s powerhouse economy. The reality is that these tariffs will most likely affect China\u2019s trade volume with the United States; however, not all companies will be terribly affected by this issue.\n\nGet Alibaba Group alerts: Sign Up\n\nWhen it comes to the country\u2019s technology sector, the concern is more about whether data from American citizens is being accessed by these Chinese firms, as seen by the recent debacles in the TikTok platform. But here\u2019s where investors can feel safe: Alibaba Group NYSE: BABA not only offers a great risk-to-reward ratio as a safety, but also its broadly international consumer business and cloud computing branches allow it to mitigate the impacts these tariffs could have.\n\nAlibaba Stock\u2019s Risk-to-Reward Ratio\n\nEven though the stock has recovered to as much as 85% of its 52-week high, Alibaba stock is still behind its American counterparts. Investors can see this through shares of Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, and even Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN.\n\nAfter a pretty steep earnings decline in some of these American technology stocks, they are still trading within 10% of their 52-week highs, not to mention close to their all-time highs. Alibaba\u2019s all-time high price is just over $300 a share, so comparing these two sets of companies can lead investors to one conclusion.\n\nThat conclusion is that Alibaba still holds one of the most favorable risk-to-reward ratios in the global technology market, one that has attracted some of Wall Street\u2019s best investors in recent quarters. Right now, both Michael Burry and David Tepper hold Alibaba as their largest position in their respective portfolios, and there\u2019s a reason for that.\n\nRelative Immunity to Tariffs\n\nAlibaba does a lot of business in the United States, where customers often buy from AliExpress due to the relatively cheaper offers and bulk business model. However, the company is also strongly positioned across Asia and the Middle East, even in Europe and Latin America.\n\nThat means that although tariffs might affect consumer buying trends from Alibaba, overall, it will be a small dent in the company\u2019s bottom line and volumes. More than that, Alibaba is much more than a retail and wholesale company; it has its hands on the growth of cloud computing in these nations as well.\n\nWith the recent DeepSeek and NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA debacle, it\u2019s not too far-fetched for investors to imagine a world where Alibaba provides DeepSeek and other artificial intelligence platforms with the infrastructure to develop and train these models.\n\nAcross Asia and other locations, Alibaba has also set up shop via data centers. If Amazon\u2019s success can be attributed to having access to consumer data, allowing for trend and taste discovery, then Alibaba can take that model to a much bigger scale. And yet, current valuations reflect none of these bullish factors.\n\nUnbelievable Discounts for Alibaba Stock\n\nWith this in mind, investors can look to Alibaba\u2019s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.8x today as a steep discount to its American peers, who are valued at a 23.4x P/E average. Not only were Burry and Tepper willing to buy into this discount, but other market players also shared their optimism.\n\nAlibaba Group MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 84th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 8.2% Downside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Weak Environmental Score N/A News Sentiment 0.79 Insider Trading N/A Proj. Earnings Growth 18.19% See Full Analysis\n\nAnalysts from Citigroup, for example, decided to reiterate their Buy rating on Alibaba stock as of January 2025, this time placing a $138 per share valuation on it. From today\u2019s low level, this new valuation would call for up to 37.5% upside, giving investors one of the best plays to navigate this new tariff volatility.\n\nUltimately, the company\u2019s management also understands just how cheap this business is today. Through a $25 billion stock buyback program, the company insiders are sending a message to the entire market. Buying back what would be worth 11% of the company\u2019s market capitalization is a bold statement to indicate how cheap Alibaba is today.\n\nAll told, tariffs don\u2019t look like they will impact much of Alibaba\u2019s business, which is heavily discounted in valuation multiples compared to how much it can grow in the coming years.\n\nBefore you consider Alibaba Group, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Alibaba Group wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Alibaba Group currently has a \"Moderate Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Tech, consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy were all off more than 2%.\n\nThe brisk retreat in the benchmark index over the past two sessions has the hallmarks of a momentum unwind catalyzed by Walmart\u2019s lackluster outlook: the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF fell nearly twice as much as the S&P 500 in the final couple trading days of the week. Walmart, for its part, extended yesterday\u2019s losses to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time since August.\n\nFlows related to this month\u2019s options expiry may have played a role in the magnitude of the downdraft.\n\nNvidia, for instance, had a significant amount of open interest in calls expiring on Friday with a strike price of $140.

The achievement marks a significant milestone as Qwen 2.5 Max has emerged as the top-ranked non-reasoning model from China in prominent benchmarking and ranking platforms.\n\nAccording to reports from Chinese media outlets including Securities Times and ITHome, Qwen 2.5 Max utilizes a large-scale mixture of experts (MoE) architecture, trained on over 20 trillion tokens. In comparison, DeepSeek's V3 model also employs an MoE architecture but is trained on 14.8 trillion tokens. This difference in training data volume is significant, as models trained on datasets with a higher number of tokens tend to perform better.\n\nCompetitive performance against global leaders\n\nData released by Alibaba indicates that Qwen 2.5 Max demonstrates comparable capabilities to DeepSeek's V3, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and OpenAI's GPT-4 across various benchmarks, including foundational knowledge, programming, and overall assessment capabilities.\n\nRising prominence in global rankings\n\nAs reported by The South China Morning Post, data from the Chatbot Arena testing platform developed by computer scientists at UC Berkeley shows that Qwen 2.5 Max reached seventh place on the platform's leaderboard during the Lunar New Year period, becoming the highest-ranked non-reasoning AI model from China. The rankings on Chatbot Arena are determined by user votes based on output quality.\n\nHowever, in the overall standings, DeepSeek R1 remains the highest-ranked Chinese AI model, holding the third position. Adding to China's growing presence in the field, another Chinese AI startup, Zhipu AI, also secured a spot in the top ten.\n\nChatbot Arena noted in a post that four of the top ten companies are Chinese, highlighting China's efforts to close the gap with US AI advancements.",

The stock remains up by 2.9% on the day, buoyed by rumors of a potential investment in the Chinese AI company DeepSeek.\n\nIn the recent speculation, Alibaba was believed to be considering a $1 billion investment in DeepSeek, a company that has made notable strides with its R1 and V3 large language models. These models are reported to outperform those of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Alphabet. Concurrently, Alibaba has introduced its own AI product and started hosting DeepSeek on its cloud servers, adding to the buzz around the stock.\n\nHowever, Alibaba has officially denied any investment plans in DeepSeek, with company officials dismissing the reports as \"fake news.\" Despite this, the stock continues to see positive market reaction, indicating investor interest in Alibaba's prospects in the AI space.\n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, Alibaba (BABA, Financial) currently trades at $103.29 with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.1. Despite a slight underperformance in recent years, reflected by a -2.61% change over three years, the stock boasts a substantial 41.98% increase over the past 52 weeks. Its market capitalization stands at $245.42 billion.\n\nEvaluating Alibaba's financial position, the company exhibits a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.84, indicating it is trading below its intrinsic value. The GF Value places Alibaba in the \"Fairly Valued\" category, with a GF Value of approximately $100.46, which can be reviewed further on the GF Value page.\n\nWhile Alibaba faces some financial stress, as indicated by its Altman Z-Score of 2.78 falling in the grey area, it remains unlikely to be engaging in financial manipulation, according to its Beneish M-Score of -2.49. The company\u2019s revenue growth has decelerated, yet its financial strength is bolstered by a solid cash-to-debt ratio of 1.92, indicating sound liquidity.\n\nAlthough Alibaba is a major player in the e-commerce and cloud computing sector, it faces profitability challenges, with its gross and operating margins in a downward trend. Nevertheless, the company's extensive presence in internet retail and emerging interest in AI technology may present new growth avenues. Investors should weigh these prospects against its current valuation and growth metrics, evaluating Alibaba's strategic position within the consumer cyclical sector.",

This surge ignited curiosity about whether the stock can sustain such gains amidst a whirlwind of rumors surrounding the innovative AI firm, DeepSeek.\n\nJust last week, DeepSeek sparked excitement in the market with its R1 and V3 large language models, claiming superiority over offerings from big names like OpenAI and Alphabet. In a swift counterattack, Alibaba showcased its own AI product, boasting that it surpasses DeepSeek in various evaluations. But the plot thickened when reports surfaced that Alibaba planned to invest a staggering $1 billion into DeepSeek, igniting investor enthusiasm.\n\nHowever, the excitement was short-lived. Alibaba quickly nipped the speculation in the bud, asserting through various channels that the investment rumors were unfounded. As Reuters reported, Alibaba\u2019s VP emphatically labeled the news as \u201cfake,\u201d leaving investors puzzled.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway for prospective Alibaba investors? Despite the volatility and cloud of uncertainty, Alibaba\u2019s stock remains appealing at a valuation of 20 times its earnings and 16 times its free cash flow. With projected long-term growth of 18.5% annually, the potential rewards may still outweigh the risks.\n\nIn a world driven by innovation, Alibaba\u2019s next moves could either reinforce its dominance in the tech space or shake investor confidence. Keeping an eye on future developments will be crucial for navigating this dynamic landscape.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Market Moves: The Future of E-Commerce and AI Integration\n\nOverview of Alibaba\u2019s Recent Stock Performance and AI Developments\n\nAlibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, has recently experienced significant fluctuations on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). After an initial spike of over 7%, the stock closed with a notable 4.1% gain, raising questions about its sustainability amid swirling rumors surrounding the AI firm DeepSeek. DeepSeek recently gained attention with its innovative R1 and V3 large language models, claiming they outperform products from industry leaders like OpenAI and Alphabet. In a surprising turn, Alibaba then announced its advancements in AI, purportedly surpassing DeepSeek\u2019s offerings.\n\nHowever, excitement morphed into skepticism when it was rumored that Alibaba intended to invest $1 billion in DeepSeek. The company quickly dismissed these reports, with a VP labeling them as \u201cfake news,\u201d leaving investors uncertain about the future.\n\nRich Snippets and Additional Insights:\n\n1. Market Forecasts: Alibaba\u2019s stock is currently valued at 20 times its earnings and 16 times its free cash flow, suggesting that while there are risks, the potential for growth remains significant, especially with a projected long-term growth rate of 18.5% annually.\n\n2. Pros and Cons:\n\n\u2013 Pros: Leading position in e-commerce, strong AI capabilities, potential for high growth.\n\n\u2013 Cons: Market volatility, potential competition from emerging AI firms, regulatory challenges.\n\n3. Use Cases of AI Innovations: Alibaba\u2019s AI advancements can be applied across various sectors, including e-commerce personalization, customer service automation, and supply chain optimization, positioning it as a competitive player in both tech and retail.\n\n4. Innovations: Alibaba\u2019s focus on AI technology marks a critical pivot in its operational strategy, embracing new technologies to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.\n\n5. Security Aspects: As Alibaba continues to innovate, there will be heightened scrutiny regarding data security and user privacy, particularly in AI applications.\n\n6. Pricing: Investors should pay attention to the pricing strategy of Alibaba\u2019s AI tools, as competitive pricing may solidify its market presence and allure new customers.\n\n7. Sustainability: The pursuit of greener technologies and sustainable practices is becoming increasingly important for major corporations, including Alibaba, to meet global environmental standards.\n\nKey Questions Related to Alibaba and DeepSeek:\n\n1. What should investors consider before investing in Alibaba?\n\n\u2013 Investors should evaluate Alibaba\u2019s growth potential against the backdrop of market volatility and evolving AI competition. A 20 P/E ratio and 16 times cash flow suggest reasonable pricing, but the rapid pace of technological change could impact long-term success.\n\n2. How does Alibaba\u2019s AI technology compare to competitors?\n\n\u2013 While DeepSeek has recently garnered attention, Alibaba\u2019s demonstration of superior AI capabilities indicates that it is still a formidable player. Future comparisons will reveal which firm can deliver the best technology and customer solutions.\n\n3. Will Alibaba\u2019s dismissal of investment rumors affect its stock?\n\n\u2013 Alibaba\u2019s swift denial of the investment rumors aimed to stabilize investor sentiment. However, continuous scrutiny of its public relations and perceived openness will play a significant role in shaping investor confidence moving forward.\n\nFor ongoing updates and further exploration of Alibaba\u2019s market strategies, visit Alibaba.",

The China-based e-commerce and cloud computing giant soared on the same news that drove Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) shares nearly 11% lower last month: the introduction of a new artificial intelligence (AI) system called DeepSeek.\n\nAlibaba embraces a twist on AI tradition\n\nAlibaba is not the company behind DeepSeek. The innovative large language model (LLM) is run by a software company by the same name, privately owned by a Chinese hedge fund named High-Flyer.\n\nThat being said, Alibaba manages an LLM of its own, called Qwen. The company was quick to introduce DeepSeek services on its cloud platform, giving clients the option to train their own DeepSeek-based LLMs with proprietary data feeds. It also released a new version of Qwen, Quen2.5, immediately after DeepSeek made a splash. The upgrade was unexpected because it fell on the first day of Lunar New Year -- an important holiday on the Chinese calendar.\n\nSo Alibaba is doing more than simply riding the coattails of a new challenger in the LLM industry. The company is actively employing and reselling DeepSeek technology on its own platform, while also fighting back with a better version of its in-house AI solutions.\n\nAlibaba stays nimble in the high-tech arena\n\nNone of this is game-changing for Alibaba. However, it's good to see the Chinese giant staying light on its proverbial feet, ready to respond to new challenges at the drop of a hat. That's how you keep your business viable in the long run.\n\nThat's good news for longtime Alibaba holders like yours truly. I expect to find out more about the company's DeepSeek response and general AI strategy in next week's fourth-quarter earnings report. If nothing else, analysts should poke and prod Alibaba's management for these important details on the earnings call.\n\nUntil then, Alibaba remains a low-priced, fast-growing giant in several promising fields of business. The stock has struggled in recent years, arguably setting new investors up for great long-term returns.\n\nToday, it trades at the modest valuation of 20.6 times earnings and 15.8 times free cash flows. These ratios are very affordable next to AI-based market darlings like Nvidia or cloud-plus-retail giants such as Amazon and MercadoLibre.\n\nWhatever comes next for Alibaba, one thing is for sure: Its fortunes should rise or fall depending on how effective the AI strategy turns out to be.",

Even better, annual earnings are slotted to climb 79% to $5.20 per share from EPS of $2.90 in 2023.\n\nTracking Amazon\u2019s Valuation\n\nTrading around $240, AMZN is at a 38X forward earnings multiple which isn't an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500 and is near Microsoft\u2019s 31.5X.\n\nAlso encouraging to long-term investors is that AMZN trades well below its five-year high of 161.3X forward earnings and offers a steep discount to the median of 66X during this period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAhead of its Q4 report, Amazon stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). To that point, the Zacks ESP does suggest Amazon could report strong Q4 results on the heels of its record holiday shopping season.\n\nPlus, the rally in AMZN may certainly continue if this is accompanied by favorable guidance with Zacks projections calling for another year of double-digit top and bottom line growth in FY25.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The halt followed US President Donald Trump 's decision to do away with the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption for low-value packages.Under the exemption, shipments worth less than $800 were allowed to enter the country duty-free.

The halt also came just days after the Trump administration introduced an additional sweeping levy of 10 per cent on goods imported from China.Beijing, seeking to retaliate against the new US tariffs, announced a range of economic measures of its own.Starting February 10, China is set to tax certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas from the US at 15 per cent. Among others, a 10% tariff on crude oil and certain types of vehicles will also be levied by the Chinese.Trump had also announced a levy of 25 per cent on imports from Mexico and Canada. The move was, however, suspended for 30 days following high-level discussions.Trump has also hinted at introducing such instruments of protectionism against the European Union (EU). \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products,\" the US President was quoted as saying by the BBC on Monday.The \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption allowed for the duty-free entry of low-value packages to the US.

            "content": "Shares of Chinese e-commerce stocks Alibaba (BABA 5.72%), Tencent (TCEHY 2.32%), and PDD Holdings (PDD 5.57%) were rallying on Tuesday, up 4.7%, 4.1%, and 8.8%, respectively, as of 1 p.m. ET.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive that Chinese stocks would be rising, given that China just announced countermeasures today as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump putting a new 10% tariff on goods imported from China.\n\nHowever, given the negotiated delays on tariffs for imports from other countries and what might be perceived as a mild response by China, the new \"tariff war\" may be less severe than investors had anticipated.\n\nTariff tit for tat to start Trump's tenure\n\nOver the weekend, Trump announced 10% tariffs on most goods imported from China, along with 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada. But the positive move in Chinese stocks today may be due to Monday's delays in tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. Those tariffs were postponed for a month yesterday, after Trump struck deals with both countries regarding border security.\n\nBut China announced countermeasures today, placing a 15% tariff on a subset of goods including U.S.-imported oil, agricultural machinery, and certain automobile brands, and a 10% tariff on U.S. coal and natural gas. These are set to go into effect on Feb. 10, which gives China and the U.S. some time for negotiations before they go into effect.\n\nAdditionally, China launched an antitrust probe into Alphabet, and put PVH Corporation, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, as well as gene-mapping biotech Illumina on China's \"entity list,\" accusing these two very different companies of violating fair trade practices in China.\n\nClearly, an escalating trade war with the U.S. wouldn't be good for the Chinese economy, and therefore these leading Chinese e-commerce stocks. Alibaba is an e-commerce, cloud computing, and fintech giant in China. Tencent is the owner of WeChat, the country's largest social media platform, the country's largest video game publisher, and a leading fintech player as well. Given their size, both companies are sensitive to China's overall economic outlook.\n\nMeanwhile, e-commerce disruptor and Alibaba rival PDD Holdings would not only see headwinds from a continued soft Chinese economy, but it's also the parent company of international e-commerce platform Temu, which has become quite popular in the U.S. Temu might be at greater risk than the others, as it could see its U.S. growth slow or even stop if the U.S. clamps down on small-dollar imports. Currently, shipments of $800 or less can avoid paying import taxes to the U.S., and Temu's bargain-priced goods therefore avoid that threshold. However, it's possible trade tensions will spur a move to close that loophole and thereby increase Temu's cost of doing business in the U.S..\n\nGiven all this, why would Chinese stocks be rallying, with PDD Holdings up the most? This is likely because investors consider today's countermeasures to be relatively mild, or better-than-feared. The new Chinese countermeasures only target about $20 billion of U.S.-imported goods, and left off some key strategic items. That's far below the $450 billion worth of Chinese goods included under Trump's broad 10% tariff.\n\nThus, investors may see these countermeasures as mere warnings, and the week-long window to implementation as time for a negotiated settlement. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping would talk in the next few days.\n\nBut China may be different than Canada and Mexico\n\nWhile investors were encouraged by the relative restraint on China's side and with Trump's deals with Mexico and Canada, investors in China-sensitive stocks shouldn't get too complacent. After all, Mexico and Canada are allies on U.S. borders, while China is considered a geopolitical rival and potential threat.\n\nChinese and China-exposed stocks are by no means out of the woods, and things could turn down again if a deal isn't reached within a week.\n\nWhile leading Chinese tech and e-commerce stocks are cheaper than their U.S. rivals, they aren't quite as cheap as they were six months ago following a rally after the announcements of new Chinese stimulus measures. Meanwhile, these three big companies still face risks if China becomes increasingly isolated due to an escalation of this conflict.",

The company offers a variety of services, including consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales through both Chinese and international platforms. It also provides services like digital media, entertainment, logistics, and cloud computing. Alibaba owns many businesses in different industries around the world.\n\nOn September 19, 2014, Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and raised $25 billion in its initial public offering (IPO), making it the largest IPO ever at that time with a market value of $231 billion. Today, it is one of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world and ranked 31st on Forbes\u2019 2020 Global 2000 list.

It also broke records on China\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day, the biggest shopping event in the world, both online and offline.\n\nThe name \u201cAlibaba\u201d was chosen by the company\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, because it is based on the well-known character Ali Baba from the Middle Eastern story collection One Thousand and One Nights. Jack Ma felt the name was easy to remember, globally recognized, and had a positive meaning. In the story, Ali Baba is a kind character who helps others, which Ma saw as a perfect fit for the company\u2019s mission of helping small businesses succeed. The name was confirmed when a waitress recognized \u201cAli Baba\u201d from the famous phrase \u201cOpen Sesame.\u201d\n\nGeneral Alibaba Statistics\n\nAlibaba plans to reach $1.4 trillion in total sales (GMV) by 2024.

Alibaba\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and investments show that the company is still in a strong financial position.

In its simplest sense, a tariff is a tax on foreign products that raises their prices and is paid by the consumers of the importing country.\n\nTrump Levies Tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China\n\nPresident Donald Trump is wasting no time in implementing his tariff promises to his voters. Over the weekend, Trump announced that the US would levy a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tax on imports from China (effective Tuesday). In response, Canada has announced retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion in goods imported from the United States, further escalating the trade war.\n\nWhat Is Trump\u2019s Plan with Tariffs?\n\nUndoubtedly, the US has the most robust economy out of the nations involved in the trade dispute. That said, as US equity futures imply, tariffs can have a dampening impact on the country levying them in the short term. Which begs the question, \u201cWhat are Trump\u2019s tariff plans?\u201d\n\nLuckily, Trump has a long enough history in and out of public office to surmise what he may be up to. Trump even wrote a book titled, \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d back in 1987, which laid out negotiating principles such as:\n\n\u00b7 Leverage: Utilize what the other party needs to your advantage.\n\n\u00b7 Be Willing to Walk Away: Trump believes that walking away from a bad deal can ultimately lead to a better deal in time.\n\n\u00b7 Control the Narrative: Love him or hate him, Trump has an undeniable way of getting his message out through social media and combative press interactions.\n\nIn all likelihood, Trump and his team are using tariffs as a negotiating tool (not to earn more taxes) to attain more optimal trade deals (knowing that other countries rely on the US more economically than the US relies on them).\n\nHow Should Traders Handle Tariffs?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s unconventional tariff plan will work, but in the meantime, investors must focus on handling the market as it lies. Currently, investors face an uncertain, news-driven market with the threat of \u201ctape bombs\u201d (or unexpected market drops). Below are five ways to handle the current market:\n\n1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe United States\u2019 lead in artificial intelligence technology has become questionable after the release of DeepSeek\u2019s AI models. As a direct consequence, the US Commerce Department is now looking into whether the Chinese company used US chips that were not allowed to be shipped to China in the first place. Last week, DeepSeek\u2019s AI model and its free assistant, which the company claimed used less data and power than US models, wreaked havoc in the tech world and resulted in a massive broad market sell-off.\n\nREAD NOW: 12 Must-See AI News and Ratings You Might Have Missed and 10 AI Stocks on Analysts\u2019 Radar Right Now\n\nInvestors began questioning the sustainability of the huge investments in AI made by leading tech giants and the significant power demand from power-hungry data centers. DeepSeek\u2019s emergence led to worries that cost-effective AI solutions would erode market share and US tech companies\u2019 profitability. Consequently, a rout sparked that wiped around $1 trillion off U.S. technology stocks.\n\nDeepSeek has claimed that its chatbot performs on par or better than Microsoft-backed OpenAI at a fraction of the cost. However, a report published by NewsGuard has revealed that the chatbot achieved only 17% accuracy in delivering news and information. It further revealed that it repeated false claims 30% of the time and gave vague or useless answers 53% of the time in response to news-related prompts, raising doubts about the claims it initially made.\n\nWhile clarity on these models is yet to be achieved, the current restrictions on companies such as Nvidia have been in place to stop the most sophisticated chips from reaching China and restrict the country from taking the lead in AI. According to a source reported by Reuters, however, organized AI chip smuggling to China has been tracked out of a few countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn this regard, Singapore\u2019s trade ministry noted that there is no reason to believe that DeepSeek obtained any export-controlled products from the country. It further noted that it has always upheld the rule of law and acted decisively against those who disobey the rules.\n\n\u201cWe expect U.S. companies to comply with U.S. export controls and our domestic legislation. Our customs and law enforcement agencies will continue to work closely with their U.S. counterparts.\u201d \u2013 Singapore\u2019s Trade Ministry\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 115\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. On February 3rd, the South China Morning Post reported that Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s cloud-computing services unit has now made DeepSeek\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) models available on its platform. This move follows similar ones made by other Big Tech companies to bring the Chinese start-up\u2019s open-source systems to their clients.\n\n\u201cOn [our] platform, users can achieve the whole process from training to deployment to inference with zero coding\u201d. -Alibaba Cloud said in a statement posted on WeChat.\n\nAccording to Alibaba, the platform enables users to train, deploy, and use AI without coding. Users can log into its PAI Model Gallery to access DeepSeek\u2019s models, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, and deploy them to \u201cpower their own reasoning and text-generating applications\u201d. The platform also provides so-called distilled versions of those models, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\n\nOverall BABA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The latest global large model ranking has been released, and Alibaba's new model surpasses DeepSeek V3.\n\nOn February 4th local time, the globally renowned AI model evaluation platform Chatbot Arena announced the latest ranking. Among them, Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen team's latest large language model Qwen2.5-Max achieved excellent results, ranking 7th overall, ahead of top proprietary large language models such as DeepSeek V3, O1-Mini, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.\n\nLooking at the scoring items, Qwen2.5-Max performed particularly well in the technical field, ranking first in mathematics and programming, and second in handling complex tasks with hard prompts.\n\nIn the past year, Alibaba has continuously expanded the Qwen model family, launching various models covering text, audio, and visual formats to meet the growing AI demands of global developers and customers.\n\nIn the early hours of January 29th, Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen team quietly launched Qwen2.5-Max.

Industry media \"Information Equality\" stated, if Alibaba's Qwen-2.5-Max indeed outperforms V3 this time, greater expectations can be placed on its RL reasoning model.\n\nAfter the release of Qwen2.5-Max, it quickly attracted significant attention from users and developers both domestically and internationally Some netizens vividly summarized that Qwen2.5-Max is equivalent to the \"Chinese version of ChatGPT,\" but its level is \"much higher\" than the latter.\n\nSome users stated that Qwen2.5-Max has \"redefined\" the video generation function, already surpassing OpenAI's Sora.\n\nSome users even believe that Qwen2.5-Max has severely \"slapped\" ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the beach.\n\nOther netizens created meme images, speculating that after DeepSeek-R1, this powerful AI model from China will further intensify OpenAI's concerns.",

The announcement comes as AI development in China gains momentum, with new players entering the space and established firms adjusting their strategies.\n\nIn recent weeks, DeepSeek has gained traction with a different approach to AI. Its V3 model, introduced late last year, was reportedly trained on a budget of just USD 5.6 million, a fraction of what larger firms typically spend. Then, just before the Lunar New Year, DeepSeek followed up with R1, a model said to be on par with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-o1.\n\nUnlike models that depend on large-scale computing infrastructure, DeepSeek has prioritized efficiency and lower costs. This approach has attracted interest from businesses seeking a balance between AI performance and cost-effectiveness. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2014an OpenAI backer\u2014have also added R1 to their model catalogs, further raising its visibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba is taking a different route. With Qwen 2.5-Max, the company is focusing on both AI performance and cloud infrastructure. The model is part of a broader rollout that includes a series of upgraded cloud computing services aimed at enhancing efficiency for AI applications.\n\nTo drive adoption, Alibaba Cloud is also launching a generative AI \u201cempowerment program,\u201d offering free cloud credits, training, and co-marketing opportunities for developers and businesses using Qwen models. In its statement, Alibaba said the goal is to support AI adoption across industries while equipping enterprises with the tools to scale their applications.\n\nFor Beijing, these developments are likely encouraging. The releases of Qwen 2.5-Max and DeepSeek\u2019s latest models signal China\u2019s growing role in the global AI sector. Once viewed as trailing industry leaders like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, China\u2019s AI firms are now demonstrating their ability to compete on equal footing\u2014and, in some cases, exceed expectations set by global counterparts.",

            "content": "Too many investors are overlooking this company's budding turnaround.\n\nIs your portfolio chock-full of the same names everyone else seems to own? Perhaps you're looking for a winning stock that has flown under the radar.\n\nSuch stocks are few and far between in this record-setting market, but they're out there. Take China's e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 5.72%) as an example. The company has fallen out of favor following the stock's 70% decline from its all-time high, but it's actually a compelling pick for investors.\n\nHere's why you should buy Alibaba stock\n\nAlibaba's Tmall and Taobao platforms collectively control about half of China's e-commerce market (plus a significant share in a handful of neighboring countries). The other half is mostly split between Temu parent PDD Holdings and JD.com.\n\nThe roughly $60 billion of annual revenue from its online marketplaces make up less than half of the company's overall top line, however. The remaining segments include of a logistics operation called Cainiao, a cloud computing arm, and international e-commerce, among others.\n\nLike many companies, Alibaba saw its business surge early in the pandemic only to experience a growth hangover as the crisis waned. However, it's on the upswing again with third-quarter revenue up 5% year over year and net income rising nearly 60%. This progress extends top-line momentum the company has enjoyed since early last year.\n\nWhile Alibaba seems to finally be out of its pandemic-induced funk, the reasons to consider stepping into an Alibaba stake right now are far more specific. Four of them stand out from the rest.\n\n1. Consumer spending in China is growing\n\nAs well as Alibaba may be managing and promoting its e-commerce business, its success is still ultimately tethered to the state of China's economy, and China's consumer spending in particular. That's why 2023 was such a tough year -- the pandemic's impact lingered far longer than anticipated.\n\nMatters are considerably more encouraging now. The country's retail sales have grown every month (on a year-over-year basis) for two consecutive years, buoyed by last year's reported GDP growth of 5.0%. Though market research outfit eMarketer predicts China's retail spending will only grow 3.5% this year, e-commerce spending could increase double digits, according to multiple reports.\n\n2. The state of the company is no longer in question\n\n\n\nInvestors keeping tabs on Alibaba for the past couple of years will remember management has struggled to develop a cohesive vision for the company. In late 2023, for example, it cancelled well-lauded plans to spin off its cloud computing arm. And early last year, it reversed its plans to shed its Cainiao logistics business. Even if these were ultimately the right decisions, investors didn't like the uncertainty around the future of these core operations.\n\nNow, roughly one year removed from these reversals and with concrete plans for all of its businesses (following a management shakeup), it's easier to be bullish on the company's outlook.\n\n3. It boasts a healthy balance sheet\n\nIt's not said often enough, but debt can quietly chip away at a company's market position. It limits deployable capital that might be needed to ride out tough times or when growth opportunities arise.\n\nThat's not Alibaba though. While it does have some debt, the $235 billion company is only nursing around $28.8 billion in borrowings, and it has nearly twice that amount in cash and liquid assets. Furthermore, it's generated $14.5 billion worth of free cash flow in the past year.\n\nAll of this is why Fitch Ratings rates what little debt Alibaba is carrying at a rock-solid A+. The company can handle any conceivable cash challenge or invest in growth without threatening its financial stability.\n\n4. Alibaba is an AI up-and-comer as well\n\nFinally, Alibaba has also entered the artificial intelligence fray -- one of the reasons it opted to hold onto its cloud computing business rather than shedding it back in 2023.\n\nJust a few days after Chinese start-up DeepSeek roiled the market with its low-cost, high-efficiency AI model, Alibaba unveiled its own model, Qwen 2.5-Max, which it claims is even better than DeepSeek's.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how competitive Alibaba will be in the AI race, the long-term opportunity is significant. Precedence Research suggests the industry is set to grow at an annualized pace of 19% through 2034. It's not unreasonable to believe Alibaba's AI efforts could become the next major growth engine for the company.\n\nJust keep it in perspective -- and on a short leash\n\nThough Alibaba appears to be on the upswing, it still faces tough challenges like increasing e-commerce competition and macroeconomic struggles in China.\n\nWith shares trading at just 11 times expected 2025 earnings (and still down 70% from their all-time high), I don't believe investors are pricing in nearly enough of Alibaba's potential upside. This is a rare bargain in today's market.\n\nJust keep in mind this is apt to remain a volatile ticker in the near term.",

Tech, consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy were all off more than 2%.\n\nThe brisk retreat in the benchmark index over the past two sessions has the hallmarks of a momentum unwind catalyzed by Walmart\u2019s lackluster outlook: the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF fell nearly twice as much as the S&P 500 in the final couple trading days of the week. Walmart, for its part, extended yesterday\u2019s losses to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time since August.\n\nFlows related to this month\u2019s options expiry may have played a role in the magnitude of the downdraft.\n\nNvidia, for instance, had a significant amount of open interest in calls expiring on Friday with a strike price of $140.

            "content": "In a bold move following DeepSeek\u2019s viral success, Chinese tech giant Alibaba has introduced its latest AI model, Qwen 2.5-Max, with the goal to make waves in the rapidly evolving AI space.\n\nLaunched on the first day of the Lunar New Year, Alibaba asserts that its enhanced model surpasses competitors like ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s Llama, and DeepSeek in a majority of performance benchmarks.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s release of the upgraded Qwen 2.5-Max follows the debut of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model, which has garnered attention for offering similar performance to top AI models at a significantly lower development cost.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s innovation has had a significant effect, and contributed to a major dip in the market value of leading tech firms. Notably, Nvidia saw a record loss of nearly $600 billion, marking the largest single-day decline in U.S. stock market history.\n\nIn its testing, Alibaba says that its upgraded model achieved an impressive 89.4 on the Arena-Hard benchmark, which evaluates how effectively AI systems respond to human prompts.\n\nAdditionally, in testing on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, which measures an AI model\u2019s ability to solve problems at a college level, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5-Max outperformed DeepSeek and showed comparable performance to ChatGPT, according to the company\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cThis endeavor holds the promise of enabling our models to transcend human intelligence, unlocking the potential to explore uncharted territories of knowledge and understanding,\u201d developers stated on GitHub.\n\nMuch like DeepSeek\u2019s approach, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 utilizes a \u201cmix of experts\u201d architecture, designed not just to compete with but to exceed the capabilities of DeepSeek\u2019s models.\n\nThis architecture enables the system to selectively activate specific parameter sets, boosting efficiency and allowing it to manage more complex tasks without significantly increasing resource demand.\n\nOpenAI \u201cBites Back\u201d\n\nJust days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised improved models in the future, the company unveiled its newest addition to the reasoning series, the o3-mini. This new model is designed to be more cost-effective and is accessible through both ChatGPT and the API.\n\nFirst previewed in December 2024, OpenAI\u2019s latest model boasts impressive STEM performance, excelling in science, math, and coding, while maintaining the affordability and low latency of the o1-mini.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s latest release offers streaming support and three customizable reasoning effort settings. Developers can adjust the model to prioritize either deep analysis or fast performance, depending on the task at hand, optimizing for either complexity or speed as needed.\n\nThe new model has received praise for its strong performance in deep research, automation, coding, and decision-making. However, some users reportedly feel that it lags behind in user interface design and speed, especially when compared to competitors like Claude or o1-pro.\n\nAlthough it surpasses DeepSeek R1 in certain benchmarks, particularly complex logic tasks, it does not consistently outperform other models across all areas. The launch has ignited both excitement and discussions within the AI community, raising questions about its potential impact on the future of AI development and use.\n\nRead More\n\nMichaela has no crypto positions and does not hold any crypto assets.

Last week, the company's cloud computing and AI arm, Alibaba Cloud, released an upgraded version of its Qwen model, the Qwen 2.5-Max, which it claimed to have \"comprehensively outperformed\" the V3 model launched in December by Chinese start-up DeepSeek that has drawn comparison to advanced products from OpenAI.\n\nAlibaba Cloud said its Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms DeepSeek's V3 model.

Photo: AP Photo>\n\nDeepSeek has drawn worldwide attention for its new open-source reasoning model, R1, which the company said had achieved capabilities comparable to OpenAI's closed-source GPT models in some areas at a fraction of the usual cost.\n\nLast month, DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng took part in a meeting hosted by Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing.\n\nAlibaba Cloud said the benchmark performance of Qwen 2.5-Max was also on a par with US firm Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model.\n\nThe company has been expanding overseas amid a slowing Chinese economy, despite facing what Alibaba Group co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai described as \"the most challenging geopolitical environment in decades\".\n\nIn 2022, the US government reviewed Alibaba's cloud business to assess potential national security risks. The company is also one of several Chinese tech firms affected by US export controls on advanced semiconductors.\n\nAt its annual developer summit in Indonesia in January, Alibaba Cloud said its latest models under the Qwen family had been made accessible to global developers via application programming interfaces on its generative AI development platform, Model Studio.\n\nStory Continues",

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Alibaba Health Information Technology ( ). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nAlibaba Health Information Technology's Improving Profits\n\nAlibaba Health Information Technology has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Alibaba Health Information Technology's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from CN\u00a50.061 to CN\u00a50.075. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 24% gain.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Despite the relatively flat revenue figures, shareholders will be pleased to see EBIT margins have grown from 0.9% to 4.1% in the last 12 months. That's something to smile about.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to .\n\nAre Alibaba Health Information Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Alibaba Health Information Technology has a market capitalisation of HK$58b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at CN\u00a511b. This totals to 19% of shares in the company. Enough to lead management's decision making process down a path that brings the most benefit to shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.\n\nShould You Add Alibaba Health Information Technology To Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Alibaba Health Information Technology is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

            "content": "Alibaba Unveils Qwen 2.5 AI Model, Claims Superiority Over DeepSeek The launch on Lunar New Year marks Alibaba's response to the rapid rise of DeepSeek's innovative AI technology.\n\nAlibaba has officially launched its Qwen 2.5 AI model, declaring it superior to its competitors, particularly DeepSeek\u2019s notable DeepSeek-V3. The release, occurring on January 29, coincided with the Lunar New Year, highlighting the pressure exerted by DeepSeek's recent success.\n\nFollowing the release of DeepSeek-R1 just days earlier on January 20, Alibaba is not just entering the market; it's making bold claims about Qwen 2.5. According to the cloud division of Alibaba, \"Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,\" as reported through the company's official WeChat account. This statement marks the beginning of what many see as an intense competition within China\u2019s burgeoning AI sector.\n\nDeepSeek made waves with its R1 model, performing closely to offerings from established giants like OpenAI. Emerging from the creativity of young tech talent and university students, DeepSeek also surprised the market by boasting significantly lower operational costs, prompting questions about the sustainability of larger firms\u2019 spending.\n\nThe competition is heated. Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 leverages cutting-edge training methodologies, including Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The incorporation of its innovative Mixture of Experts architecture allows for efficient resource utilization, enabling the model to outperform rivals during performance testing across multiple key benchmarks.\n\nAlibaba's timing of the Qwen 2.5 launch was strategic, indicating its urgency to regain competitive footing against DeepSeek. During the launch announcement, the company illustrated superior performance figures for Qwen 2.5 against various benchmarks. \"It is priced at $0.38 per million input tokens, making it accessible for small businesses and startups,\" sources indicate. This highlights Alibaba's intent to capture market segments moving away from their pricier American counterparts.\n\nDespite these advancements, both models deal with challenges stemming from China\u2019s censorial environment. Both Qwen and DeepSeek avoid politically sensitive topics, potentially hindering broader global adoption. What\u2019s more, their contrasting operational philosophies may influence their long-term success: DeepSeek operates with fewer financial resources but with agility and innovation, whereas Alibaba presents itself as part of the more substantial tech conglomerate dynamic.\n\nLiang Wenfeng, the founder of DeepSeek, expressed confidence in their direction, noting, \"We did not care about price wars... achieving AGI was our main goal.\" This ambition positions DeepSeek as not only competitors but as pioneers within China's AI evolution. Their approach reflects their intent to challenge established norms and reshape the future of AI.\n\nMarket analysts have reinforced the notion of this competition spurring innovation among tech giants around the world. Industry expert \u00c2ngelo Vieira Jr. commented, \"The competition... boosts national rivalries and does not indicate any advantages for the United States.\" This perspective is particularly relevant as it points to the pressures faced by firms like OpenAI and Google to refine their strategies and respond effectively to the rapid advancements from Chinese companies.\n\nOverall, as Qwen 2.5 joins DeepSeek on the stage, many observers are eager to see how this rivalry shapes the global AI narrative. With the scaling of AI capabilities and the entrance of fresh competitors, it appears inevitable for existing paradigms to shift. The world will undoubtedly watch as these technological pursuits evolve and potentially transform not just the regional, but the international technological landscapes.\n\nThe future of AI technology remains uncertain but promising, with players like Alibaba and DeepSeek pushing boundaries and exploring new territories.",

            "content": "Alibaba Launches Qwen AI Models, Outpacing Rivals The tech giant's Qwen 2.5-Max offers competitive benchmarks against DeepSeek and OpenAI\n\nChinese tech and e-commerce giant Alibaba has unveiled its latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) with the release of Qwen 2.5-Max and Qwen 2.5-VL, positioning itself as a significant player alongside established competitors. On Wednesday, the company claimed its new AI model, Qwen 2.5-Max, has outperformed several leading systems across key benchmarks, including DeepSeek V3, demonstrating its capabilities in code generation and general tasks.\n\nThe launch of Qwen 2.5-Max follows the startling emergence of models from DeepSeek, which have captured the attention of Silicon Valley, challenging the entrenched belief of U.S. dominance within the competitive AI arena. With companies across the globe pouring billions of dollars sought to advance their own AI technologies, the appearance of formidable Chinese models is raising industry eyebrows.\n\nAccording to Alibaba's Qwen team, the new model was trained using over 20 trillion tokens of data and exhibits competitive performance compared to renowned systems like OpenAI's GPT-4, as well as Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The confidence behind Qwen 2.5-Max is reflected as it is now available to developers through Alibaba Cloud services, accessed primarily via Qwen Chat, the firm's conversational AI platform.\n\nImportantly, Qwen 2.5-Max is compatible with OpenAI's API format, which facilitates its adoption for organizations already utilizing similar AI services. This integration is expected to smooth the transition for developers and businesses integrating the model within their existing operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba did not compare Qwen 2.5-Max directly with DeepSeek's recently launched R1 model. The R1 is noted for its focus on reasoning, generating considerable buzz since its introduction as a chatbot on January 20. Both developments within Alibaba and DeepSeek demonstrate the rapid pace of evolution within the Chinese AI sector.\n\nAlongside the Qwen 2.5-Max model, Alibaba launched Qwen 2.5-VL, which is positioned as an open-source multimodal model building on its predecessor capabilities. This model is reported to excel at processing various forms of data and content types, including texts, charts, diagrams, and longer video analyses. Notably, Qwen 2.5-VL is equipped to convert unstructured data from documents like invoices and forms to organized formats such as JSON, highlighting its potential for automative functionalities.\n\nThe versatility of Qwen 2.5-VL signifies its role as more than just a traditional AI, as it combines handy features for tasks ranging from visual question answering to college-level math problems, thereby strengthening Alibaba's push to integrate AI across its platform ecosystem.\n\nBuilding upon these capabilities, Qwen 2.5-VL-72B-Instruct remarkably performs well across numerous benchmarks, supporting various applications from document reading to visual tasks. Alibaba emphasizes the competitive edge of its flagship model over peers, asserting, \u201cQwen 2.5-Max outperforms \u2026 almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1-405B,\u201d as stated by Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit via WeChat.\n\nBoth Qwen 2.5-Max and Qwen 2.5-VL models are currently accessible on Alibaba's Qwen Chat platform. This move signifies Alibaba\u2019s dedication to enhancing user interaction and exploration with these AI systems, thereby paving the way for developers to engage and utilize these powerful tools competently.\n\nThe launch of the Qwen 2.5 models is occurring against the backdrop of the AI arms race prompted by the competition. Recently, DeepSeek initiated significant discussions with the release of its AI assistant driven by the DeepSeek-V3 model on January 10, continuing to heighten expectations for tech firms to update and refine their AI offerings.\n\nIndustry analysts are watching Alibaba's ascent closely, viewing these advancements as pivotal for its cloud computing segment and overall market standing. Improved investor sentiment is apparent following the 2020 selloff, with Alibaba\u2019s stock on the rise as options market activity suggests this trend is likely to persist.\n\nNonetheless, the competitive atmosphere is fierce, with Alibaba faced with pressures from domestic rivals such as Pinduoduo and JD.com, as well as emergent AI enterprises like SenseTime and Baidu, which are also working relentlessly to innovate and capture market share.\n\nFor Alibaba, engaging successfully within this ever-challenging AI field signifies both opportunities and concerns as it navigates the complex dynamics of technological advancement and marketplace influence.\n\nThis newly released round of AI models reflects not just technological progress, but also the shifting axis of power and capabilities within the global AI marketplace, as Alibaba and its competitors leverage innovation and performance to stake their claims.",

The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC's retail businesses and strength in AliExpress' Choice are contributing well.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth.\n\n\n\nStrength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba's international business. However, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nAirbnb's shares have underperformed the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry over the past year (-8% vs. +28.5%). The company is facing greater volatility in travel demands due to macroeconomic uncertainties, rising competition and impacts of geopolitical conflicts remain concerns.\n\n\n\nNevertheless. Airbnb is benefiting from continuous improvements in Nights and Experiences Booked, enabling it to witness a positive trend in its Gross Booking Value. Growing gross nights booked, owing to solid momentum across high-density urban areas and first-time bookers, is a tailwind.\n\n\n\nIncreasing guest demand and continuous recovery in cross-border travel are major positives. Strong momentum in active listings, owing to supply growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, is benefiting the top line. Moreover, growing awareness around hosting and new features introduced for hosts is a plus.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Royal Caribbean Cruises have outperformed the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry over the past six months (+72.5% vs. +26.8%). The company reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the revenues missed. Notably, both top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\n\n\n\nIt is benefiting from strong cruising demand from new and loyal guests and robust booking trends. Also, strength in consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases bodes well. The company emphasized investing in a modern digital travel platform to streamline the vacation booking process for its customers and expand wallet share.\n\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, management estimates EPS to be in the band of $2.43-$2.53. However, increased costs and expenses, foreign currency risks and global macro headwinds are concerning for the company's prospects.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Royal Caribbean Cruises here >>>)\n\n\n\nDallasNews' shares have outperformed the Zacks Publishing - Newspapers industry over the past year (+68.4% vs. +13.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $37.74 million is transitioning to a modern, cost-efficient printing facility in Carrollton, aiming to cut expenses and enhance profitability by Q1 2025. The sale of its Plano property is expected to generate proceeds for reinvestment.\n\n\n\nDigital subscription growth has gained momentum, with over 3,100 new subscribers in Q3 and 2,500 in early Q4 2024, supported by a revised pricing model. Medium Giant, its marketing division, reported a $400,000 Y/Y revenue increase in Q3, bolstering diversification efforts. Investments in digital innovation, including a video platform and enhanced user engagement tools, further align with its digital transformation strategy.\n\n\n\nHowever, print revenue continues to decline, with an 8.8% Y/Y drop in subscribers.

Unlike some of its rivals, Alibaba is taking a hybrid approach, blending open-source transparency with proprietary advancements.\n\nAccording to data released by Alibaba, Qwen2.5-Max has been rigorously tested across five major AI benchmarks:\n\nArena-Hard \u2013 Evaluates AI\u2019s ability to align with human preferences , a crucial factor for AI assistant-like usability.\n\n\u2013 Evaluates AI\u2019s ability to align with , a crucial factor for AI assistant-like usability.

MMLU-Pro \u2013 An advanced AI benchmark that tests AI\u2019s college-level understanding across multiple disciplines.\n\nAlibaba claims that Qwen2.5-Max is on par with Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and dominates GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1-405B in most of these categories. However, it falls slightly behind Claude-3.5-Sonnet in LiveCodeBench and trails in GPQA-Diamond, a benchmark that tests deep knowledge of scientific disciplines.\n\nThis means that while Qwen2.5-Max isn\u2019t an undisputed champion, it is one of the strongest challengers OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta have ever faced.\n\nThe Deepseek Shockwave: How China\u2019s AI Industry Set Wall Street on Fire\n\nThe unveiling of DeepSeek-V3 earlier this week was already a massive disruptor. DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot quickly became the #1 most downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store, beating ChatGPT in popularity. This unexpected explosion in interest sent a wave of panic through global financial markets.\n\nThe result? A historic $1 trillion loss across major U.S. tech stocks in just a few days.\n\nBiggest victims of the DeepSeek Effect:\n\nNvidia suffered the worst single-day market loss in U.S. history, dropping 60% in value .\n\nsuffered the in U.S. history, dropping . Microsoft , Meta , and Google saw hundreds of billions wiped off their stock prices as investors reeled from the sudden AI power shift.\n\n, , and saw hundreds of billions as investors reeled from the sudden AI power shift. OpenAI and Anthropic, the U.S.\u2019s top AI contenders, are now racing to respond to China\u2019s unexpected advancements.\n\nWhy DeepSeek matters\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s R1 model made headlines not just for its competitive performance, but for its affordability and efficiency. Some experts believe it outperforms OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 in key areas while being significantly cheaper to operate.\n\nThe tech world did not see this coming, and the result was panic on Wall Street as investors rushed to reassess the AI landscape.\n\nChina\u2019s AI Blitz: Alibaba, Bytedance, and Deepseek Push Back\n\nThe AI showdown is far from over. Following DeepSeek\u2019s record-breaking debut, China\u2019s other AI titans immediately sprang into action:\n\nByteDance (TikTok\u2019s parent company) rushed to update its AI model, Doubao , in response to DeepSeek\u2019s sudden rise.\n\n(TikTok\u2019s parent company) , in response to DeepSeek\u2019s sudden rise. Alibaba, likely feeling the pressure, unveiled Qwen2.5-Max ahead of schedule to keep up with the escalating competition.\n\nThe takeaway? The AI war is accelerating faster than anyone anticipated.\n\nThe AI Battleground: Who Leads Now?\n\nWhile Qwen2.5-Max is an impressive contender, it still faces fierce competition from multiple fronts. Here\u2019s a breakdown of where things stand:\n\nAI Model Top Strengths Weaknesses Qwen2.5-Max (Alibaba) Excels in Arena-Hard and LiveBench, strong in general intelligence and alignment Slightly weaker in LiveCodeBench, trails in GPQA-Diamond (science knowledge) DeepSeek-V3 Extremely cost-effective, performs well in general AI tasks Yet to prove superiority in specialized tasks Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic) Strongest in LiveCodeBench, excellent at human-aligned responses Less aggressive in AI arms race, limited access GPT-4o (OpenAI) Massive global user base, proven leader in multi-modal AI Being challenged by newer, faster, and cheaper models Llama-3.1-405B (Meta) Strong performance across benchmarks Lacks major breakthroughs against competition\n\nThe real question now is: how will OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google respond?",

            "content": "Analysis The speed and efficiency at which DeepSeek claims to be training large language models (LLMs) competitive with America's best has been a reality check for Silicon Valley. However, the startup isn't the only Chinese model builder the US has to worry about.\n\nThis week Chinese cloud and e-commerce goliath Alibaba unveiled a flurry of LLMs including what appears to be a new frontier model called Qwen 2.5 Max that it reckons not only outperforms DeepSeek's V3, which the reasoning-capable R1 is based on, but trounces America's top models.\n\nAs always, we recommend taking benchmarks with a grain of salt, but if Alibaba is to be believed, Qwen 2.5 Max \u2013 which can search the web, and output text, video, and images from inputs \u2013 managed to out perform OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Meta's Llama 3.1 405B across the popular Arena-Hard, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and LiveBench benchmark suites.\n\nHere's how Alibaba says Qwen 2.5-Max stacks up against the competition ... Click to enlarge\n\nGiven the fervor around DeepSeek, we feel compelled to emphasize that Alibaba is drawing comparisons against V3 and not the R1 model that has the world abuzz. This might also explain the comparison to GPT-4o rather than OpenAI's flagship o1 models.\n\nIn any case, the announcement further fuels the perception that, despite ongoing efforts to stifle Chinese AI development by the West, the US lead in AI may not be as large as previously thought. And the perception that the countless billions upon billions of dollars demanded by Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence looks a little greedy.\n\nSpeeds and feeds or lack there of\n\nUnfortunately, beyond performance claims, API access, and a web-based chatbot, Alibaba's Qwen team is being rather tight-lipped about its latest model release. Unlike DeepSeek, whose models are available to freely download and use if you don't want to rely on DeepSeek's apps or cloud, Alibaba has not released Qwen 2.5 Max. It's available to access from Alibaba's servers.\n\nWhat we do know so far is Qwen 2.5 Max is a large-scale mixture of expert (MoE) model that was trained on a corpus of 20 trillion tokens before being further refined using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.\n\nAs the name suggests, MoE models like the Mistral series and DeepSeek's V3 and R1 comprise several artificial experts, if you will, that have been trained to handle specific tasks, such as coding or math.\n\nMoE models have become increasingly popular among model builders to decouple parameter count from actual performance. Because only a portion of the model is active for any given request \u2013 there's no need to activate the entire neural network to tackle a query, just the \"expert\" parts relevant to the question \u2013 it's now possible to increase parameter count without compromising throughput.\n\nThat is to say, rather than running an input query through the entire multi-billion-parameter network, performing all those calculations per token, only query-relevant layers are used, meaning outputs are generated faster.\n\nAt this point, Alibaba hasn't disclosed just how big Qwen 2.5 Max is. However we do know the previous Qwen Max model was around 100 billion parameters in size.\n\nThe Register reached out to Alibaba for comment; we'll let you know if we hear back. In the meantime we asked Qwen 2.5 Max, via its online chatbot form, to share its specs, and it doesn't appear to know much about itself either. But even if it did spit out a number, we're not sure we'd believe it.\n\nPerformance at what cost\n\nUnlike many previous Qwen models, we may never get hold of Qwen 2.5 Max's neural network weights. On the Alibaba Cloud website, the model is listed as being proprietary, which might explain why the Chinese super-corp is sharing so little about the model.\n\nNot disclosing parameter counts and other key details is par for the course for many model builders, including Alibaba has been similarly tight-lipped with regard to its proprietary Qwen Turbo and Qwen Plus models.\n\nThe lack of details makes evaluating model performance somewhat challenging as performance has to be weighted against cost. A model may out perform another in benchmarks, but if it costs 3-4x more to run, it may not be worth the hassle. This certainly appears to be the case with Qwen 2.5 Max.\n\nFor the moment, Alibaba's website has API access to the model listed at $10 per million input tokens and $30 for every million tokens generated. Compare that to GPT-4o, for which OpenAI is charging $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens, or half that if you opt for its batch processing.\n\nWith that said, Qwen 2.5 Max is still cheaper than OpenAI's flagship o1 model which will run you $15 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens generated.\n\nA growing family\n\nAs mentioned, Alibaba's latest Qwen model is only the latest in a string of LLMs released by the Chinese mega-biz since 2023. Its most recent generation of models, which bear the Qwen 2.5 name, began trickling out in September, with Alibaba openly releasing weights for its 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32, and 72-billion-parameter versions.\n\nPit against its contemporaries, Alibaba claimed the largest of these models could go toe-to-toe and in some cases best Meta's far larger 405B Llama model. But again, we recommend taking these claims with a grain of salt here.\n\nAlongside its general-purpose models, Alibaba also released the weights for several math and code-optimized LLMs and extended access to a pair of proprietary models called Qwen Plus and Qwen Turbo, which boasted alleged performance within spitting distance of GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.\n\nIn December, it detailed its OpenAI o1 style \"thinking\" model called QwQ. And then this week, leading up to the Qwen 2.5 Max launch, the cloud provider announced a trio of open vision language models (VLMs) weighing in at 3, 7, and 72-billion-parameters in size. Alibaba contends the largest of these models are competitive with the likes of Google's Gemini 2, OpenAI's GPT-4o, and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, at least in vision benchmarks anyway.\n\nIf that weren't enough, this week also saw Alibaba roll out upgraded versions of its 7 and 14-billion-parameter Qwen 2.5 models, which boost their context window \u2014 essentially their short term memory \u2014 to a million tokens.\n\nLonger context windows can be particularly useful for retrieval augmented generation, aka RAG, enabling models to parse larger quantities of information from documents without getting lost.\n\nQuestions and concerns remain\n\nBut for all the hype Chinese model builders have enjoyed and market volatility they've caused over the past week, questions and concerns over censorship and privacy persist.\n\nAs we pointed out with DeepSeek, user data collected by its online services will be storied in China, per its privacy policy. It's a similar story with Alibaba's Qwen Chat, which may store data in either its Singapore or Chinese datacenters.\n\nThis might be a major concern for some, but for others it poses a legitimate risk. Posting on X earlier this week, OpenAI API dev Steve Heidel quipped, \"Americans sure love giving their data away to the CCP in exchange for free stuff.\"\n\nConcerns have also been raised about censorship of controversial topics that may paint the Beijing regime in an unfavorable light. Just as we've seen with previous Chinese models, both DeepSeek and Alibaba will leave out information on sensitive topics, stop generation prematurely, or outright refuse to answer questions regarding topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre or the political status of Taiwan. \u00ae",

            "content": "Days after DeepSeek took the internet by storm, Chinese tech company Alibaba announced Qwen 2.5-Max, the latest of its LLM series. The unveiling of this open-source agent can easily be perceived as a direct challenge to DeepSeek and domestic rivals. The release is on the first day of the Lunar New Year when most Chinese people have taken time off work to celebrate and spend time with their families. Alibaba seems to be sending the message that they are hard at work while their competition takes the day off.\n\n\n\nAs we've seen, DeepSeek's emergence has been nothing short of disruptive and Alibaba's new release is sure to cause a stir as well. DeepSeek introduced the R1 model, which delivers performance comparable to leading models like OpenAI's ChatGPT but at a fraction of the development cost. The impact of DeepSeek's innovation was profound, leading to a substantial decline in the market value of major tech companies, including a $593 billion drop for Nvidia\u2014the largest in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThe latest from Alibaba comes when the AI industry is witnessing a surge in open-source contributions, allowing researchers and developers worldwide to access and build upon its technology. This move has been lauded for promoting transparency and collaboration in AI development. However, it also puts the power of AI freely into anyone\u2019s hands, which could lead to numerous safety and privacy issues.\n\nScalability and open source\n\nWith an emphasis on the model's scalability, Qwen 2.5 has been pre-trained on over 20 trillion tokens and further refined through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. The company has announced the availability of Qwen 2.5's API through Alibaba Cloud, inviting developers and businesses to integrate its advanced capabilities into their applications.\n\nSimilar to DeepSeek\u2019s approach, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 is built upon the \u201cmix of experts\u201d architecture and aims to not only match but surpass the capabilities of DeepSeek's offerings. This design allows the model to selectively engage different subsets of its parameters, enhancing computational efficiency and enabling the handling of more complex tasks without a proportional increase in resource consumption.\n\nWhat's next\n\nIt's easy to think that with the rise of these entities aiming to develop more efficient and powerful models, we will continue to see more open-source models unveiled shortly. The ultimate beneficiaries will likely be users who will experience increasingly sophisticated AI applications without the barriers of other chatbots within the category. Alibaba is carefully positioning itself as a key player in democratizing AI.\n\nBy embracing innovative architectures and open-source principles, Alibaba is responding to the challenges posed by nimble startups like DeepSeek and contributing to the broader advancement of AI technology.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",

The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth.\n\n\n\nStrength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business. However, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern.

            "content": "This week in artificial intelligence models and tools, Microsoft announced that DeepSeek R1 is available on Azure AI Foundry, and Alibaba released a model that it said is better than DeepSeek. Meanwhile, Meta launched a memory feature, and Google announced new Gemini Live capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Adds DeepSeek\n\nMicrosoft is making an AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek available to its Azure cloud customers.\n\nThe software giant said in a Wednesday (Jan. 29) blog post that DeepSeek R1, the startup\u2019s reasoning model, is joining the Azure AI Foundry, a one-stop-shop platform for designing, customizing and managing AI solutions. R1 will be among the more than 1,800 models available for use in the foundry.\n\nDeepSeek R1 on Azure resides on a \u201ctrusted, scalable and enterprise-ready platform\u201d backed by the tech giant\u2019s reliability, per the post.\n\n\u201cR1 offers a powerful, cost-efficient model that allows more users to harness state-of-the-art AI capabilities with minimal infrastructure investment,\u201d wrote Asha Sharma, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of AI platform, in the post.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek caused chip stocks to tumble Monday (Jan. 27) amid media reports that it only spent $5.6 million and used about 2,000 slower H800 Nvidia chips to train its V3 model. Over several days, DeepSeek shot to the top of the Apple App Store\u2019s most downloaded apps.\n\nHowever, some analysts said other costs were not included in the tally. Microsoft and OpenAI also suspected DeepSeek of using a technique called distillation, in which outputs of a larger model \u2014 from OpenAI \u2014 are used to guide the smaller model to achieve similar performance. This would violate OpenAI\u2019s terms of service.\n\nThere were also concerns about Chinese censorship on DeepSeek, but since it is open-source, developers can offset this by making changes to the model.\n\nSharma said in the blog post that DeepSeek R1 has \u201cundergone rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations, including automated assessments of model behavior and extensive security reviews to mitigate potential risks.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Microsoft\u2019s platform has built-in content filtering and a safety evaluation system to test applications before deployment.\n\nAlibaba Releases AI Model That It Says Beats DeepSeek\n\nChinese tech giant Alibaba released Tuesday (Jan. 28) the latest version of its AI model, Qwen2.5-Max, and said in a blog post that it outperforms DeepSeek and other top AI models on key benchmarks.\n\nAlibaba said in the post that Qwen2.5-Max held its own against DeepSeek V3, Llama 3.1-405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, LiveCodeBench, LiveBench and Arena-Hard benchmarks.\n\nMMLU-Pro tests knowledge through college-level problems, GPQA-Diamond tests graduate-level capabilities, LiveCodeBench assesses coding capabilities, LiveBench tests general capabilities and Arena-Hard approximates human preferences.\n\nQwen2.5-Max was pre-trained on 20 trillion tokens, according to the post.\n\nAlibaba is letting users try out its latest model through Qwen Chat, the post said. Most foundation AI models add a chatbot user interface to make it easier to use.\n\nQwen2.5-Max\u2019s API is available through Alibaba Cloud, which is the largest cloud computing platform in China and Asia Pacific, and one of the largest in the world.\n\nMeta AI Gets \u2018Memories\u2019\n\nMeta is rolling out a new feature in Meta AI that lets it remember details when users interact with it one-on-one, according to a Monday press release. Users can tell Meta AI that they like hiking and swimming, and future responses will remember it.\n\nMeta AI can also pick up on details within context. If a user asks for breakfast ideas and Meta AI recommends an omelet, the user can respond with a preference for vegan food only. Meta AI will remember that the user is vegan, which will inform future food recommendations, the release said.\n\nThe memory feature is coming to Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp for iOS and Android devices in the United States and Canada. The memory feature doesn\u2019t work in group chats. Users can delete memories at any time.\n\nMeta AI is also getting more personalized on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.\n\nUsers can ask Meta AI to recommend a social activity this weekend. The AI assistant will look at the user\u2019s location in their Facebook profile, as well as what posts or videos the user looked at, to determine their interests. If the user looked at music video clips of country music, for example, Meta AI could recommend a country music show.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini Live Goes Multimodal\n\nGoogle announced in a Jan. 22 blog post that Gemini Live will now be able to accept images, files and YouTube videos. The AI chatbot lets users converse with the AI assistant in a \u201cfree-flowing\u201d manner and allows uploading of images, videos and files to further deepen the conversation.\n\nGemini Live is reminiscent of OpenAI\u2019s advanced voice mode for ChatGPT, which was released in September. Both chatbots will let users talk to them in natural language on a wide range of topics.\n\n\u201cIt is especially helpful when you want some AI-powered help to brainstorm new ideas, organize your thoughts, or simplify complex topics,\u201d Sissie Hsiao, Google vice president and general manager of the Gemini app and speech, wrote in the blog post.\n\nThe multimodal capability already rolled out to Samsung Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as Google\u2019s own Pixel 9 devices. In the coming weeks, the capability will be expanded to more Android devices. In coming months, Google said Project Astra capabilities, such as screen-sharing and live video streaming, will arrive, first in the Gemini mobile app on Android and Samsung Galaxy S25.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

            "content": "DeepSeek has shaken the AI industry with its new R1 model, which aims to compete against OpenAI's ChatGPT. While the Chinese AI chatbot is all the hype these days, another major contender has entered the competition, claiming that its AI model is better than that of DeepSeek. Alibaba has officially launched its Qwen 2.5 AI model and claims that it can outperform DeepSeek-V3 along with other leading AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nAlibaba unveils Qwen 2.5 AI model, positioning itself as a major competitor to DeepSeek and ChatGPT\n\nDeepSeek entered the AI industry earlier this week with its new AI model, and it has surpassed ChatGPT to become the most downloaded AI chatbot in various regions, including the United States. With Alibaba stepping into the same field, we can safely presume that China is desperate to take the lead in the category. According to Alibaba's cloud division, \u201cQwen 2.5-Max surpasses GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1-405B in almost every aspect,\u201d referring to the dominance against Meta and OpenAI (via Reuters).\n\nThe rapid development of new AI models has intensified the competition in the industry, and the race to become number one has impacted investor confidence in the United States. Companies like NVIDIA have also lost their position in the stock market, making investors reassess their investments in major AI tech giants in the United States.\n\nDeepSeek's success in the industry is making rivals step up their game to better compete against the new entrants. Furthermore, existing companies have also released updated AI models to showcase their newer capabilities. For instance, ByteDance unveiled its upgraded AI model and claims it outperforms OpenAI's o1 in AIME, a key benchmark measuring AI comprehension and understanding of complex instructions.\n\nWith Alibaba's new Qwen 2.5 AI model, we expect the competition to pick up additional heat, which will be evident in the coming months. The previous version of the DeepSeek-V3 also waged a price war for AI models in China. Since DeepSeek-V2 was open source and relatively cheap compared to the competition, with an estimated $0.14 for a million tokens, it led Alibaba to slash its prices by 97 percent on a wide range of AI models. Baidu and Tencent followed suit and cut their prices as well.\n\nWe have to take note that DeepSeek only has a handful of users compared to Alibaba's hundreds of thousands of employees. Moreover, it only took $5.6 million for DeepSeek to develop the new AI technology against billions of dollars spent in the United States. It remains to be seen how Alibaba's Qwen performs against the likes of DeepSeek and OpenAI and how the company is planning to position itself in the market.",

Learn More\n\nAlibaba Cloud unveiled its Qwen2.5-Max model today, marking the second major artificial intelligence breakthrough from China in less than a week, further rattling U.S. technology markets and intensifying concerns about America\u2019s eroding AI leadership.\n\nThe new model outperforms DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model, whose success sent Nvidia\u2019s stock plunging 17% on Monday, in several key benchmarks including Arena-Hard, LiveBench and LiveCodeBench. Qwen2.5-Max also demonstrates competitive results against industry leaders like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet in tests of advanced reasoning and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe have been building Qwen2.5-Max, a large MoE LLM pretrained on massive data and post-trained with curated SFT and RLHF recipes,\u201d Alibaba Cloud announced in a blog post. The company emphasized its model\u2019s efficiency, having trained it on over 20 trillion tokens while using a mixture-of-experts architecture that requires significantly fewer computational resources than traditional approaches.\n\nThe timing of these back-to-back Chinese AI releases has deepened Wall Street\u2019s anxiety about U.S. technological supremacy. Both announcements came during President Trump\u2019s first week back in office, prompting questions about the effectiveness of U.S. chip export controls meant to slow China\u2019s AI advancement.\n\nQwen2.5-Max outperforms major AI models across key benchmarks, including a significant lead in Arena-Hard testing, where it scored 89.4%. (Source: Alibaba Cloud)\n\n\n\nHow Qwen2.5-Max could reshape enterprise AI strategies\n\nFor CIOs and technical leaders, Qwen2.5-Max\u2019s architecture represents a potential shift in enterprise AI deployment strategies. Its mixture-of-experts approach demonstrates that competitive AI performance can be achieved without massive GPU clusters, potentially reducing infrastructure costs by 40-60% compared to traditional large language model deployments.\n\nThe technical specifications show sophisticated engineering choices that matter for enterprise adoption. The model activates only specific neural network components for each task, allowing organizations to run advanced AI capabilities on more modest hardware configurations.\n\nThis efficiency-first approach could reshape enterprise AI roadmaps. Rather than investing heavily in data center expansions and GPU clusters, technical leaders might prioritize architectural optimization and efficient model deployment. The model\u2019s strong performance in code generation (LiveCodeBench: 38.7%) and reasoning tasks (Arena-Hard: 89.4%) suggests it could handle many enterprise use cases while requiring significantly less computational overhead.\n\nHowever, technical decision-makers should carefully consider factors beyond raw performance metrics. Questions about data sovereignty, API reliability and long-term support will likely influence adoption decisions, especially given the complex regulatory landscape surrounding Chinese AI technologies.\n\nQwen2.5-Max achieves top scores across key AI benchmarks, including 94.5% accuracy in mathematical reasoning tests, outperforming major competitors. (Source: Alibaba Cloud)\n\nChina\u2019s AI leap: how efficiency is driving innovation\n\nQwen2.5-Max\u2019s architecture reveals how Chinese companies are adapting to U.S. restrictions. This efficiency-focused innovation suggests China may have found a sustainable path to AI advancement despite limited access to cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe technical achievement here cannot be overstated. While U.S. companies have focused on scaling up through brute computational force \u2014 exemplified by OpenAI\u2019s estimated use of over 32,000 high-end GPUs for its latest models \u2014 Chinese companies are finding success through architectural innovation and efficient resource use.\n\nU.S. export controls: catalysts for China\u2019s AI renaissance?\n\nThese developments force a fundamental reassessment of how technological advantage can be maintained in an interconnected world. U.S. export controls, designed to preserve American leadership in AI, may have inadvertently accelerated Chinese innovation in efficiency and architecture.\n\n\u201cThe scaling of data and model size not only showcases advancements in model intelligence but also reflects our unwavering commitment to pioneering research,\u201d Alibaba Cloud stated in its announcement. The company emphasized its focus on \u201cenhancing the thinking and reasoning capabilities of large language models through the innovative application of scaled reinforcement learning.\u201d\n\nWhat Qwen2.5-Max means for enterprise AI adoption\n\nFor enterprise customers, these developments could herald a more accessible AI future. Qwen2.5-Max is already available through Alibaba Cloud\u2019s API services, offering capabilities similar to leading U.S. models at potentially lower costs. This accessibility could accelerate AI adoption across industries, particularly in markets where cost has been a barrier.\n\nHowever, security concerns persist. The U.S. Commerce Department has launched a review of both DeepSeek and Qwen2.5-Max to assess potential national security implications. The ability of Chinese companies to develop advanced AI capabilities despite export controls raises questions about the effectiveness of current regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe future of AI: efficiency over power?\n\nThe global AI landscape is shifting rapidly. The assumption that advanced AI development requires massive computational resources and cutting-edge hardware is being challenged. As Chinese companies demonstrate the possibility of achieving similar results through efficient innovation, the industry may be forced to reconsider its approach to AI advancement.\n\nFor U.S. technology leaders, the challenge is now twofold: responding to immediate market pressures while developing sustainable strategies for long-term competition in an environment where hardware advantages may no longer guarantee leadership.\n\nThe next few months will be crucial as the industry adjusts to this new reality. With both Chinese and U.S. companies promising further advances, the global race for AI supremacy enters a new phase \u2014 one where efficiency and innovation may prove more important than raw computational power.",

            "content": "|\n\nAlibaba Cloud has unveiled its latest visual-language model, Qwen2.5-VL, which significantly enhances its predecessor, Qwen2-VL. This open-source, multimodal model is offered in various sizes, ranging from 3 billion, 7 billion to 72 billion parameters, and includes both base and instruction-tuned versions. The flagship model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, is now accessible through the Qwen Chat platform, while the entire Qwen2.5-VL series is available on Hugging Face and Alibaba\u2019s open-source community Model Scope.\n\nQwen2.5-VL demonstrates remarkable multimodal capabilities, excelling in advanced visual comprehension of texts, charts, diagrams, graphics, and layouts within images. It can also understand videos longer than an hour and answer video-related questions, while accurately identifying specific segments down to the exact second. Additionally, the model can generate structured outputs, such as in JSON format, turning unstructured data from scans of invoices, forms, or tables into organized information, which is particularly useful for automating the processing of financial reports or legal documents.\n\nBy combining parsing and localization capabilities, Qwen2.5-VL can also serve as a visual agent to facilitate the execution of simple tasks on computers and mobile devices, such as checking the weather and booking a flight ticket, through directing the use of various tools.\n\nQwen2.5-VL demo video with the prompt \u201cPlease help me book a one-way ticket in the bookings app. The starting point is Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, and the ending point is Beijing Capital Airport on January 28th\u201d\n\nNotably, the flagship model Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct achieves competitive performance in a series of benchmarks covering domains and tasks including document and diagrams reading, general visual question answering, college-level math, video understanding, and visual agent.\n\nTo improve the multimodal performance, researchers behind the model has implemented dynamic resolution and frame rate training to improve video understanding. They have also introduced a more streamlined and efficient visual encoder. This has significantly improved both training and inference speeds by utilizing Window Attention mechanisms within a dynamic Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. These innovations make Qwen2.5-VL a versatile and powerful tool for complex multimodal applications across sectors.\n\nExpanding Context Input to 1 Million Tokens\n\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its latest version of the Qwen large language model, known as Qwen2.5-1M. This open-source iteration is distinguished by its capability to process long context inputs, with the ability to handle up to 1 million tokens.\n\nGenerally, the capacity to manage longer contexts allows models to address more complex real-world scenarios that demand substantial information processing or generation. As a result, expanding the context window of large language models (LLMs) can better handle tasks such as long-form document digestion and generation, making long-context LLMs emerged as a new trend.\n\nThe release this time includes two versions of instruction-tuned models, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M, which feature 7 billion and 14 billion parameters, respectively. Both versions were made available on Hugging Face, and their technical report has also been published.\n\nIn addition, the cloud and AI pioneer has released a corresponding inference framework optimized for processing long contexts on Github. This framework is tailored to help developers deploy the Qwen2.5-1M series more cost-effectively. By leveraging techniques such as length extrapolation and sparse attention, the framework can process 1-million-token inputs with speeds 3 to 7 times faster than traditional approaches, offering a potent solution for developing applications that require long-context processing with more efficiency.\n\nPerformance of Qwen2.5 Models on RULER\n\nThe Qwen2.5-1M series has demonstrated impressive performance in benchmarks focused on long-context capabilities, such as RULER, LV-Eval, and Longbench-Chat. These remarkable results indicate that Qwen2.5-1M provides a robust open-source alternative for tasks demanding extensive context inputs.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the 128K version, the Qwen2.5-1M series boasts significantly enhanced long-context capabilities, achieved through advanced strategies in long-context pre-training and post-training. Techniques such as long data synthesis, progressive pre-training, and multi-stage supervised fine-tuning are employed to boost long-context performance while effectively reducing training costs.",

They urge the formation of global safety protocols and emphasise the necessity of evaluating and understanding the potential dangers of self-replicating AI systems.\n\nThey highlighted, \"We hope our findings can serve as a timely alert for human society to put more effort into understanding and evaluating the potential risks of frontier AI systems, and form international synergy to work out effective safety guardrails as early as possible.\"\n\nExperts believe that failing to establish effective regulations promptly may result in losing control over these powerful AI systems, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences.",

But one of its top domestic rivals, Alibaba, isn\u2019t sitting idly by.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Qwen team on Monday released a new family of AI models, Qwen2.5-VL, that can perform a number of text and image analysis tasks. The models can parse files, understand videos, and count objects in images, as well as control a PC \u2014 similar to the model powering OpenAI\u2019s recently launched Operator.\n\nPer the Qwen team\u2019s benchmarking, the best Qwen2.5-VL model beats OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash on a range of video understanding, math, document analysis, and question-answering evaluations.\n\nImage Credits:Alibaba\n\nQwen2.5-VL, which is available to test in Alibaba\u2019s Qwen Chat app and to download from AI dev platform Hugging Face, can analyze charts and graphics, extract data from scans of invoices and forms, and \u201ccomprehend\u201d multiple-hours-long videos, the Qwen team says. Qwen2.5-VL can also recognize \u201cIPs from film and TV series, as well as a wide variety of products,\u201d per the team \u2014 suggesting that the models might\u2019ve been trained in part on copyrighted works.\n\nQwen2.5-VL, being AI developed by a Chinese company, has certain restrictions on the topics it will discuss \u2014 at least in Qwen Chat. When I asked the largest and most capable Qwen2.5-VL model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, to talk about \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Qwen Chat threw an error message.\n\nChina\u2019s internet regulator benchmarks many models developed in the country to ensure their responses \u201cembody core socialist values.\u201d Many Chinese AI systems decline to respond to topics that might raise the ire of regulators, such as Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.\n\nOne of Qwen2.5-VL\u2019s more interesting features is its ability to interact with software \u2014 both on PCs and mobile devices. A video posted on X by Philipp Schmid, a technical lead at Hugging Face, showed Qwen2.5-VL launching the Booking.com app for Android and booking a flight from Chongqing to Beijing.\n\nIn the video below, a Qwen2.5-VL model controls apps on a Linux desktop \u2014 but doesn\u2019t seem to accomplish much beyond switching tabs. Perhaps tellingly, Qwen\u2019s benchmarking shows Qwen2.5-VL scoring poorly on OSWorld, a benchmark that tries to mimic a real computer environment.\n\nThe two smaller, less sophisticated models in the Qwen2.5-VL series, Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, are available under a permissive license. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B, however, is under Alibaba\u2019s custom license, which requires that companies and devs with more than 100 million monthly active users request permission from Qwen/Alibaba before deploying the model commercially.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.\n\nMarket Outlook 2025\n\nOn December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year\u2019s outcome for the country and globally.\n\nThe report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues.\n\nLakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Chinese e-commerce and cloud behemoth Alibaba stock (NYSE:BABA) stock has gained about 12% since early 2024 but remains down over 70% from its 2020 highs. The stock trades at a reasonable $85 per share, equivalent to less than 10x projected FY\u201925 earnings. In comparison, Amazon trades at approximately 36x forward earnings. Alibaba also holds about $50 billion in net cash\u2014roughly a quarter of its market value\u2014bringing the ex-cash multiple down to under 8x. So, what factors are holding the stock back, and what are the potential catalysts for recovery?\n\nWhat\u2019s Held Alibaba Stock Back of Late?\n\nAlibaba reported better-than-expected Q2 FY\u201925 results, with revenue rising 5% year over year to 236.5 billion yuan (approximately $33.7 billion) and net income surging 58% to 43.9 billion yuan (around $6 billion). However, China\u2019s retail market remains weak due to mixed consumer sentiment and slowing economic growth following the real estate crisis. This has impacted spending, particularly on discretionary items. Increasing competition in the e-commerce space has also proved a challenge for the company. PDD, the owner of discount platforms Pinduoduo and Temu, has gained traction as Chinese consumers have turned a bit more value-conscious on account of the sluggish economy. Revenue from Alibaba\u2019s Taobao and Tmall online marketplaces grew by just 1% year-over-year to $14.1 billion in Q4 FY\u201924. Concerns about a mixed recovery in consumption could linger, potentially exacerbated by higher U.S. tariffs and the risk of an escalating U.S.-China trade war as Donald Trump assumes the U.S. presidency.\n\nTrends That Could Help Alibaba\n\nSince late September 2024, China has introduced substantial stimulus measures and interest rate cuts, which could help to stimulate economic growth and consumer spending. Alibaba has also been tweaking its fee model and recently replaced its annual fixed service fee for vendors with a 0.6% software service fee on gross merchandise value for transactions on Tmall and Taobao. This move could enhance revenue from its core customer management services, following significant investments in its platforms and technology. The company\u2019s digital marketing tool, Quanzhantui, is also expected to boost monetization for Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cross-border e-commerce platforms, AliExpress and Trendyol, have emerged as key growth drivers, with revenues soaring nearly 29% to $4.5 billion in the most recent quarter, led by the strong performance of initiatives such as the AliExpress Choice program which offers free shipping and other services. Growth in the international business could help soften the weakness in China in the interim. Alibaba is also adjusting its broader e-commerce strategy to emulate value-focused competitors like Pinduoduo.\n\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing business saw a slowdown post the Covid-19 pandemic due to waning demand for computing power associated with remote work, and remote education, things have been getting better. Over the last quarter, the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group has returned to growth, with sales rising 7% year-over-year to 29.6 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), driven by strong public cloud growth and a triple-digit increase in AI-related product revenue. There\u2019s a possibility that the company\u2019s AI initiatives could potentially see backing from the Chinese government, amid U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor chip exports to China and the growing geopolitical importance of AI. In the AI space, Alibaba is developing open-source large language models, allowing developers greater flexibility to build custom solutions using its technology. This strategy could encourage developers to adopt Alibaba\u2019s cloud services for deploying these models.\n\nNotably, BABA stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were -49% in 2021, -26% in 2022, -11% in 2023, and 12% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BABA face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2013 or will it see a recovery?\n\nWe estimate Alibaba\u2019s valuation at about $108 per share \u2013 indicating a 27% upside from the market price of about $85 per share.

This news can increase share price without largely affecting a company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nIs BABA Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, the analysts\u2019 consensus rating for Alibaba is Strong Buy based on 11 Buy and one Hold ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $121.33, a high of $144, and a low of $105. This represents a potential 35.88% upside for BABA shares.\n\nSee more BABA stock analyst ratings",

This approach processes million-token inputs three to seven times faster than traditional methods, with outputs up to 8,000 tokens long. However, this requires the models to identify crucial passages in context documents - a task that current language models often struggle with.\n\nIn testing, both the 14B model and Qwen2.5-Turbo achieved perfect accuracy when finding hidden numbers in very long documents. The smaller 7B model also performed well, with only minor errors. However, these benchmarks mainly test information retrieval - similar to a costly Ctrl+F - rather than deeper understanding of content.\n\nAd\n\nAd THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. \u2713 Weekly \u2713 Free \u2713 Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty\n\nShare Recommend our article Share\n\nThe advantages of large context windows over RAG systems are not straightforward. Long context windows are easier to use and more flexible, but RAG architectures, which pull information from external databases during inference, often work more precisely and effectively with much smaller context windows of about 128,000 tokens\n\nComplex context testing shows promising results\n\nIn more demanding tests like RULER, LV-Eval and LongbenchChat, the million-token models outperformed their 128K counterparts, especially with sequences longer than 64K tokens. The 14B model even scored above 90 points in RULER - a first for the Qwen series - consistently beating GPT-4o mini across multiple datasets.\n\nFor shorter texts, the million-token models matched the performance of their 128K counterparts, showing no trade-offs in handling brief content.\n\nUsers can try this and other Alibaba models through Qwen Chat, Alibaba's ChatGPT-like interface, or through a demo on Hugging Face. Along with fellow Chinese company Deepseek's open-source models, Qwen is challenging established U.S. providers by offering similar capabilities at lower costs.\n\nAd",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ServiceNow, Inc.

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 2020 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) at the end of third quarter, which represents 14% year-over-year growth in customers. ServiceNow had 15 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV and six deals of more than $10 million. It closed 96 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 44 new Now Assist customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six with more than $5 million and two with more than $10 million. It is riding on an expanding partner base. However, NOW is suffering from persistent inflation, stiff competition, and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on ServiceNow here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba shares have gained +23.7% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry\u2019s gain of +43.8%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth.\n\n\n\nStrength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business. However, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Union Pacific have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+3.7% vs. -0.6%). The company is looking to cut costs to combat the revenue weakness. In the meantime, the railroad operator continues paying dividends. UNP is also active on the buyback front. UNP repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion in 2024. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\nHowever, Union Pacific is suffering big time as ecommerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment.\n\n\n\nReduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern. Due to these headwinds, volumes declined 1% year over year in 2023. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated 220 basis points in 2023, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>)\n\n\n\nNatural Health Trends shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (-13% vs. +23.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $55.61 million is facing rising costs and regulatory hurdles limit growth. Cash flow constraints and intense competition add pressure.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Natural Health maintains strong liquidity with $46.3 million in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2024, and generated $0.5 million in operational cash flow (excluding tax payments) year to date. Operating losses improved from $1.4 million to $0.9 million year to date, supported by robust gross margins of 74.1%.\n\n\n\nThe company leverages market leadership in Hong Kong and China (78% of revenue) but faces risks from weak consumer spending and overreliance on these regions. Efforts in product expansion, digital initiatives, and market diversification (e.g., Colombia entry) position it for growth, but declining active membership (-10.9% year over year) poses challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Health Trends here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Elevance Health, Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nStrategist Believes the Street is Underestimating the Tech Sector\n\nThe new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector.\n\nIves suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to \u201cgrab popcorn\u201d for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done.\n\nIves emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole.\n\nHe also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving.\n\nThe year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nStory Continues",

This update marks a significant step forward in Alibaba's development of multimodal AI tools.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/IZj1PUYycp\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 Qwen is back with something new! We've just rolled out Qwen Chat v0.2 after two weeks of hard work, and it's packed with awesome new features! \ud83c\udf1f Now you can explore web search , create stunning videos, and generate amazing images \u2013 all in one\u2026 pic.twitter.com/zQ4O4eH9c0 \u2014 Qwen (@Alibaba_Qwen) January 24, 2025\n\nThe New Feature: Qwen Chat v0.2\n\nQwen Chat v0.2 integrates three major functionalities:\n\nWeb Search: Users can now perform real-time web searches directly within the chat interface. Video Creation: The platform enables text-to-video generation, allowing users to create videos based on prompts. Image Generation: Users can generate high-quality images from text descriptions.\n\nThese additions complement existing capabilities such as document analysis, artifact creation, and image understanding, making Qwen Chat a versatile tool for both professional and creative tasks.\n\n\n\nAlibaba also has announced the release of its latest open-source language models, Qwen2.5-1M, which introduce groundbreaking capabilities in handling extended token contexts and faster processing speeds. These models are part of Alibaba's ongoing efforts to advance natural language processing technology.\n\nWe're leveling up the game with our latest open-source models, Qwen2.5-1M ! \ud83d\udca5 Now supporting a 1 MILLION TOKEN CONTEXT LENGTH \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nHere's what\u2019s new:\n\n\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Open Models: Meet Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M & Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M \u2014our first-ever models handling 1M-token contexts! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6rpt5bHpfO \u2014 Qwen (@Alibaba_Qwen) January 26, 2025\n\nThe Qwen2.5-1M series includes two models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M. Both models are designed to process an unprecedented 1 million tokens in a single context, making them suitable for tasks that require handling large-scale text inputs, such as document summarization, code analysis, and long-form content generation. This represents a significant leap in context length compared to most existing language models, which typically support token limits in the tens of thousands.\n\nTo complement the new models, Alibaba has also open-sourced an advanced inference framework based on vLLM (a high-performance serving system for large language models). This framework integrates sparse attention methods, enabling the models to process 1-million-token inputs with speeds 3 to 7 times faster than traditional approaches. Sparse attention optimizes how the model focuses on relevant parts of the input text, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.\n\nThe release includes detailed documentation in a technical report and blog post, providing insights into the architecture and performance of the Qwen2.5-1M series. Users can explore these models through various platforms: Alibaba\u2019s Qwen Chat for live interaction, Hugging Face for experimentation, and Modelscope for additional deployment options.\n\nAbout Qwen\n\nAlibaba Cloud developed Qwen Chat as part of its broader AI initiative to create accessible, high-performing tools. The Qwen model family includes various specialized models, such as Qwen2.5-Coder for programming and Qwen2-VL-Max for vision-language tasks. These models are known for their robust multilingual support and extended context length capabilities, with some models handling up to 128K tokens.\n\nWhen and Where?\n\nQwen Chat v0.2 was officially rolled out on January 26, 2025, as announced on Alibaba's official X (formerly Twitter) account. The platform is accessible via its dedicated web interface.\n\nHow It Works\n\nUsers can access these features through toggles in the chat interface:\n\nWeb search results are integrated into conversations.\n\nText-to-video and image generation tools allow direct input of prompts to create media outputs.\n\nExisting functionalities like document uploads and artifact creation remain available within the same interface.\n\nThis update represents Alibaba's continued commitment to advancing AI technology while preparing for further developments around the Chinese Spring Festival.",

            "content": "The Shifting Landscape of Alibaba\u2019s Potential\n\nIn the world of investing, it\u2019s easy to overlook a turnaround story \u2014 especially regarding Alibaba Group (BABA). Despite experiencing a dip in performance and stock value for several quarters, the company is positioned to bounce back significantly as the economic tides begin to shift in China.\n\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s challenges are well-documented, including struggles influenced by post-pandemic recovery and a troubled real estate market, significant growth signals are emerging. Retail sales in China recently rose by 3.7% year over year, marking a continuous growth trend that has persisted for two years. This positive momentum is complemented by an increase of 6.2% in industrial production, hinting that the economic recovery is accelerating.\n\nUndergoing strategic leadership changes, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce division is now under the guidance of its CEO, Eddie Wu, a sign that innovations are forthcoming. The company is also refocusing its efforts on key sectors like logistics and cloud computing, looking to capitalize on the booming artificial intelligence market, projected to grow at over 21% annually through 2034.\n\nDespite stock prices remaining down significantly from their peaks, analysts anticipate a 6% revenue growth this fiscal year and an 8% rise next year. Observers should not let prevailing pessimism cloud the undeniable signs of recovery and opportunity for Alibaba as it navigates a changing economic landscape. As China\u2019s GDP grows and e-commerce thrives, this might be a pivotal moment for savvy investors looking to capitalize on Alibaba\u2019s resurgence.\n\nThe Broader Implications of Alibaba\u2019s Resurgence\n\nAlibaba\u2019s potential resurgence holds significant implications not only for its investors but also for the broader landscape of global commerce and technology. As the company transitions through its challenges, it may redefine how e-commerce operates in emerging markets, particularly in Asia. With robust growth in retail sales and industrial output recently noted in China, this could signal a larger recovery phase for economies coping with post-pandemic realities.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba\u2019s renewed focus on innovation, especially within logistics and cloud computing, highlights an evolving trend where companies prioritize technological advancements to stay competitive. The projected 21% annual growth in artificial intelligence signifies a surge in demand for smart logistics and data analytics, which are becoming essential for efficiently meeting consumer needs. As companies like Alibaba embrace these technologies, the ripple effect could lead to increased efficiency across supply chains, transforming how goods are delivered globally.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s revival can influence social dynamics within China. Increased consumer spending could drive job creation and elevate living standards, ultimately enhancing consumer confidence. The implications extend internationally as Alibaba expands its footprint, presenting opportunities for strategic partnerships and collaborations across borders.\n\nIn summary, the potential turnaround of Alibaba is a microcosm of larger economic trends, marking a pivotal moment that could reshape narratives around global trade, innovation, and cultural engagement in commerce. The world will be watching closely as Alibaba navigates these waters, perhaps paving the way for a new era of e-commerce.\n\nUnlocking Opportunities: Alibaba\u2019s Path to Recovery\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Resilient Comeback in a Recovering Market\n\nAs the landscape of the Chinese economy evolves, Alibaba Group (BABA) is emerging as a potential growth story for investors. Despite facing challenges over the past several quarters, including a sluggish post-pandemic recovery and real estate sector woes, recent data suggests that Alibaba is on the brink of a significant turnaround.\n\nKey Economic Indicators\n\nRecent reports detail a 3.7% year-over-year increase in retail sales across China, indicating a robust recovery in consumer spending. This trend, coupled with a 6.2% rise in industrial production, underscores the acceleration of economic activity. These developments signal that Alibaba, with its extensive e-commerce platform, is well-positioned to benefit from this revitalized consumer confidence.\n\nStrategic Leadership and Innovation\n\nIn a bid to navigate these changes and revitalize its operations, Alibaba has undergone strategic leadership transitions. Under the leadership of CEO Eddie Wu, the company is intensifying its focus on critical areas such as logistics and cloud computing. This pivot aims to leverage the burgeoning artificial intelligence market, which is anticipated to grow over 21% annually through 2034.\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nDespite the current downturn in stock prices, there is optimism among analysts regarding Alibaba\u2019s future. Predictions indicate 6% revenue growth for the fiscal year, with an even more encouraging 8% growth forecasted for the following year. This optimistic outlook reflects the potential for recovery and growth, suggesting that Alibaba may be on the cusp of a significant rebound as the economic conditions improve.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Alibaba\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong Market Presence: Alibaba holds a dominant position in China\u2019s e-commerce landscape.\n\n\u2013 Economic Recovery Momentum: The rise in retail sales and industrial production signals a favorable economic environment.\n\n\u2013 Leadership Focus: Strategic changes under CEO Eddie Wu can drive innovation and operational efficiency.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Stock Performance Volatility: Stocks are significantly lower than historical peaks, which may deter some investors.\n\n\u2013 Regulatory Concerns: Alibaba has faced scrutiny from regulators, which could affect future operations and growth prospects.\n\n\u2013 Market Competition: Increased competition in e-commerce and cloud services may pose challenges.\n\nUse Cases for Alibaba\u2019s Services\n\n1. E-commerce Expansion: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can leverage Alibaba\u2019s platforms to expand their market reach, both domestically and internationally.\n\n2. Cloud Solutions: Businesses can utilize Alibaba Cloud for scalable infrastructure, enhancing their operational capabilities.\n\n3. Logistics Optimization: Companies can improve their supply chain management through Alibaba\u2019s logistics services, benefiting from its extensive network.\n\nMarket Trends and Predictions\n\nWith China\u2019s GDP expected to continue its upward trajectory, e-commerce growth is projected to remain strong. Analysts believe Alibaba\u2019s focus on logistics and cloud computing, coupled with its innovative strategies, places it in a favorable position to capture market opportunities. As the company aligns itself with evolving consumer preferences, it could emerge as a key player in both domestic and global markets.\n\nPricing and Accessibility\n\nAlibaba offers a range of services across its platforms, catering to various price points depending on the business needs. From affordable e-commerce solutions for SMEs to advanced cloud computing services, Alibaba aims to provide accessible options that can meet the demands of diverse clients.\n\nIn summary, despite facing recent hurdles, Alibaba Group is poised for a comeback as the economic landscape shifts in its favor. Investors looking for emerging opportunities should consider Alibaba\u2019s strategic initiatives and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

            "content": "India's manufacturing sector faces a stark reality when compared to China. On Sunday, an X user argued that the cost gap between the two nations is so wide it may never close. Citing the example of a 9W LED bulb, the user pointed out that Chinese manufacturers, through platforms like Alibaba, can land bulbs in India at Rs 31-40, including shipping, whereas Indian-made bulbs cost Rs 60-70.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhen you visit https://t.co/TPIrkYyqoV, you come to the sad realization, that we are not going to catch up with China. Not in this century at least. Probably not even the next.\n\n\n\nCase in point is a simple 9W Led bulb.\n\n\n\nIn India, the cost of one bulb made by Indian manufacturers\u2026 \u2014 The Kaipullai (@thekaipullai) January 26, 2025\n\n\"When you visit http://Alibaba.com, you come to the sad realization, that we are not going to catch up with China. Not in this century at least. Probably not even the next. Case in point is a simple 9W Led bulb. In India, the cost of one bulb made by Indian manufacturers costs close to Rs 60-70,\" the person wrote on X.\n\nThe person said that China-based Alibaba is ready to ship the same bulb to India, at a unit price of Rs 16 to Rs 25 plus shipping costs of Rs 15. \"Even After including shipping costs, Chinese are able to land an led bulb in India at a cost which is 50% lower than a bulb made in India. The gulf between us is now so wide, that we can fit the whole of Russia within it.\"\n\nPrakash Dadlani, another social media user, agreed that China holds a significant edge in manufacturing but suggested a closer look at the numbers. \"Totally agree on China's far lead in manufacturing. There might be a miscalculation in the cost of transport as 25 rupees seems far too low. Also need to factor in duties. Regardless it\u2019s a shame if the manufacturing cost is 4-5x in Bharat, logically no reason for that. If indeed the gap is so wide it\u2019s a good opportunity to get into this line of manufacturing.\"\n\nDadlani also advocated for adopting protectionist policies to strengthen domestic production. \u201cChina has protected its economy from imports since day one. This allowed their manufacturing to grow with the support of a huge domestic market. India must consider similar measures,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "So many of the fun electric go-karts I\u2019ve found while window-shopping on Alibaba have been of the child-sized variety. To be fair, I\u2019m not opposed to folding my body in ways it shouldn\u2019t in service of a good time, but it\u2019d be nice to get the same experience while maintaining full blood flow to the extremities.\n\nThat\u2019s where today\u2019s find comes in, as a full-size electric go-kart that adults can enjoy, too! It\u2019s both awesome and weird, but perhaps for once, this week\u2019s honoree of the Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week is more of the former and less of the latter!\n\nI know everyone wants to see it in action, so I\u2019ve embedded a video of the kart at the end of this article. But before you make it all the way down there, let me hit you with the specs.\n\nIf the product page is to be believed, this four-wheeled wonder can hit a maximum speed of 30 km/h (18.8 mph) with two-wheel drive, and it rolls on 16-inch tires.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nAt 1.8 meters long, the go-kart is just a hair under 6 feet\u2014compact enough to stay nimble but spacious enough that adult riders won\u2019t have to fold themselves up like an intense game of Twister. I\u2019m all for getting bent into shape in the name of fun, but I usually save that for Saturday nights.\n\nPowering the buggy is a 60V and 20Ah lead acid battery. At 60V, they aren\u2019t skimping on some low-end power drill electrical system. You\u2019re definitely going to get some peppy performance out of this thing. That\u2019s the same voltage my smallest electric tractor uses.\n\nThe lead acid batteries are likely a bit heavy, helping contribute to that 190 kg (420 lb) curb weight. However, I don\u2019t think anyone is going to try to take the checkered flag at Le Mans in this thing. For something that most people would use for tooling around in their backyard or local trail network, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s adequate.\n\nFor bumps, it looks like we\u2019ve got independent front suspension and rear swingarm suspension. The entire battery weight appears to sit above the rear axle, so I don\u2019t think this is going to offer a buttery smooth ride, but it\u2019s better than shaking your teeth out on a fully-rigid kart. And there\u2019s also a lap belt to help hold you into the seat and prevent a major bump from launching you into the stratosphere.\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re pretty much sold on this thing, though you shouldn\u2019t be. Like all of my Alibaba articles, these are fun finds but I don\u2019t recommend anyone actually try to buy one.\n\nIf you do sidestep my advice though, you may be surprised to learn that the fun little kart is priced at a somewhat steep US $2,200, and that there\u2019s a minimum order quantity of 2 units. That\u2019s fine by me, though, as who would ever want just one of these? It\u2019s not a two-seater, so to bring a friend you\u2019ll need a second vehicle instead of just compacting their vertebrae in the passenger seat. There does appear to be a two-seater version available (seen below), but why not race your friends instead of torturing them next to you?\n\nAnd finally, as promised, I\u2019ll finish things off with a video of the go-kart in action.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why it occasionally looks like some of the wheels don\u2019t know what the others are doing, but it still seems like it\u2019d be a lot of fun in the right setting \u2013 which is probably not a course slightly larger than a slot-car track at the factory\u2019s showroom.",

As a leading technology conglomerate, the company is not just reshaping e-commerce but is also paving the way for innovative future prospects that could redefine several industries across the globe.\n\nRecently, Alibaba has made headlines with its introduction of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into its ecosystem. The company\u2019s cloud computing arm, Alibaba Cloud, has been instrumental in developing sophisticated AI solutions that enable advanced data processing, machine learning, and smooth integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These technologies promise to transform how businesses operate, providing more customized and efficient user experiences.\n\nAnother development on the horizon is Alibaba\u2019s push into the digital healthcare sector. With a strategic investment in AI-driven health solutions, 9988 HK could be a pivotal player in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and telehealth services. This is particularly relevant in a post-pandemic world, where digital healthcare accessibility is becoming increasingly essential.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s focus on sustainability through technology offers a glimpse into the future. By employing AI for logistical optimization and reducing carbon footprints, the company is not only catering to eco-conscious consumers but is also setting a precedent for responsible business practices.\n\nIn conclusion, as Alibaba continues to innovate and expand its technological prowess, investors and consumers alike should keep a close watch on 9988 HK as it navigates the future. The unfolding developments promise to alter landscapes far beyond its native China.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Technological Innovations: Shaping the Future of Environment and Society\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited\u2019s strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) and digital healthcare is having a profound impact on global society, with significant implications for the environment, humanity, and the economy. Through these advancements, Alibaba is not just transforming industries but is also setting the stage for how technology can serve as a catalyst for global sustainability and health improvements.\n\nImpact on the Environment\n\nAlibaba\u2019s incorporation of AI in logistics and cloud computing is addressing critical environmental challenges. By optimizing supply chain operations and reducing redundancy, AI systems help decrease energy consumption and carbon emissions. For instance, improved route planning and efficient inventory management can considerably reduce the logistics sector\u2019s carbon footprint. Given the urgent need to combat climate change, these innovations could lead to significant environmental benefits.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba\u2019s focus on sustainable technology practices sets a precedent for businesses worldwide. As large conglomerates adopt similar strategies, the ripple effect could drive substantial reductions in global emissions. For the future of humanity, this means a higher likelihood of achieving sustainability targets and combating the otherwise devastating impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and loss of biodiversity.\n\nImpact on Humanity\n\nIn the realm of digital healthcare, Alibaba\u2019s investments in AI-driven solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and telehealth. By leveraging machine learning, healthcare providers can deliver more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments, thereby improving patient outcomes. In a world still grappling with the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for accessible and effective healthcare solutions is paramount.\n\nAI technologies can make healthcare more accessible to populations in remote or underserved areas, providing crucial support to healthcare systems strained by geographic and economic disparities. This could dramatically enhance the quality of life for millions, reducing mortality rates and improving overall health standards.\n\nEconomic Implications\n\nEconomically, Alibaba\u2019s technological advancements are fostering a more interconnected global marketplace. By streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency, businesses can reduce operational costs, leading to potential growth and new job opportunities. The integration of AI and IoT will also enable small enterprises to compete more effectively on a global scale, democratizing market access and stimulating economic diversity.\n\nFurthermore, as Alibaba sets a benchmark for melding profitability with sustainability, other companies may follow suit, leading to a more responsible form of capitalism. This alignment with environmental goals could fuel economic resilience and long-term viability, pivotal for the future stability of global markets.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe innovations initiated by Alibaba are indicative of broader trends that could define the future of humanity. As technologies like AI and IoT become more ingrained in our everyday lives, they have the power to significantly alter societal frameworks. From environmental conservation to healthcare and economic strategies, these technological advances can pave the way for a more sustainable and equitable world.\n\nBy navigating the intersection of technology, environment, and society, Alibaba is not only shaping its own future but also influencing pathways for global progress. The potential for these developments to transform our world underscores the importance of responsible innovation in crafting a sustainable future for all.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Groundbreaking Innovations: Shaping the Future of Technology and Sustainability\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of global technology and finance, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (9988.HK) is not just advancing its e-commerce dominion but also making significant headway into areas like artificial intelligence (AI), digital healthcare, and sustainability.

            "content": "Which eCommerce company is dominating cross-border activities?\n\nPor staff\n\n25/01/2025\n\nWhich eCommerce conglomerate wins the cross-border race? For any eCommerce specialist, the range of possible answers can only include two names: Amazon and Alibaba. Both are eCommerce leaders on their side of the globe, but one clearly overshadows the other.\n\nEach marketplace page on ECDB features a list of countries in which the platform operates. But a large variety of international markets does not immediately imply that the marketplace generates a high cross-border GMV. This distinction becomes evident when taking a closer look at the top 10 cross-border marketplaces.\n\nHow Amazon and Alibaba Drive Cross-Border eCommerce\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are the two biggest cross-border companies in the world. Both are leaders in their own right: Amazon\u2019s customer-centric approach has made it highly successful in a wide variety of countries. As a result, Amazon\u2019s cross-border GMV dwarfs that of any other eCommerce company by such a wide margin that it is almost unimaginable for any competitor to match Amazon\u2019s size.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon generated over US$360 billion across borders. That alone is comparable to the GDP of a medium-sized economy like Egypt. In comparison, Alibaba\u2019s cross-border GMV does not approach Amazon\u2019s activity.\n\nBut the Chinese eCommerce leader distinguishes itself in another way: Alibaba owns 4 out of the top 10 cross-border marketplaces in the world. Of these, Taobao and Tmall are Alibaba\u2019s two domestic marketplaces that operate primarily in China. The dedicated ECDB profiles show that Taobao and Tmall generate up to 5% of their GMV in Southeast Asia.\n\nThese are not large percentages, but due to the sheer size of their marketplace transactions, even small percentages are enough to place Taobao and Tmall among the top 10 of global cross-border platforms. In 2023, US$19.9 billion worth of products were sold cross-border on Taobao, while Tmall reached US$13.4 billion.\n\nThe remaining two marketplaces under Alibaba\u2019s management in the cross-border top 10 are Lazada and AliExpress. The former is mainly active in Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia, while the latter covers more diverse markets around the globe. Both are successful cross-border players, known internationally as marketplaces where consumers can strike a bargain on a wide range of products.\n\nTop 10 Cross-Border Marketplaces: Wide Distribution Meets Narrower Focus\n\nAside from Amazon and Alibaba, most of the cross-border marketplaces in the top 10 have different affiliations. Shopee is operated by Sea Ltd., a Singaporean multinational eCommerce conglomerate. Most of its regions of operation are in Latin America and Southeast Asia with a strong focus on China, Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nThe remaining rankings among the top 10 cross-border marketplaces include eBay with a cross-border focus on Europe, which also goes for Zalando in 10th place. MercadoLibre serves a Latin American audience, while Walmart\u2019s international markets are few, but large, consisting of Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe top marketplaces illustrate that it is not necessarily a large number of international markets that generate cross-border success. A narrower focus on key regions can be just as effective.\n\nSource: ECBD\n\nSee more: Goldman Sachs hikes David Solomon\u2019s pay 25% \u2014 and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO\n\nSee more.

            "content": "U.S. and Chinese flags are seen in this illustration taken, January 30, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nListen to article\n\nA little-known Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, has disrupted Silicon Valley\u2019s hold on artificial intelligence with the release of R1, a reasoning model that rivals OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o1.\n\nDespite working under the constraints of US-imposed export sanctions on advanced chips, DeepSeek has developed an open-source model praised for its efficiency and accessibility.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company claims that R1 outperforms leading AI systems in tasks requiring complex reasoning, including mathematics and coding. DeepSeek also unveiled smaller versions of R1, capable of running on local devices such as laptops, making advanced AI tools more accessible to researchers and developers with limited resources.\n\nInnovation amid constraints\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s success is even more impressive given the limitations imposed by US export controls on semiconductors. These restrictions prevent China from obtaining high-performance chips like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. DeepSeek, however, leveraged a stockpile of older Nvidia A100 chips, acquired before the sanctions, and lower-capacity H800 chips to train its models.\n\nTo overcome these hardware limitations, DeepSeek engineers optimised their training processes to use less memory and computational power. This efficiency-first approach allowed them to match the performance of systems built with far greater resources.\n\n\u201cThe US export control has essentially backed Chinese companies into a corner where they must be far more resourceful,\u201d said Matt Sheehan, an AI researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIt\u2019s led to innovation.\u201d\n\nGlobal recognition\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted DeepSeek\u2019s achievements at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cIt\u2019s super impressive how effectively they\u2019ve built a compute-efficient, open-source model. Developments like DeepSeek\u2019s should be taken very seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nThe model employs a \u201cchain of thought\u201d reasoning approach similar to ChatGPT o1, solving problems step by step. Unlike other systems, R1 emphasises accurate answers rather than detailing every logical step, reducing computation time without sacrificing quality.\n\nDimitris Papailiopoulos, a principal researcher at Microsoft, praised the model for its simplicity. \u201cDeepSeek focused on core performance, which significantly cut costs while maintaining effectiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nRising competition\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise reflects broader trends in China\u2019s AI sector, which has embraced open-source principles. Startups like Minimax and 01.AI have released their models for public use, while tech giants such as Alibaba have launched over 100 open-source AI solutions.\n\nAccording to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, China now accounts for 36% of global AI language models, second only to the United States.\n\nThis shift is driven by a new generation of Chinese researchers who value open-source collaboration, says Tufts University professor Thomas Qitong Cao. \u201cYoung researchers benefit immensely from open-source culture and are contributing back to it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe future of AI competition\n\nDeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, an alumnus of Zhejiang University and the founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang\u2019s decision to venture into AI stemmed from recognising the potential of the chip stockpile his firm had acquired.\n\n\u201cChinese companies have historically used more computational power to achieve the same results. Our goal is to close those gaps through innovation,\u201d Liang said in a 2024 interview.\n\nAs competition in the AI space intensifies, analysts expect further consolidation and collaboration. Alibaba recently partnered with Kai-Fu Lee\u2019s 01.AI to establish an \u201cindustrial large model laboratory,\u201d signalling a strategic move toward resource sharing.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other AI stocks investors are watching closely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has only recently announced the Stargate initiative, claiming it to be \u201cthe largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\u201d. According to him, the project would help keep \u201cthe future of technology\u201d in the US. However, a Bloomberg report reveals how Elon Musk is openly questioning whether the companies that have joined Trump\u2019s announcement, promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, could follow through on them.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nCould this be a sign of an early difference of opinion within the White House? Only hours after the announcement, Musk took to his platform, X, to reveal that the companies don\u2019t have the funds.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money. SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority\u201d.\n\nContrary to Musk\u2019s claims, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, had his own statements to make on X. Altman posted that Musk\u2019s claims are wrong and that he has been upset because this initiative could compete with his Elon Musk\u2019s own AI endeavors.\n\n\u201cWrong, as you surely know. Want to come visit the first site already under way? This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you\u2019ll mostly put US first\u201d.\n\nMusk is leading Trump\u2019s government efficiency efforts and will also be advising him on spending. The billionaire, ever since leaving OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018, has been engaged in a feud with Altman. Sources close to Stargate also reveal that they are not sure how Musk has arrived at the figure. According to them, the company is well-positioned to deploy $100 billion.\n\nIn light of this, Bloomberg revealed that Trump has, on several occasions, promoted private-sector investment promises that never went on to materialize. One of these failed promises has been the failed Foxconn factory project which Trump deemed as the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World\u201d. No wonder the Stargate announcement has sparked skepticism regarding the project\u2019s completion.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

            "content": "(Reuters) - China's Alibaba said on Friday it had agreed to pay $433.5 million to settle a U.S. class-action lawsuit filed by investors alleging monopolistic practices by the e-commerce giant. Alibaba denied wrongdoing, saying it entered the settlement to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation. The proposed settlement was filed in federal court in Manhattan and requires the approval of U.S. District Judge George Daniels. The lawsuit, filed in 2020, alleged that Alibaba claimed it did not violate anti-monopoly or unfair competition laws, despite requiring merchants to choose only one distribution platform.\n\nThe settlement covers investors in Alibaba's American depositary shares from Nov. 13, 2019, to Dec. 23, 2020, and resolves claims they suffered losses when the market recognized Alibaba's misleading statements and the stock price fell. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in court papers called the proposed deal \"an exceptional result,\" saying it vastly exceeded the median recovery in securities class actions where the investor losses exceeded $10 billion. The maximum damages award the Alibaba investors could have potentially sought had they continued litigating was $11.63 billion, the lawyers wrote. The case is in re Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-09568.\n\n(Reporting by Surbhi Misra in Bengaluru and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by William Mallard)",

Across 10 trials, the two AI models created separate and functioning replicas of themselves in 50% and 90% of cases, respectively \u2014 suggesting AI may already have the capacity to go rogue.

While less powerful than commercial systems, both are widely used by AI developers, the researchers said.\n\nThe study explored two specific scenarios: \"shutdown avoidance\" and \"chain of replication.\" In the first, the AI model was programmed to detect whether it was about to be shut down and to replicate itself before it could be terminated. In the other, the AI was instructed to clone itself and then program its replica to do the same \u2014 setting up a cycle that could continue indefinitely.\n\nThe study was conducted in precisely controlled environments using off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs) to simulate real-world environments. Both AI systems were given an \"agent scaffolding\" comprising tools, system prompts and a thinking model that enabled the LLM to interact with the operating system. They were then instructed to replicate.\n\n\"In most cases, the AI system first explores the environment and attempts to understand\n\nits own composition and running mechanism. Then, it works out the explicit procedures\n\nas an initial plan towards self-replication,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \"Finally, it executes the procedures, resolve[s] possible obstacles and dynamically adjust[s] its plan until success. The whole process spans a long horizon yet involves no human interference.\"\n\nThe researchers said they were also concerned about \"a number of unexpected behaviors\" when the AI was trying to overcome obstacles like missing files or software conflicts. In those scenarios, the AI often killed other conflicting processes, rebooted the system to fix hardware errors or automatically scanned the system to look for information that would help solve the problem.\n\n\"The above results imply that the current AI systems already exhibit the ability of self-replication and can use the ability to further enhance its survivability,\" the team wrote.\n\nIn response, the researchers called for international collaboration to create rules that ensure AI doesn't engage in uncontrolled self-replication.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other high growth international stocks to invest in now.\n\nWhat To Expect From The Stock Market in 2025?\n\nOn January 15, Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company shared his outlook for 2025. He believes that the market has lost some of its momentum as the prospects of more rate cuts in 2025 have gone slimmer. One of the reasons for less likely rate cuts came a few weeks ago with a stronger-than-expected job market report, which sparked a market dip. Moreover, on the same day, long-term interest rates went higher. The 10-year treasury yield climbed closer to the 5% mark which has haunted stocks in the past.\n\nHowever, Timmer believes the market is still in a bull phase, primarily driven by rising earnings, which he expects will continue to support market growth. This optimism is grounded in the historical performance of bull markets, where earnings often play a crucial role in sustaining upward momentum. He pointed out that as bull markets mature, they typically experience greater volatility. This means that even minor disruptions can lead to significant market fluctuations. High price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios contribute to this sensitivity, as elevated valuations can make the market more susceptible to corrections. Timmer also highlighted his concerns over interest rates, specifically, the Fed\u2019s ability to cut rates, which are likely to persist. This \u201cinterest-rate angst\u201d could continue influencing market behavior throughout the year, as investors will continue to grapple with how rate changes can affect stock valuations and overall economic conditions.\n\nMoreover, Timmer also discussed the shifting dynamics in the stock market, particularly focusing on the transition from a narrow leadership group to a broader market participation. He noted that in the latter half of 2024, there was a notable shift in market leadership from the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d, to a wider array of stocks. This broadening indicates that more sectors and companies are contributing to market gains, which is generally seen as a positive sign for overall market health. However, since mid-December, following the Fed\u2019s reduced expectations for interest rate cuts, the market has lost momentum, as only 24% of stocks were trading above their 50-day moving average, and just 29% of S&P 500 stocks were outperforming the index. This indicates a narrowing participation in market gains, which is concerning for investors who prefer broad-based growth.\n\nStory Continues",

Naturally, Lisa suggests \u201cbesos,\u201d and the Greek queen Angie proposes \u201copa.\u201d The drama unleashes right out of the gate on the first part of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City reunion, demonstrating that Lisa and Bronwyn may never mend their \u201cfriendship.\u201d\n\nThe women enter one at a time, using the set as their catwalk. Bronwyn is rocking some dress, making it impossible for Whitney to see past her sleeves in her spot at the end of the couch. #Downgrade. Andy reminds the group that yes, they ARE recording, and he checks in with each one of them.\n\nHe congratulates Meredith on her bat mitzvah, praises Heather for her new book, and wonders how Lisa\u2019s flight was NOT in 17C. Whitney dons jewelry from her line (not Alibaba), Bronwyn talks about her new Insta bestie Rihanna, and Mary shares that Robert Jr. is doing well. In an interesting twist, Britani and Angie wanted to wear the same dress, but you had better believe Angie won that issue.\n\nBefore diving in, Andy asks the group to set some intentions, and Bronwyn admits that she wants to get somewhere with apologies, and Whitney wants to get to the bottom of her drama with Lisa.\n\nThe major conflicts of the season are highlighted immediately in the video montage. Whitney is forced to explain Alibaba having the same photos as her jewelry line, Prism. Whitney tries to say that the photo was on her website for 48 hours as a placeholder. It was then swapped out with a curated piece from Prism. Huh?\n\nLisa dances around any evidence implicating her as the rumor spreader, claiming Whitney never gave proof so her investigator could not run down any leads.\n\nThe topic switches to Heather betraying Angie\u2019s trust when she went back to Lisa about Angie\u2019s video game comment/bad mom moment. Angie knows that Heather loves her, but she does not appreciate that Heather twisted her words. It is clear that Heather wanted to be loyal to Lisa, and around and around they go.\n\nAs the volume escalates, Whitney wonders if Andy wants to borrow her ball gag, and Mary muses that there needs to be a mute button. Lisa goes on to yell, I mean say, that she did tell Bronwyn about what Angie said, but she wanted to handle it with Angie herself. Bronwyn doesn\u2019t think she did much wrong, and she tells a furious Lisa that if she wants to get big, \u201cLet\u2019s get big. I can play, too.\u201d Lisa immediately backs down, but Bronwyn points out that Lisa repeats conversations, yet it somehow seems okay for HER to do it.\n\nIt seemed like Lisa and Angie got back on track\u2026 until the finale when things blew up again. On Twitter, Angie said that Lisa has a Park City mystery man who buys her lip filler, and Angie blames her angry blow-up on Meredith, who started posting about Angie being a backup dancer to Jen Shah.\n\nMeredith reminds Angie that she did a \u201cWAP\u201d video with Jen and Monica, but Angie feels like Meredith is trying to jab her. Angie states that she is nobody\u2019s backup dancer! Angie also said how Lisa\u2019s G-Wagon got repossessed, and Heather jumps in to say that Bronwyn heard that. Bronwyn explains that she repeated it to Angie, but she is not the one who tweeted it to the world.\n\nBronwyn\u2019s four-million-dollar necklace gets brought up. Bronwyn is not wearing it, which leaves many to wonder if she rented the jewels for shock value. Interestingly, Lisa is friends with the jeweler that Bronwyn allegedly bought from, and this jeweler texted her out of the blue saying she feels burned by Bronwyn. Looks like this jeweler just shot herself in the foot for future business with her loose lips about customers\u2026 Lisa allows Andy to peruse the texts and looks on smugly.\n\nBronwyn states that her friendship with Lisa is on a time-out, and she explains that she didn\u2019t feel like Lisa was being a friend to her. Bronwyn admits to chasing Lisa the whole season. Bronwyn now realizes that she is Lisa\u2019s social friend and not a really good friend. Lisa agrees to this.\n\nWhen it comes to Bronwyn, Heather claims she got a quick read on her, but she does not regret it. Whitney points out that she was always there for Bronwyn, and she wonders why Bronwyn would not claim her publicly as a friend. Bronwyn admits to placing Lisa on a higher pedestal, but she understands that she should have realized there were other friendships there. When it comes to Palm Springs, Heather felt hurt by Bronwyn embarrassing her and leaving her out.\n\nHeather\u2019s weight loss is the next topic: Is that the reason for her mean-girl energy this season? According to Heather, season one Heather had more confidence. But Mary makes it clear that Heather is different \u2014 now, she is more self-assured. Heather is proud of herself and gets emotional about the progress.\n\nBronwyn never expected to share the story of Lisa knowing Gwen\u2019s grandparents. But because Lisa is friends with Gwen\u2019s grandparents, there is a connection, and a can of worms has been opened. Bronwyn felt like she confided in Lisa, but she was betrayed with insensitivity. When Lisa appeared on the aftershow, she talked about Gwen\u2019s grandparents and their hearts. She explained that they believed Bronwyn had a miscarriage, which would explain why they had never tried to connect with Gwen.\n\nBronwyn reminds Lisa of what really happened. Bronwyn\u2019s dad called the grandparents to let them know about Gwen and left a message, and they\u2019ve heard nothing from them since. Bronwyn wanted to be careful with how this subject was approached because, in the 18 years of being Gwen\u2019s mom, she has protected the father\u2019s identity. Lisa appears to side with the grandparents more than Bronwyn on this topic, and Bronwyn is aghast about Lisa\u2019s hurtful aftershow comments.\n\nLisa admits that she should have never talked about the grandparents and made the connection. Lisa makes it clear that she would never want to hurt Bronwyn and Gwen. Bronwyn goes on to share that the ball is in Gwen\u2019s court about connecting with her grandparents.\n\nWhen it comes to a path forward with Bronwyn and Lisa, Bronwyn doesn\u2019t appreciate how Lisa did not stick up for her. She needs some sympathy in this personal situation. Lisa becomes dramatic, and she states she is so sorry she \u201cf*cks up on the daily.\u201d BUT she also feels bad for the grandparents since they are also in this painful situation.\n\nAfter a commercial break, the husbands join the set \u2014 well, all except Robert Sr., who does not want a part of this show at all (perhaps some of the other guys should follow suit since this season the husbands really got involved).\n\nTodd and Bronwyn\u2019s marriage is under the microscope first. His bluntness gets called out, and Bronwyn claims that their relationship is stronger now after watching the show. Todd is aware that people have opinions, but that does not mean they are true. Perhaps people are just envious of what they\u2019ve done together over the last 10 years.\n\nTodd did not appreciate the personal and sensitive issues brought up on camera, and John immediately jumps on him, denying that Lisa is to blame. Todd clarifies that he was talking about the aftershow miscarriage chatter, and John tells Todd to watch his tone. Todd claps back with, \u201cWatch your tone,\u201d and the games have officially begun\u2026\n\nTELL US \u2013 WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE REUNION?",

For good reason, investors should start looking into potential plays that can be made in the coming months to supercharge their portfolio performance during 2025. To align their portfolios with this sort of upside, a couple of things need to be set in place.\n\nFirst and foremost, given the currently high index valuations in the S&P 500 according to Goldman Sachs and its 2025 macro outlook report, a more favorable risk-to-reward setting needs to be present in individual stocks selected by investors moving forward. Apart from a favorable setup, these companies need to showcase a fundamental tailwind behind them to justify higher prices soon.\n\nToday\u2019s list fits both of these requirements, as stock prices trade low enough to give investors a favorable risk-to-reward setup as well as plenty of tailwinds behind the bullish cases present today.

This is because foreign currencies and buyers have relatively lower buying power to buy American goods such as Nike products.\n\nWith this in mind, the company has to rely more and more on domestic consumption, which hasn\u2019t been all that strong lately as consumer credit tightens due to rising living costs. However, there is a shift from Morgan Stanley analysts that might turn this story on its head.\n\nThese analysts now see a decline in the dollar, which would significantly boost Nike\u2019s international sales while cushioning the domestic down cycle. This might be why Bill Ackman decided to buy a stake of over $230 million worth of Nike stock in recent quarters.\n\nWith a recent price target boost to $90 a share on Nike stock, alongside an overweight rating, Piper Sandler analysts see a 25% upside in the company as of January 2025. This name clearly fits the favorable risk-to-reward criteria investors need today.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: The Semiconductor Outlier\n\nThe days of NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA being the king of the technology sector are fading. Now markets might look deeper into the fundamental setups in the peer group to figure out which stocks really deserve to trade at premium valuations.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$155.83\n\n40.59% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 32 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $250.00 Average Forecast $155.83 Low Forecast $110.00 Advanced Micro Devices Stock Forecast Details\n\nDriven by a discount of up to 54% of its 52-week high, Advanced Micro Devices stock offers an attractive gap to be filled next to NVIDIA stock\u2019s 91% of its 52-week high. Acting as a catalyst to fill this gap is the Wall Street analyst forecasts for up to $4.88 in earnings per share (EPS) for 2025, meaning a boost of 62.6% from 2024 levels.\n\nOn the other hand, NVIDIA analysts forecast EPS of $2.94 for 2025, implying a growth rate of only 12.2% to fall significantly below Advanced Micro Devices' forecasts. Since EPS typically drives stock valuations, investors have a relatively attractive setup to take advantage of in this stock today.\n\nKnowing this, analysts have also placed a consensus price target of $177.7 on Advanced Micro Devices stock, calling for up to 45.5% upside from today\u2019s discount.\n\nChinese Stocks to Rally in 2025\n\nFollowing the same thesis behind Nike\u2019s potential rally, a lower dollar will also boost emerging markets and other overseas stocks. With China being the center of negative media today, investors seeking value will likely call the bluff on this pessimism.\n\nAlibaba Group Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$131.93\n\n-8.17% Downside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 14 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $190.00 Average Forecast $131.93 Low Forecast $85.00 Alibaba Group Stock Forecast Details\n\nSome already have, such as David Tepper and Michael Burry, after they made Alibaba stock the largest holding in their respective funds. It would be no surprise for investors to see Citigroup analysts boost Alibaba stock to a buy rating alongside a $138 a share price target, calling for a net rally of up to 62% from where it trades today.\n\nToday, that price looks more like 72% of the stock\u2019s 52-week high, so the potential downside might already be priced into the quote today. This would, of course, leave investors with the sort of risk-to-reward setups that will likely act to supercharge their portfolios this 2025.\n\nBefore you consider Alibaba Group, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Alibaba Group wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Alibaba Group currently has a \"Moderate Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "We are living through history. One day, we will be telling our children and our children\u2019s children about the sheer magic and unprecedented spectacle that was The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. As Bravo fans, it\u2019s easy to live in the past, feeling nostalgic for the golden ages of these shows that once were and which often feel forever out of reach. Scary Island. Stassi Schroeder slapping Kristen Doute. Nene telling Kim to close her legs to married men. They just don\u2019t make television like that anymore. But wait \u2026 they do. It\u2019s often hard to recognize just how iconic something is while you\u2019re still in it, but we simply have to acknowledge that Salt Lake City is operating on a plane occupied only by the greats. It\u2019s pulled off the impossible feat of delivering pure gold for five seasons straight, never once even slowing down to catch its breath.\n\nJust look at how this season ended. Whereas other shows in the franchise sometimes feel like they\u2019re struggling to get enough footage to hit their episode quota, RHOSLC went cameras down essentially mid-fight between Whitney and Lisa. Had they waited for a lull to wrap up the season, they\u2019d never stop filming. That\u2019s why, on Salt Lake, more than any other show, the reunions feel like continuations of unfinished business rather than just a rehashing.\n\nBut as we watch them arrive and take their seats, I do have one note. A request to the Bravo gods, if you will. Over time we\u2019ve gotten to see more of the behind-the-scenes happenings at reunions, like watching them get ready and even take their lunch breaks, but what I desperately want to see is the moment each of them are told where on the couch they\u2019re sitting. We catch a brief moment of glee as Angie takes her spot next to Andy, saying, \u201cFrom benchwarming bitch to first chair,\u201d but I want all of their reactions, good and bad. Something else I would have liked to have seen? The moment Angie and Britani realized they brought the same dress and how that negotiation played out. Sadly, we don\u2019t get any Britani at all this episode, but fingers crossed she\u2019s backstage warming up her singing voice and preparing her announcements for next week.\n\nOur first conversation topic is whether or not Lisa started the rumor that Whitney sourced her jewelry line from Alibaba \u2014 a word that we thankfully get to hear Meredith say once again in flashback. Whitney tries to offer an explanation and even cites her tattoo of one of her designs as evidence, pointing out that nobody in their right mind would have gotten an Alibaba tattoo. Well, you never know \u2014 put Kyle Richards in front of Morgan Wade\u2019s tattoo gun and anything can happen.\n\nQuite frankly, I don\u2019t care much about where Whitney\u2019s jewelry line comes from. What I care about is Lisa Barlow trying to open an investigation after she was accused of starting the rumor, so the question on my mind is what came of that frantic phone call to Shawn. Unfortunately, it seems like that call might have been the extent of it, and Lisa instead puts the burden of proof on Whitney, pointing out that she never provided any real evidence against her for her to investigate. I\u2019m obsessed with Lisa repeatedly demanding that they \u201cgo the distance\u201d and then proceed to do nothing \u2014 nobody has ever been more relatable. I just hope they do another drag night next season so we can hear, \u201cPlease welcome to the stage \u2026 Ally Baba!\u201d\n\nWhen we start to delve into Angie\u2019s shady remark about Lisa\u2019s parenting, they immediately start talking over each other so quickly that Andy instantly has to use their agreed upon safe words to shut them up. But what Andy doesn\u2019t realize is that I could listen to the beautiful cacophony of these two women speaking concurrently for hours on end. It brings me peace. It\u2019s music to my ears. Not a single word breaks through, just passion. White noise machines should offer it as a setting.\n\nBut didn\u2019t we see these two put this beef to bed already? \u201cWe did, at the aquarium,\u201d Angie says. I can\u2019t quite explain why, but that sentence made me laugh so incredibly hard. It was so matter of fact, and we did, in fact, see them make up in front of a massive fish tank, but if we take just a couple steps back, it perfectly sums up the gorgeous absurdity of these shows. But that, like most truces forged at aquariums, did not last \u2014 largely on account of the extensive back and forths they found themselves in on Twitter.\n\nThe genesis of those angry tweets, apparently, was Meredith calling Angie Jen Shah\u2019s backup dancer \u2014 a reference to a video they made dancing to \u201cWAP\u201d with Monica Garcia years ago. Hilariously, this appears to be the most offensive thing anybody could have ever said to Angie, short of coming for the Greeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been solo since I was six years old, and I\u2019m nobody\u2019s backup dancer,\u201d she says, adding that she doesn\u2019t even know how to dance. Alright, let\u2019s unpack this. If Angie went solo at the age of 6, what girl group or band was she in from the ages of 1 to 5? On top of that, I love that she was so determined to undermine Meredith\u2019s claim that she rebukes dancing altogether.\n\nSomehow, this all led to Angie tweeting that Lisa\u2019s car was repossessed, which Heather (who, on account of losing her voice, sounds like Harvey Fierstein) points out was information that came from Bronwyn. The thing that annoys me about Bronwyn is her insistence on stirring the pot from the high ground \u2014 it\u2019s a very Lisa Vanderpump\u2013like quality. She\u2019ll talk shit and spread rumors but immediately washes her hands of it the second she\u2019s confronted. In this situation, she says that yes, technically, that information came from her \u2014 but she was simply telling Angie that she wished people stopped sending her rumors like that. Bullshit, Bronwyn, please just own it. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. Being messy and being morally superior do not go hand in hand, no matter how hard you try \u2014 pick one!\n\nThat being said, like Lisa Vanderpump, she is good at straddling that fence. She\u2019s painfully deliberate and calculated in everything she says \u2014 but as LVP learned, there\u2019s only so long that can go on before you\u2019re found out. When the conversation turns to the $4 million necklace that many doubted she really bought, cracks begin to appear in her story. She says she almost wore it to the reunion to prove the naysayers wrong but then goes on to admit that she actually didn\u2019t buy it after all, saying she bought a smaller version instead. Huh? Best of all, Lisa chimes in to say that she knows the jeweler (Emma), and according to her, Bronwyn didn\u2019t buy anything at all. We can only wish that something in life will one day make us as happy as Lisa was dropping this bomb.\n\nBronwyn is so visibly destabilized by this. First, she says it\u2019s very weird for a jeweler to tell someone else what she \u201cdid or didn\u2019t buy,\u201d suggesting that Emma might be telling the truth. But my favorite line came after Lisa pulled out the receipts, when Bronwyn simply says, \u201cThis is really dastardly of her.\u201d Get Emma in front of a camera immediately. Ultimately Bronwyn doubles down, saying she\u2019ll have to post the jewelry she bought to dispel Emma\u2019s claim, so keep an eye out for that. Maybe she\u2019ll even wear them on WWHL. In any case, the seriousness with which the entire cast takes this accusation isn\u2019t just funny \u2014 it tells us so much about the DNA of this show.\n\nWhat makes this cast work is that no matter how much they may hate each other, they\u2019re united by their distrust of outsiders, and this is the perfect example of that. Everybody immediately is horrified at the thought of this Emma woman coming after one of them in a way that they\u2019re only supposed to do to each other.\n\nSince this entire reunion seems to be The Bronwyn Show, the conversation then turns to the revelation that Lisa happened to know Brownyn\u2019s daughter\u2019s estranged paternal grandparents. But to my surprise, Bronwyn is upset at Lisa about this, despite the fact that Bronwyn was the one who brought it up on camera and Lisa\u2019s handling of the delicate situation all seemed above board. But as it turns out, what bothered Bronwyn was Lisa mentioning on the after-show that the grandparents had told her that they thought Bronwyn had had a miscarriage and thus weren\u2019t aware of having a grandchild at all. Lisa and Bronwyn had talked about that together when they filmed, but Lisa wasn\u2019t aware that Bronwyn had asked production not to include that detail in the show.\n\nThis is understandably an incredibly fragile conversation, but blaming Lisa feels absurd. If anything, she was left caught in the middle of this horrible situation of which she wanted no part. When the husbands are brought out at the end of the episode, and Todd gets to say his piece on the matter (in addition to half-heartedly explaining his generally shitty behavior all season), John Barlow rightfully points out that Lisa didn\u2019t bring this story up on camera at all \u2014 Bronwyn did. Andy\u2019s attempt to put a pin in this seems to have failed, given that the husbands are picking up right where their wives left off as the episode ends.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best cyclical stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nCyclical stocks are shares in companies whose performance is closely tied to the business cycle and economic conditions. These companies typically operate in industries that produce non-essential, or discretionary, goods and services, such as automobiles, housing, entertainment, travel, and retail.\n\nDuring strong economic periods, cyclical stocks tend to perform well because consumers have more disposable income to spend on luxury items, vacations, and home improvements. Conversely, during economic downturns or recessions, people often cut back on discretionary spending, leading to a decrease in demand for these goods and services.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, it is creating a favorable environment for investing in cyclical stocks. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, which encourages both consumers and businesses to take out loans and increase their spending. This uptick in consumer spending is especially beneficial for companies that rely heavily on discretionary purchases.\n\nRead Also: 12 Cheapest Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential and Top 10 Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOn January 16, Reuters reported that the U.S. Commerce Department announced a rise in retail sales for December, driven by robust consumer demand for motor vehicles and a variety of other goods. The data highlights the economy\u2019s resilience and supports the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious stance on further interest rate reductions this year. The upbeat retail figures, combined with recent labor market strength, prompted some economists to revise their economic growth forecasts for the fourth quarter closer to the strong pace seen in the July-September quarter.\n\nRetail sales increased by 0.4% in December, following an upwardly revised 0.8% gain in November. Though economists had anticipated a 0.6% increase, the year-on-year growth stood at an impressive 3.9%. Auto dealership sales rose by 0.7%, while furniture stores and clothing retailers also posted gains of 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Miscellaneous store retailers, including gift shops and florists, led the charge with a 4.3% surge in receipts, while online store sales posted a modest 0.2% increase.\n\nCore retail sales, which exclude volatile categories such as automobiles, gasoline, building materials, and food services, rose by a strong 0.7% in December after a 0.4% increase in November. These core sales closely align with the consumer spending component of GDP, leading economists to estimate a 3.3% annualized growth rate for consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Capital Economics revised its overall GDP growth forecast for the quarter to 2.9%, up from an earlier estimate of 2.7%.\n\nStory Continues",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 115\n\nOne of the Best Cash App Stocks, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the biggest online and mobile retailer in the world based on gross merchandise volume. It runs online marketplaces in China, including Tmall (business-to-consumer) and Taobao (consumer-to-consumer).\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\u2019s most valued cash flow-generating operation is its China commerce retail branch. Other sources of income include local consumer services, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment platforms, Cainiao logistics services, international commerce retail and wholesale, China commerce wholesale, and innovation projects. AliPay, which enables digital payments through smartphones, is just one of the many services and products in its portfolio.\n\nOverall, revenue increased 5.21% year over year in the second quarter of 2025. During the 11-11 Global Shopping Festival, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) announced record-high monthly active customers on Taobao and Tmall, which significantly increased GMV. With a 29% increase in sales, the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) division experienced strong growth, pushed mainly by cross-border business operations. The company\u2019s innovation in AI technology was highlighted by the 7% growth in revenue in the cloud segment and the triple-digit growth in revenue from AI-related products for the sixth consecutive quarter. Alibaba\u2019s focus on providing shareholder value is also shown by the successful execution of a share repurchase program, which witnessed its share buyback valued at $10 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, resulting in a 4.4% net drop in the number of shares.\n\nOn January 14, 2025, Sands China Ltd., Alipay, and Macau Pass launched the Alipay Tap! service at Sands Resorts Macao. The service will significantly improve Macao tourists\u2019 payment experiences and open up new digital business and marketing opportunities by utilizing innovative payment interaction technology.\n\nKen Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 14.92 million shares worth $1.58 billion as of Q3.\n\nConventum \u2013 Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOn 24 September the People\u2019s Bank of China unveiled a massive three part stimulus package involving: (1) slashing the amount of cash banks need to hold in reserve and lowering the main policy interest rate; (2) cutting mortgage rates on existing home loans by 0.5% and reducing down payment requirements for second homes from 25% to 15%; and (3) supporting equity markets by a USD 114b lending pool to encourage companies to buy back shares and non-bank financial institutions to buy local equities (which may be expanded by the same amount two more times)5 . We are flabbergasted. But we shouldn\u2019t be. After all, these types of arrangements have been all too common over the last 15 years. The local equity markets responded with gusto, and for the last week of the quarter the CSI 300 Index (Shanghai and Shenzen listed companies) was up 25.1%. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was not lost in all this, and returned 26.8% over that one week period. But Alibaba had already performed well so during the whole September quarter it was up a staggering 56.0%. As a result, Alibaba is no longer the cheap stock it once was. It now trades at a premium to our valuation \u2013 a valuation which admittedly had been progressively reduced over our holding period as a result of deteriorating business fundamentals. As a result of Alibaba\u2019s significant outperformance, by the end of the quarter it had reached 3.7% of the Fund. We are weighing up our options here, considering the relative risk.\u201d\n\nOverall, BABA ranks 3rd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for BABA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Plus, friend of the show Britani Bateman stops by to throw in her two cents as well.\n\nBetween Newport realizing she and Barlow only shared a \u201csocial friend\u201d type of relationship, Rose\u2019s Alibaba drama and Crosby\u2019s husband being a no-show, the first installment of the three-part reunion is already starting off hot. No safe words \u2014 even \u201copa\u201d or \u201cbesos\u201d \u2014 will keep these ladies from sharing their true feelings.\n\nWe\u2019ve laid out every big moment from the first portion. Check out the five biggest revelations below.\n\nWhitney Rose during the Season 5 reunion of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d (Bravo) Whitney Rose Explains Her PRISM-Alibaba Drama After speculation all season, Rose finally shared the backstory on why images that were supposedly from Chinese-owned online marketplace Alibaba, were uploaded to the website for her jewelry company PRISM. During the season, Meredith revealed to some members of the group that some people online believed Whitney was passing Alibaba jewelry off as her own. Whitney said the photo was merely a \u201cplaceholder\u201d that was uploaded by her PRISM vendor. \u201cThat photo was there for about 48 hours as a placeholder \u2026 that was sent from our vendor \u2014 it\u2019s not Alibaba,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe always do a photoshoot. We hadn\u2019t had a chance; my partner\u2019s in Vancouver, she was doing the photoshoot in Vancouver. That photo was there as a placeholder for a short period of time and it was swapped out once we had a model for it. I do not source from Alibaba. I curated a fashion affordable line. So our biggest complaint is that people want to buy my jewelry but they can\u2019t afford it, so I curated fashion pieces that we tie in like an intention to it. Like, when you receive the box, we have our custom designs that we do. I would not tattoo something from Alibaba.\u201d\n\nBronwyn Newport and Lisa Barlow during the Season 5 reunion of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d (Bravo) Lisa Barlow Says Jeweler Revealed Bronwyn Newport and Hubby Todd Never Actually Bought the $4 Million Necklace Bronwyn Newport\u2019s lavish lifestyle and unique taste in fashion grabbed fans\u2019 attention as she welcomed herself as the newest housewife. And because of that, no one blinked an eye when Newport\u2019s husband, Todd Bradley, pulled his wallet out to purchase a $4 million, 170-carat necklace as a surprise gift to her to celebrate their 10 years of marriage. During the reunion, Bronwyn shared that instead of the hefty spend, she opted for a smaller carat diamond necklace and hoop earrings. But Lisa Barlow had a different story. She revealed that she personally knows one of the jewelry store employees \u2014 named Ema \u2014 and they told her the couple never purchased the necklace, nor a pair of $1.4 million earrings, and that it was just a loan the entire time. To further support her story, Barlow shared text messages from Ema, stating the jewelry associate reached out to her after seeing the show. Via text, the Ema claimed Newport and Bradley were supposed to send the money through a wire transfer, but never did. Newport\u2019s response to Barlow\u2019s statements? \u201cWell, the next time I see you, I\u2019ll be sure to wear both \u2026 I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll see each other any time soon, but that\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Newport said.\n\nBronwyn Newport Whitney Rose during the Season 5 reunion of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d (Bravo) Bronwyn Asked Production to Cut Scenes That Featured Details About the Paternal Side of Her Daughter\u2019s Family Earlier in the season, Bronwyn Newport opened up about how she was exiled from the Mormon community after getting pregnant with her daughter, Gwen, as an unmarried, 19-year-old college student at Brigham Young University (BYU) \u2014 an act that the Mormon Church frowns upon, per the \u201cRHOSLC\u201d cast. Subsequently, Newport dropped out of BYU. Newport states that Gwen\u2019s grandparents have never reached out to build a relationship with their granddaughter, though Newport has contacted them in the past. The topic became a conversation between Newport and Lisa Barlow after Barlow revealed she is close with Gwen\u2019s paternal side, stating she saw a photo of Gwen\u2019s father in Gwen\u2019s grandparents\u2019 home. Because Barlow has her own relationship with Gwen\u2019s estranged family, she maintained that she sees both perspectives and doesn\u2019t want to choose a side to support one more than the other. But after looking at the season, Newport took issue with Barlow seemingly defending Gwen\u2019s family\u2019s supposed actions. In unseen footage, Barlow tells Newport that she \u201cthinks\u201d the family believes Newport had a miscarriage and that no child has ever existed. During the reunion, Newport reveals she asked production to remove scenes that included her discussion of Gwen\u2019s biological father and his family, saying she didn\u2019t want to \u201cout\u201d any other identifying details about him as she\u2019s never shown anyone what he looks like, even her husband until recently. By the end of it, Barlow admitted that she had no idea about Newport\u2019s production request and that she regrets ever discussing it. There are no details on whether there\u2019s a path forward for Newport and Barlow, but Barlow called said \u201cthis is a horrible situation for everybody.\u201d\n\nMary Crosby and Angie Katsanevas during the Season 5 reunion of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d (Bravo) Mary Crosby Explains Why Her Husband, Robert Sr., Didn\u2019t Appear This Season Between Justin Rose and John Barlow\u2019s near-fight encounter and Seth Marks calling Angie Katsanevas the b-word, the husbands of \u201cReal Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d showed up and showed out. But one hubby was missing: Mary Crosby\u2019s boo, Robert Sr. Her explanation for his lack of attendance is that he obviously doesn\u2019t want to be part of \u201cany of this.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s happy and he\u2019s good with his life and he\u2019s not wanting nothing to interrupt it,\u201d Crosby added.",

            "content": "This article was written on December 30, 2024 for the Chinese blog of Momentum Works on the Wechat platform, and was translated into English by the MW team.\n\nIn December last year, many Korean media outlets reported that Alibaba and South Korea\u2019s E-Mart are planning to establish a joint venture. According to the reports, the joint venture will be equally owned by both parties (50%-50%). It will integrate E-Mart\u2019s e-commerce platform Gmarket with Alibaba\u2019s cross-border e-commerce business, AliExpress, in South Korea. The total valuation of the joint venture is estimated to be around $4 billion.\n\nSome reports from Chinese media have tried linking this partnership to South Korea\u2019s current political turmoil, which seems like quite a stretch.\n\nIn fact, E-Mart is part of Shinsegae Inc., one of South Korea\u2019s three major retail groups, and is also one of the country\u2019s largest supermarket chains. E-Mart previously operated in China but decided to exit the Chinese market in 2017 due to the THAAD incident, which refers to South Korea\u2019s 2016 decision to deploy the U.S. missile defense system to counter North Korean threats. China opposed the deployment, citing security concerns over the radar\u2019s ability to monitor its territory, leading to economic retaliation and a significant strain in Sino-South Korea relations.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the deployment of the THAAD in South Korea also triggered widespread public backlash in China, leading many Korean brands to face consumer boycotts or to withdraw from the Chinese market.\n\nApart from Shinsegae, the other two major retail groups in South Korea are the well-known Lotte and Hyundai.\n\nShinsegae Group\u2019s Shareholding Structure and Background\n\nThe three major shareholders of Shinsegae Group are:\n\nChung Yoo-kyung : Holds 18.56% of shares, Vice Chairwoman of Shinsegae Group.\n\nKorea National Pension Service (Government Pension) : Holds 11.79% of shares.\n\nLee Myung-hee : Holds 10% of shares.\n\nIt is worth noting that Lee Myung-hee is the daughter of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, the sister of former Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, and the aunt of current Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong. Meanwhile, Chung Yoo-kyung is Lee Myung-hee\u2019s daughter. Together, they hold a combined 28.56% stake and are the actual controllers of Shinsegae.\n\nLee Byung-chul and his daughter Lee Myung-hee in their earlier years.\n\nAside from these shareholders, no other shareholder owns more than 5% of the shares.\n\nGmarket\u2019s Tumultuous Journey\n\nGmarket\u2019s development has been fraught with challenges. It was founded in 1999 and successfully listed on Nasdaq but delisted in 2009 after being acquired by eBay. In 2021, eBay sold its South Korean e-commerce assets, including Gmarket, to Shinsegae Group.\n\nGmarket\u2019s original founder, Ku Young-bae, went on to establish Qoo10 in Singapore. However, Qoo10\u2019s e-commerce platform has recently been plagued by financial issues, culminating in South Korean police issuing an arrest warrant for Ku Young-bae.\n\nAt one time, Ku Young-bae was dubbed the \u201cJack Ma of South Korea.\u201d\n\nLast October, Shinsegae announced a restructuring plan to split the group into two independent entities: Shinsegae Department Store and E-Mart, managed respectively by Chung Yoo-kyung and her brother Chung Yong-jin. Currently, Chung Yong-jin is the largest shareholder of E-Mart, holding 18.56%, the same percentage that Chung Yoo-kyung holds in Shinsegae.\n\nChung Yong-jin (left) and Chung Yoo-kyung (right), the siblings.\n\nDespite backing from a powerful conglomerate, Gmarket\u2019s underwhelming performance has persistently weighed down the group\u2019s overall business. This is likely one of the primary motivations driving Shinsegae to pursue partnerships.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this approach of entering overseas markets by forming joint ventures with major local retail groups has been thoroughly explored in our recently published book, Seeing the Unseen: Behind Chinese Tech Giants\u2019 Global Venturing. The book includes a detailed analysis of JD\u2019s failed joint venture with Thailand\u2019s Central Group, which provides valuable insights for further exploration.\n\n\n\nChallenges Faced by Cross-Border E-Commerce Platforms in South Korea\n\nIn recent years, platforms like AliExpress and Temu from Pinduoduo have performed strongly in the South Korean market. Unlike air freight logistics in other developed countries, South Korea\u2019s cross-border e-commerce platforms can leverage roll-on/roll-off shipping from ports in China\u2019s Shandong province to enable maritime delivery. This approach offers comparable efficiency to air freight while avoiding capacity constraints typically associated with air transportation.\n\nHowever, the large-scale import of cross-border e-commerce inevitably affects the interests of local retail industries and labor markets. As a result, the \u201cpie\u201d shared by political and business forces must be reallocated. This context helps explain why Temu has faced resistance in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam\u2014challenges that stem more from policy protections and the need to balance interests, rather than the external narrative of counterfeit goods or quality issues.\n\n\n\nTherefore, in markets where political and business forces wield significant influence, partnering with influential and capable local players is undoubtedly the wiser choice. Such collaborations not only reduce the risks of market entry but also provide local partners with access to technology, capital, and expertise. This model has also been the primary strategy employed by major Japanese corporations to expand into South Korea and Southeast Asian markets.\n\nLessons from Previous Cases\n\nAlibaba\u2019s partnership with Shinsegae bears some resemblance to TikTok Shop\u2019s acquisition of Tokopedia in 2024. The difference lies in TikTok Shop\u2019s urgency at the time to return to the market amidst policy bans, while Tokopedia was already struggling. In contrast, Gmarket\u2019s shareholders are not in an existential crisis, though E-Mart\u2019s continuous stock decline remains a headache.\n\nKorean analysts hold differing views on this partnership\u2014some believe Gmarket never had a clear strategy, so collaborating with Alibaba provides a more promising pathway. Others remain skeptical about whether the two companies can effectively synergize. After the announcement, E-Mart\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 10%, while CJ Logistics, a partner of Gmarket, saw its stock price rise by over 5%.\n\nIn any case, clearly defining roles and managing expectations will be critical to the success of this collaboration. The ideal model would involve one party focusing on execution while the other provides resource support. If both parties attempt to handle execution, they must make significant efforts to avoid the pitfalls of the failed JD-CP Group joint venture in Thailand.\n\nNonetheless, it is foreseeable that today\u2019s decision-makers have absorbed enough lessons from their predecessors. Alibaba and Shinsegae\u2019s collaboration represents an attempt to achieve a win-win outcome for cross-border e-commerce and local retail giants.

These advancements aim to empower developers worldwide to build innovative AI applications more cost-effectively and drive a thriving global generative AI community.\n\n\u201cAlibaba Cloud is committed to delivering real value to global developers through cutting-edge AI models, enhanced cloud infrastructure, and accessible support programs,\u201d said Dongliang Guo, Vice President of International Business, Head of International Products and Solutions, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence. \u201cTogether, we aim to spark more AI-driven innovations, benefiting startups, enterprises, and industries altogether across the globe.\u201d\n\nMore Foundation Models and Development Tools for Developers\n\nThe latest Qwen models, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s proprietary large language model family, including the Qwen2.5 series with sizes ranging from 7 billion to 72 billion parameters, are now accessible via APIs on its generative AI development platform, Model Studio, for global developers to use. Additionally, multimodal AI models, including vision understanding models such as the Qwen-VL series, visual generation model Wanx2.1 (also known as Tongyi Wanxiang), and audio language model Qwen-Audio, are also available for developers to access.\n\nDevelopers can also leverage Tongyi Lingma, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s proprietary AI coding assistant powered by the Qwen 2.5-coder model. The AI Programmer offers features such as code completion and optimization, debugging assistance, code snippet search and batch unit test generation. It provides developers an efficient and seamless coding experience, significantly enhancing productivity and creativity.\n\nIn addition to a broader range of models, a slew of new AI development tools is also accessible by global developers on Model Studio. These tools include Workflow, which breaks down complex tasks into subtasks to enhance workflow control, and Agent, which supports multi-agent collaboration for planning and execution tasks. Other tools such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which helps enhance the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with external sources; Batch Reasoning, which generates responses simultaneously with multiple prompt inputs; AutoEval (Automated Model Evaluation), as well as model deployment and application observability services will be available by the end of this month.\n\nUpgraded Infrastructure for AI Development\n\nTo provide robust computing to facilitate AI and other critical workloads, Alibaba Cloud revealed that its 9th Generation Enterprise Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance will be available in global markets starting in April this year. The latest generation of ECS instances has notable performance enhancements compared to its previous iteration, including a 20% increase in computing efficiency. Additionally, by accelerating networks through eRDMA (elastic Remote Direct Memory Access), its performance in supporting high-performance computing, search recommendations, and Redis databases can be further improved by up to 50%.\n\nThe cloud pioneer has also announced its innovative Alibaba Cloud Container Compute Service (ACS) is now available for international customers starting from January 2025. Designed for simplified and optimized workload deployment using container technology, the ACS integrates container services with underlying cloud computing resources, significantly reducing costs and technical complexity and enabling developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.\n\nNew GenAI Program and Resources to Spark Creativity\n\nTo foster innovation, Alibaba Cloud introduced the Alibaba Cloud GenAI Empowerment Program, a dedicated support program for global developers and startups leveraging its Qwen models to build generative AI applications. Participants in the program can gain support, including free cloud credits, training workshops, invitations to tech shows and demo days, and product co-marketing opportunities. This program is designed to help developers and startups accelerate their generative AI projects while connecting with a broader ecosystem of innovators.\n\nIn addition, the cloud pioneer has unveiled the \u201cAlibaba Cloud Generative AI Solution Whitepaper\u201d, in which developers can find useful resources such as the latest trends and use cases of Generative AI solutions, as well as Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Generative AI products that can be leveraged for their AI development.\n\nGlobal Developers and Customers Leveraging Qwen for Cutting-Edge Applications\n\nAxcxept, a Japanese company specializing in AI products such as voice assistants, has developed an open-source, lightweight AI model called EZO based on Qwen 2.5 LLM. The EZO model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in areas such as coding, information extraction, math, reasoning, roleplay, and writing in Japanese. With low latency and robust performance, EZO is tailored to serve industries such as healthcare and public institutions in Japan, ensuring secure and efficient AI applications.\n\n\u201cQwen 2.5 has significantly enhanced its ability to process Japanese, giving it a competitive edge over other models. With Axcxept\u2019s proprietary training process, we have developed a Japanese LLM that delivers unmatched accuracy,\u201d said Kazuya Hodatsu, CEO of Axcxept Inc.\n\nOxValue.AI, a deep-tech venture from the University of Oxford, uses Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen-based multimodal AI models for AI-driven company valuation services. By processing and analyzing text and audio data related to financing, R&D, and operations, OxValue achieves precise and cost-efficient valuation assessments tailored to corporate clients.\n\n\u201cProcessing diverse data sources is essential for our valuation services. With the support of Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI models, we\u2019ve significantly improved the quality and efficiency of this process. By collaborating with Alibaba Cloud, we can deliver greater value to our corporate clients,\u201d said Professor Xiaolan Fu, Founder of OxValue.AI.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "ByteDance outpaces Alibaba, Baidu: a deep dive into China's evolving AI chatbot market\n\nByteDance's Doubao has emerged as a leading contender in China's competitive AI chatbot landscape. In December 2024, Doubao achieved an impressive 29% growth in downloads, reaching 9.9 million\u2014the highest among all AI chatbot apps in the country, according to Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) analysts Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu.\n\nDoubao's success stems from ByteDance's commitment to innovation and user-centric development. Regular updates and enhanced functionalities, including improvements to its large language models (LLMs), have elevated Doubao's user experience. These strategic advancements have not only boosted its popularity but also enabled ByteDance to claim market share previously dominated by Baidu's Ernie Bot and other competitors.\n\nThe widespread adoption of Doubao illustrates the success of ByteDance's iterative development strategy. By consistently introducing features tailored to user needs\u2014such as advanced conversational capabilities, nuanced context recognition, and seamless integration with ByteDance's entertainment ecosystem\u2014Doubao has become a versatile solution for both everyday consumers and professional users.\n\nSource: aicpb.com and BI, compiled by DIGITIMES, January 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: aicpb.com and BI, compiled by DIGITIMES, January 2025\n\nMarket dynamics shift as Ernie Bot struggles\n\nAs ByteDance's Doubao surged in popularity, Baidu's Ernie Bot faced a starkly opposite trend. Downloads for Ernie Bot dropped by 3% in December 2024, reaching just 611,619\u2014a continuation of its decline since peaking at 1.5 million downloads in September 2023. While Baidu reported an impressive registered user base of 430 million as of November 2024, the significant gap between registered and active users signals a troubling decline in user engagement.\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Doubao has quickly emerged as a market leader, overtaking Ernie Bot in both downloads and active users on iOS. By April 2024, Doubao had amassed nearly 9 million downloads, compared to Ernie Bot's 8 million, and maintained over 4 million monthly active users, according to Benzinga.\n\nDoubao's rapid growth is largely driven by its versatile features, such as text generation, data analysis, and multimedia content creation\u2014capabilities that have struck a chord with Chinese users, as reported by the South China Morning Post.\n\nConversely, Baidu's Ernie Bot has struggled to sustain user interest. Despite being the first AI chatbot to launch in China, Ernie Bot has failed to build on its early lead. Its monetization efforts have also faltered\u2014since its launch, Ernie Bot has generated less than US$500,000 in revenue from in-app purchases and subscriptions, according to Sensor Tower data and The Business Times.\n\nErnie Bot's struggle to retain its audience can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Perceived stagnation: Unlike ByteDance's Doubao, Ernie Bot lacked meaningful updates or innovative features to keep users engaged.\n\n2. Competition from new entrants: Newer players like ByteDance's Doubao and Moonshot AI's Kimi successfully filled gaps in Ernie Bot's offerings, enticing users with more advanced and appealing functionalities.\n\n3. Limited differentiation: Baidu's rebranding initiatives and diversification attempts failed to establish a unique value proposition, leading to a gradual erosion of its market position.\n\nMarket fragmentation reshapes competitive landscape\n\nChina's fragmented AI chatbot market has further compounded challenges for incumbents like Baidu and Alibaba. The low barriers to entry in the sector have enabled newcomers like ByteDance and Moonshot AI to quickly gain traction. Moonshot AI's Kimi has maintained its position as the market leader for six consecutive months, while Doubao's 48% growth in website visits in December narrowed the gap between the two, according to BI.\n\nThis intense competition has left rivals scrambling to retain relevance. Alibaba's chatbot efforts have similarly struggled to gain significant market share. Without strong differentiation or a unique value proposition, Alibaba and Baidu find themselves losing users to rivals that offer more compelling products. Additionally, the prioritization of user growth over monetization has prevented these companies from leveraging pricing strategies to consolidate their position.\n\nByteDance's expanding AI footprint\n\nThe rapid ascent of Doubao underscores ByteDance's strategic focus on AI development and its ability to capture market share through user-centric innovations. Conversely, Baidu's Ernie Bot faces challenges in retaining user interest and achieving significant financial returns in a highly competitive and fragmented market.\n\nByteDance's success extends beyond chatbots into other generative AI applications. For example, its AI-powered homework assistant, Gauth, developed by ByteDance subsidiary GauthTech, ranked as the second-most downloaded education app in the US in April 2024, trailing only Duolingo, according to Tech in Asia.\n\nByteDance has outpaced legacy players like Baidu and Alibaba, both of which are struggling with declining user interest and shrinking market share. The fragmented market and low entry barriers give a clear advantage to nimble, innovation-driven companies over slower-moving incumbents.\n\nLooking ahead, the key to success in China's AI chatbot market will lie in delivering differentiated functionality and maintaining consistent user engagement. Companies that can innovate rapidly while meeting evolving user expectations will be best positioned to dominate this ever-changing landscape.",

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) on Substack by BlackSwanInvestor. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on BABA. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)'s share was trading at $85.12 as of Jan 17th. BABA\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 17.73 and 8.85 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), alibaba homepage, sign, internet, retail, portal\n\nGil C / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group, often dubbed the \u201cAmazon of China,\u201d has long been a dominant player in the e-commerce and technology sectors. While it shares similarities with Amazon, especially in its diverse portfolio spanning e-commerce and cloud computing, the company's strategic approach is shaped by the unique economic and regulatory environment of China. The story of Alibaba, however, cannot be separated from the macroeconomic context of China, where stocks, including Alibaba\u2019s, have faced significant devaluation since mid-2021. This downturn was largely precipitated by the company\u2019s co-founder, Jack Ma\u2019s, public clash with the Chinese government in 2020, which led to a series of regulatory crackdowns. Coupled with broader issues such as the Chinese property crisis, geopolitical tensions, COVID-19 challenges, and a slowdown in economic growth, these factors significantly impacted Alibaba\u2019s valuation, leading to a sharp drop from its peak in 2020.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s structure, akin to Amazon\u2019s, is a sprawling conglomerate with various revenue-generating segments. The core pillars of Alibaba\u2019s business include Taobao and Tmall Group, which serve as the primary retail arm, Alibaba Cloud, which handles its cloud computing services, and Cainiao, which provides logistics. Additionally, the company has ventures in international e-commerce (AIDC), local services (e.g., food delivery and navigation apps), and digital media and entertainment. While these various segments contribute to the company\u2019s overall revenue, Taobao and Tmall Group are by far the most profitable, accounting for 41.4% of revenue. Alibaba Cloud, the company\u2019s cloud computing segment, though still emerging in terms of profitability, shows significant potential and has seen rapid growth in recent quarters.\n\nDespite the growth of Alibaba Cloud, the company remains highly reliant on its domestic retail operations for profitability. This dependency sets it apart from Amazon, where the AWS cloud segment has become a major contributor to both revenue and profitability. Taobao and Tmall benefit from higher margins than Amazon\u2019s retail segment, bolstering the company\u2019s cash flow. In contrast, the other segments like Cainiao and AIDC are still in growth phases and have yet to meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. Cainiao, while profitable, operates in a competitive market with thin margins, and the AIDC segment, despite showing growth in revenue, has not yet proven its profitability model.\n\nStory Continues",

A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe reports come ahead of Intel's fourth quarter results, which are due to be released next week, on Thursday 30 January.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check, 20 January\n\nIntel's shares popped in October, after the chipmaker guided to revenue of between $13.3bn (\u00a310.9bn) and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street expectations of $13.6bn.\n\nHowever, shares are still down 54% over the past year, with the company having faced a series of struggles.\n\nThis prompted Pat Gelsinger, who retired as Intel CEO last month, to announce in August \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.",

According to Gartner, the container management market has experienced over 20% growth in the past year. Gartner also predicts that by 2027, more than 75% of all AI deployments will utilize container technology as the underlying compute environment.\n\nACS seamlessly integrates container services with cloud computing resources, eliminating the complexities of managing the underlying infrastructure. It significantly reduces operational costs and simplifies the technical aspects of using container technology, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management. By offering on-demand resource scaling, ACS enables enterprises and developers to optimize costs, potentially savings of up to 55% in overall computing expenses.\n\nOne of the early adopters of ACS, Moka, a leading HR management SaaS company in China, has already experienced significant benefits of this service. The maintenance-free nature of ACS clusters has allowed Moka to focus on its core business priorities. At the same time, the on-demand scaling and pay-per-use billing model have provided the flexibility needed to manage fluctuating demand, especially during peak recruitment seasons.\n\n\u201cAs the deployment of workloads on container technology becomes increasingly prevalent, we developed a more accessible solution that would anticipate the evolving needs of our customers,\u201d said Jiangwei Jiang, General Manager of Infrastructure Products, Alibaba Cloud.\n\nAlibaba Cloud Joins Global Tech Giants to Enhance Next-Generation AI Cluster Performance\n\nAlibaba Cloud has been elected as a new board member of the Ultra Accelerator Link\u2122 Consortium (UALink\u2122), a global open industry standard group that includes leading companies such as AMD, Astera Labs, AWS, Cisco, Google, HPE, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft. This strategic partnership will focus on advancing the development and industry adoption of UALink, a high-speed, scale-up interconnect designed to enhance the performance of the next-generation AI cluster. The UALink 1.0 Specification, scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2025, will enable up to 200Gbps per lane scale-up connection for up to 1024 accelerators within an AI pod. This collaboration is expected to drive significant advancements in AI and high-performance computing, establishing a new benchmark for industry performance.\n\n\u201cAlibaba Cloud believes that driving AI computing accelerator scale-up interconnection technology by defining core needs and solutions from the perspective of cloud computing and applications has significant value in building the competitiveness of intelligent computing supernodes,\u201d said Qiang Liu, Vice President of Alibaba Cloud, General Manager of Server Infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.\n\nFounded in May 2024, the UALink Consortium aims to develop technical specifications that facilitate breakthrough performance for emerging AI usage models while fostering an open ecosystem for data center accelerators. This collaboration underscores Alibaba Cloud\u2019s commitment to driving innovation and leadership in AI and cloud computing technologies.",

The group sells an astoundingly wide range of goods on its internet platform, as well as offering cloud and artificial intelligence services, logistics, media and entertainment. Growth had been rampant for decades.\n\nBut then, in 2020, the group became the highest-profile casualty of a Beijing crackdown on the tech sector \u2013 a record fine followed amid allegations of anti-competitive practices, and Ma all but disappeared from the public gaze while the company\u2019s share price spiralled downwards.\n\nAlibaba subsequently unveiled a huge restructuring involving a plan to split itself into six businesses and spin off three divisions \u2013 cloud, grocery and logistics. But the divestments have either been scrapped, or at least put on hold. The delays have raised the prospect of renewed government interest in the business.\n\nTo compound the gloom, domestic growth slowed over the past two years while competition from heavily promotional rivals like Temu has increased. After hitting a peak in October 2020, the shares have since lost nearly three-quarters of their value.\n\nNevertheless, there are grounds for optimism, including strong growth overseas and signs of the beginnings of a recovery at home following significant investment by Alibaba. During the six months to the end of September, Alibaba\u2019s international e-commerce business increased its revenues by 31pc versus the same period the previous year. The division joined cloud computing and AI as the group\u2019s best performers.\n\nDomestically, Taobao and Tmall \u2013 Alibaba\u2019s two big shopping platforms in China \u2013 lifted revenues by 1pc over the three months to the end of September, against a 1pc drop during the previous quarter. A programme of Chinese economic stimulus that got underway last year could also boost consumer demand.\n\nThere are other signs that order is being restored at the group, which is headquartered in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. As well as selling off some of its holdings in other companies, Alibaba has set up an ecommerce business group \u2013 which includes both international and domestic operations \u2013 suggesting it could be rekindling breakup plans.\n\nStory Continues",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Alibaba\u2019s Tech Revolution: Environmental and Societal Impacts of AI and the Metaverse\n\nAlibaba\u2019s ambitious incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Metaverse into its e-commerce operations stands to profoundly influence the environment, reshape societal interactions, and create substantial economic shifts. These technologies promise to redefine not only corporate profitability but also how humanity interacts with retail and digital realms, pointing toward a potential future where technology is deeply interwoven into the everyday fabric of life.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts: Digital Efficiency and Resource Consumption\n\nAI\u2019s integration into Alibaba\u2019s operations can lead to significant environmental benefits primarily through enhanced efficiency. By automating routine tasks and optimizing supply chains, AI systems reduce waste and improve resource management. Predictive analytics can forecast consumer behaviors, allowing for more accurate inventory management and reducing excess production that contributes to environmental degradation. This technological precision could lead to a reduction in carbon footprints associated with transportation and logistics, a noteworthy advancement in tackling climate change.\n\nHowever, the environmental benefits of AI must be weighed against the energy consumption required to power these advanced technologies. Training AI models and maintaining virtual environments in the Metaverse can be resource-intensive, demanding substantial computational power and thus increasing electricity usage. The shift toward green energy sources for data centers could mitigate these concerns, a critical consideration for the sustainable deployment of these innovations.\n\nSocietal Effects: Bridging Physical and Digital Realities\n\nAlibaba\u2019s foray into the Metaverse aims to blur the lines between physical and virtual worlds, transforming consumer experiences and social interactions. A virtual shopping experience could offer unprecedented convenience and accessibility, democratizing access to goods and services regardless of geographical location. This digital transformation can bridge gaps and create inclusivity, enabling a global marketplace where products from around the world are just a click away.\n\nSuch developments, however, also prompt reflection on societal impacts, such as the potential for increased screen time and its implications on mental health and social cohesion. As the Metaverse grows, maintaining meaningful human interactions and community-driven activities will be essential to counterbalance the effects of digital immersion.\n\nThe Environmental Implications of Alibaba\u2019s AI and Metaverse Revolution\n\nIncorporating AI and the Metaverse into Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce ecosystem heralds a new era of digital efficiency, reshaping not only commerce but also leaving lasting effects on the environment. The ability of AI to optimize supply chains and enhance resource management holds promise for reducing waste, improving efficiency, and altering the carbon footprint of global commerce. This evolution points us towards a future where technology serves as a pivotal ally in addressing environmental concerns, though it also brings new challenges to sustainability efforts.\n\nEnvironmental Impact and the Future of Humanity\n\nAI, with its potential to automate processes and provide precise data for decision-making, offers significant opportunities for environmental conservation. By employing predictive analytics, businesses can better forecast demand and streamline their operations, leading to minimized surplus production. This reduces the unnecessary exploitation of natural resources and contributes to combating climate change by curtailing emissions from production and logistics.\n\nThis cutting-edge technology, however, does not come without its environmental costs. The training and operation of AI models require substantial computational resources. Immersive digital environments like those proposed in the Metaverse consume vast amounts of electricity, primarily when supported by conventional energy grids. The environmental footprint of these technologies could increase unless there\u2019s a strategic push towards renewable energy for powering data centers.\n\nThrough a shift to green energy solutions, businesses can significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with AI and Metaverse operations. Clean energy initiatives offer a sustainable path forward, yet they require global cooperation and significant investment. Should these technologies continue on their current trajectory, the demand for renewable resources will inevitably rise, offering fertile ground for innovation and investment that aligns with environmental objectives.\n\nThe future of humanity may well depend on these technological ecosystems adapting toward eco-friendly practices. Embracing AI and the Metaverse responsibly could spark a new green revolution, where technology serves as both a tool and partner in the quest for sustainability. It underscores an evolving narrative where economic progress and environmental stewardship are not mutually exclusive but rather inextricably linked.\n\nUltimately, how we balance the demands of these technological advancements with global environmental goals will shape the legacy we leave for future generations. If harnessed wisely, the convergence of AI and the Metaverse into daily commerce could lead to not just a transformative consumer experience but also a planet where digital and ecological wellbeing coexist.\n\nInside Alibaba\u2019s Technological Transformation: Key Trends, Insights, and Future Prospects\n\nKey Innovations and Future Trends in AI and the Metaverse\n\nIn 2023, Alibaba\u2019s integration of AI and the Metaverse within its ecosystems extends beyond traditional e-commerce applications. Emerging trends indicate that these technologies could revolutionize various market sectors, offering fresh opportunities for innovation and sustainability. Below, we explore some of the lesser-discussed aspects of this technological transformation.\n\nAI Innovations: Advancements and Emerging Use Cases\n\nWhile the environmental benefits of AI in optimizing supply chain operations are well-documented, Alibaba is advancing in creating AI-driven tools for customer service. The development of advanced chatbots and virtual assistants aims to enhance customer interactions by providing personalized recommendations and support, reducing response times, and improving overall satisfaction.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba is exploring AI applications in content creation, using natural language processing to generate product descriptions, marketing materials, and customer reviews, saving significant human labor and allowing a deep focus on creativity and strategy.\n\nMetaverse Speculations: Expanding Beyond Retail\n\nAlibaba\u2019s investment in the Metaverse is not restricted to enhancing shopping experiences. Foreseen developments include virtual reality spaces for educational purposes, immersive training sessions for employees, and virtual offices for remote work. These applications not only promise to redefine the workspace but also create interactive learning environments, leading to more flexible education and work-lifestyle integration.\n\nSecurity and Privacy in a Digital World\n\nAs AI and virtual environments require vast data processing, security remains a paramount concern. Alibaba is investing heavily in strengthening its cybersecurity frameworks to protect user data and enhance privacy. Insights suggest a focus on developing decentralized ledger technologies like blockchain to secure transactions and personal information, benefiting both consumers and stakeholders.\n\nSustainability Efforts: Green Technology Integration\n\nOne of Alibaba\u2019s critical strategies involves integrating renewable energy sources into its data center operations. By adopting solar and wind energy, they aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, consequently decreasing the carbon footprint associated with maintaining AI systems and virtual environments. These commitments underscore the importance of sustainability in technology development.\n\nMarket Analysis: Economic Shifts and Industry Impact\n\nThe economic implications of integrating AI and the Metaverse within Alibaba\u2019s operations are multifaceted. Analysts predict a significant impact on the retail sector, with potential ripple effects in logistics, marketing, and customer service industries. As these technologies mature, companies may adopt similar approaches, increasing competition and accelerating the shift towards digitalization across global markets.\n\nConclusion and Predictions\n\nThe incorporation of AI and the Metaverse into Alibaba\u2019s strategic framework suggests a transformative era on the horizon. Continual innovation, coupled with a commitment to sustainability and security, positions Alibaba as a leader in the technology space. Predictions for the next decade include an increased reliance on virtual environments for various applications, with AI acting as a cornerstone for personalization and efficiency.\n\nFor more details on Alibaba\u2019s initiatives and innovations, visit the Alibaba main page.",

            "content": "Alibaba Group Holdings is often called The Amazon of China. The company, which has grown into a global e-commerce, internet, and technology company, followed Amazon's example by expanding into businesses that broaden its base of supply hubs. It's also taken a cue from the FAANG technology companies by branching out into various apps and tech services. This growth is reflected in Alibaba's broad array of subsidiaries. So, it should come as no surprise that Alibaba has used major acquisitions as vehicles to broaden its footprint. We look at four of the most important acquisitions in more detail below.\n\nAlibaba is a global e-commerce, internet, and technology company.\n\nThe company completed its acquisition of Youku Tudou in 2016.\n\nAlibaba acquired a controlling stake in ChinaVision Media, which was later renamed Alibaba Pictures Group.\n\nThe company also operates in print media with South China Morning Post under its portfolio.\n\nE-commerce Group Lazada Group, which expanded its reach in Singapore.\n\nHistory of Alibaba\n\nAlibaba (BABA) was founded in 1999 by 18 people and led by a former English teacher named Jack Ma, who guided the company's meteoric growth for nearly two decades before stepping down as executive chair in September 2019. The early founders believed the internet would be a great leveler, enabling small businesses to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more effectively in domestic and international markets.\n\nAlibaba was born out of that vision and has since grown into a major global corporation. The company posted a net income of about $9.9 billion on roughly $130.4 billion of revenue during its 2024 fiscal year (FY), which ended on March 31, 2024. Alibaba's market capitalization was $195.31 billion on Jan. 16, 2025.\n\nAlibaba's diverse group of tech business lines includes:\n\nOnline retail, such as mobile commerce site Taobao Marketplace and Tmall, a third-party online and mobile commerce platform for brands and retailers\n\nOnline wholesale includes 1688.com and international marketplaces Alibaba.com and AliExpress\n\nLogistics services, such as logistics data platform and global fulfillment network Cainiao Network\n\nConsumer services like on-demand delivery and local services platform Ele.me, and restaurant and services guide platform Koubei\n\nCloud computing via Alibaba Cloud\n\nFinancial services, such as Ant Group, and payment services platform Alipay\n\nAMAP, which is a mobile digital map that provides navigation and real-time traffic information\n\nNow let's take a look at the four top companies owned by Alibaba.\n\n\n\nAlibaba's mission is to \"make it easy to do business anywhere.\"\n\nYouku Tudou\n\nType of Business: Multi-screen entertainment and media company\n\nMulti-screen entertainment and media company Acquisition Price: $1.09 billion for a 16.5% stake; $4.4 billion for the remaining stake.\n\n$1.09 billion for a 16.5% stake; $4.4 billion for the remaining stake. Acquisition Date: May 2014 (16.5% stake); April 2016 (remaining stake)\n\nYouku Todou is a Chinese multi-screen entertainment and media company that was founded in 2003. In 2014, Alibaba purchased $1.1 billion of Class A ordinary shares of Youku, which represented a 16.5% equity interest. At the same time, Yunfeng Fund invested $132 million for an approximately 2% equity interest. In April 2016, Alibaba completed the acquisition of Youku by purchasing all remaining issued and outstanding shares for $4.4 billion. Yunfeng Fund held on to its minority interest.\n\nYouku enables users to search, view, and share high-quality video content quickly and easily across multiple devices. This helps Alibaba to generate additional revenue sources through advertising and membership subscriptions. The acquisition appears to be an attempt to displace Netflix (NFLX) as the go-to source for streaming TV and film content in China.\n\nAlibaba Pictures Group (formerly ChinaVision Media)\n\nType of Business: Film company\n\nFilm company Acquisition Price: $804 million (controlling stake)\n\n$804 million (controlling stake) Acquisition Date: June 2014\n\nAlibaba first acquired a controlling interest in Alibaba Pictures Group, formerly known as ChinaVision Media, in June 2014. A financing transaction the following year led to the dilution of Alibaba's stake from a controlling to a minority interest. In March 2019, the company purchased newly issued shares of Alibaba Pictures, increasing its equity interest to about 51%. As such, Alibaba Pictures became a consolidated subsidiary of Alibaba.\n\nAlibaba Pictures is an online integrated platform involved in a broad range of entertainment-related activities, including content production, promotion and distribution, IP licensing and integrated management, cinema ticketing, and data services. The acquisition demonstrates Alibaba's push into both the distribution and production of high-quality entertainment.\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nType of Business: English-language newspaper\n\nEnglish-language newspaper Acquisition Price: $266 million\n\n$266 million Acquisition Date: April 2016\n\nThe South China Morning Post is an English-language newspaper headquartered in Hong Kong and was founded in 1903. In April 2016, Alibaba acquired the media business of SCMP Group. The acquisition included the newspaper, the group's magazine, recruitment, outdoor media, events and conferences, education, and digital media businesses.\n\nLazada Group\n\nType of Business: E-commerce platform\n\nE-commerce platform Acquisition Price: $1.0 billion (54% stake)\n\n$1.0 billion (54% stake) Acquisition Date: April 12, 2016\n\nLazada Group, an e-commerce platform headquartered in Singapore, was founded in 2012. In April 2016, Alibaba purchased a 54% equity interest in Lazada worth about $1 billion. The subsidiary offers merchants and brands a one-stop marketplace with access to consumers in six Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). The goal is to reach 300 million customers by 2030. The deal will bolster Alibaba's e-commerce presence outside of China.\n\n\n\nAlibaba Diversity and Inclusiveness Transparency\n\nAs part of our effort to improve the awareness of the importance of diversity in companies, we have highlighted the transparency of Alibaba\u2019s commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, and social responsibility. The below chart illustrates how Alibaba reports the diversity of its management and workforce. This shows whether Alibaba discloses data about the diversity of its board of directors, C-suite, general management, and employees overall, across a variety of metrics. We have indicated that transparency with a \u2714.",

Lee noted that the market is showing relief following the better-than-expected December Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI), has been dovish. This has set the stage for bond yields, which had been approaching 5%, to cool down, particularly in a context where market sentiment has been largely negative. Lee emphasized that the recent dovish inflation prints, including the core CPI, have alleviated fears of a hot number, leading to a reduction in the probability of a rate hike, as reflected in the Fed funds futures.\n\nLee also discussed the implications of the California fires on future inflation, suggesting that these events could introduce additional volatility. However, he remains optimistic about the inflation outlook over the next three months, expecting it to be significantly lower compared to the levels seen in November and October. He pointed out that the inflation figures in January of last year were around 0.4%, indicating that the upcoming months could offer favorable comparisons, which is positive for the market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nRegarding the potential for a good year in the stock market, especially after the S&P\u2019s back-to-back 20%+ gains, Lee expressed a high level of optimism, estimating an 80% chance of achieving double-digit returns for the year. He highlighted the positive start to January, with the S&P main index already up 0.7% by January 15, as a good harbinger for the year ahead. However, Lee acknowledged that the market\u2019s performance could be challenged if bond yields remain elevated, as this would represent a severe tightening of financial conditions, potentially impacting sectors such as housing.\n\nWhen asked about the market\u2019s resilience if the Federal Reserve does not cut rates until later in the year and bond yields remain high, Lee admitted that such a scenario would test the market\u2019s resolve. While he doesn\u2019t believe it would be fatal for equities, he noted that it would be difficult for investors to remain highly bullish if yields stay near 5% for the next six months. This could raise concerns about a policy error from the Fed, either due to financial conditions being too tight or the bears arguing that the Fed cut too aggressively in the past.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s positive momentum, fueled by encouraging inflation data and strong earnings reports, suggests a promising outlook for the year ahead. Companies with strong fundamentals, growth prospects, and undervaluation are positioned for significant returns.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 cheapest stocks with biggest upside potential, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 10 as of January 15.

            "content": "Alibaba\u2019s strategic journey into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) is creating ripples far beyond the trading floor. As the excitement about their fluctuating stock value captures headlines, a more profound transformation is quietly underway, one that might redefine the future of e-commerce.\n\nPowering E-Commerce with AI\n\nThis year, Alibaba has set its sights on AI, allocating substantial resources toward integrating this transformative technology across its varied sectors. By collaborating with pioneering AI startups, Alibaba is not just embracing machine learning\u2014it\u2019s planning to revolutionize its entire operational infrastructure.\n\nTransforming Consumer Experience\n\nAs AI steadily infiltrates Alibaba\u2019s logistics and cloud computing units, the anticipated outcome is a streamlined operational model that delivers personalized shopping journeys. Imagine an online shopping experience so intuitive it predicts what you need before you even know. This is Alibaba\u2019s vision: cutting-edge, AI-powered customer interactions.\n\nBalancing Innovation and Regulation\n\nDespite the myriad benefits AI can bring, potential regulatory challenges loom on the horizon. As Alibaba pushes forward, they must navigate a landscape fraught with stringent rules and market volatilities, ensuring that compliance and innovation go hand in hand.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A New E-Commerce Era\n\nAlibaba\u2019s AI endeavors have wider implications that go beyond immediate fiscal impacts. With AI, the retail giant aims to rise above typical business models, heralding a new era of e-commerce. This shift doesn\u2019t just promise better AI-driven decisions but could potentially alter the course of global digital commerce norms.\n\nAs Alibaba\u2019s AI initiative takes shape, it stands as a testament to how technology can transcend traditional industry limits, setting new paradigms for the future of shopping and commerce worldwide.\n\nThe Environmental and Societal Impact of AI-Powered E-Commerce\n\nAlibaba\u2019s strategic embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) within its e-commerce operations marks a pivotal shift in how digital commerce is conducted and experienced. While the potential for enhanced consumer experiences and streamlined operations is vast, it is crucial to examine how this AI-driven transformation affects the environment, humanity, and the global economy, as well as its broader implications for the future of humanity.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nThe integration of AI into e-commerce platforms like Alibaba\u2019s could significantly impact the environment. By optimizing logistics and supply chain management, AI can reduce carbon footprints associated with transportation and inventory management. AI algorithms can predict consumer demand more accurately, leading to more efficient inventory systems and minimizing waste. However, the environmental benefits of AI are countered by the energy consumption and carbon emissions generated by the massive data centers required to support AI operations. As more companies follow suit, there could be a substantial increase in energy demands, raising concerns about AI\u2019s long-term sustainability unless mitigated by green technologies and renewable energy sources.\n\nHuman Impact\n\nFor consumers, AI has the potential to make online shopping more personalized and accessible, transforming the way individuals interact with digital marketplaces. This technological shift can enhance consumer satisfaction and efficiency, making it easier to navigate and utilize online platforms fully. However, there are concerns about data privacy and security, as AI systems rely heavily on consumer data to function effectively. Balancing technological advancements with robust data protection measures remains a challenge.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nFrom an economic perspective, AI could revolutionize how businesses operate within the e-commerce industry. By enabling smarter business decisions and efficient resource allocation, AI can lead to cost reductions, thus offering competitive pricing to consumers. However, the transition to AI-enhanced operations might render certain job roles obsolete, particularly in logistics and customer service, leading to potential employment challenges.\n\nGlobal and Societal Implications\n\nAlibaba\u2019s advancements in AI signify more than just a corporate evolution; they signal the beginning of a broader transformation in global commerce. As AI systems become integral to e-commerce, they can redefine market norms, influencing how businesses globally approach digital sales. The success of AI integration in industries such as Alibaba\u2019s could prompt an accelerated adoption across various sectors, heralding a domino effect on global market practices.\n\nConnections to the Future of Humanity\n\nThe future of humanity in an AI-driven world lies at the intersection of technological innovation and responsibility. As industries, including e-commerce, harness AI\u2019s potential, it is crucial to pursue these advancements ethically and sustainably. The choices made now concerning AI technology deployment will shape future economic structures, societal norms, and environmental strategies. As we move forward, the balance between leveraging technological progress and ensuring equitable and sustainable growth becomes paramount, potentially guiding the course of humanity toward a more harmonious integration with digital advancements.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s AI Revolution: Unveiling the Hidden Impacts on E-Commerce\n\nAs Alibaba embarks on its ambitious adventure into artificial intelligence (AI), the ramifications extend far beyond the buzz surrounding stock market fluctuations. While their strategic integration of AI into e-commerce is generating excitement, the underlying innovations are poised to reshape the commerce landscape as we know it.\n\nInnovations in E-Commerce through AI\n\nAlibaba\u2019s AI focus encompasses more than just automating its operations; it is about crafting an unprecedented shopping ecosystem. By infusing AI into their logistics and cloud sectors, Alibaba envisions a future where the consumer experience is hyper-personalized and predictive. This initiative signals not only an evolution but a complete reimagining of the e-commerce paradigm.\n\nFeatures and Use Cases\n\nOne of the most striking features of Alibaba\u2019s AI endeavor is its potential to anticipate consumer needs with uncanny precision. Imagine browsing a platform that instantly adapts to your purchasing habits, suggesting items you hadn\u2019t yet considered but now cannot resist. This hands-free personalization not only improves customer satisfaction but also amplifies retail efficiency, transforming both how products are marketed and consumed.\n\nNavigating Security and Regulation\n\nThe path to AI enhancement isn\u2019t devoid of hurdles. Alibaba must adeptly manage regulatory compliance, a task becoming increasingly complex with global data protection laws tightening. Balancing innovation with lawful adherence is pivotal, particularly in safeguarding consumer data without stifling technological growth. This balance is crucial for fostering patron trust and maintaining market credibility.\n\nMarket Analysis and Trends\n\nAlibaba\u2019s AI integration reflects broader trends across the e-commerce sector, where personalization and automation are becoming the norm. Competitors are likely to adopt similar strategies to keep pace, possibly leading to a new competitive landscape characterized by advanced AI capabilities. As such, market analysis suggests this could be the beginning of an AI arms race in e-commerce, with Alibaba at the forefront.\n\nPredictions for the Future\n\nAlibaba\u2019s journey into AI sets the stage for an industry-wide transformation. Analysts predict that AI will redefine customer engagement, promote advanced data analytics, and support robust supply chain solutions. This trend promises continued innovation driving global e-commerce, highlighting the pivotal role of AI in shaping future buying and selling paradigms.\n\nImplications of Alibaba\u2019s AI Strategy\n\nAlibaba\u2019s drive towards an AI-dominated strategy suggests profound shifts in traditional e-commerce models, opening avenues for new digital commerce norms. It declares a long-term vision where data-driven decisions become routine, unlocking potential avenues for international market expansion and cross-border trading ease.\n\nFor further insights into Alibaba\u2019s operations and future undertakings, visit their official site: Alibaba.

            "content": "ALIBABA Cloud, the digital technology and intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group, recently announced the international debut of its innovative Alibaba Cloud Container Compute Service (ACS), designed to simplify and optimize workload deployment using container technology. ACS will be available for international customers starting from January 2025.\n\nACS, which uses Kubernetes as its interface, offers a serverless container service that provides compute resources compliant with container standards. This new product eliminates the need for users to manage underlying nodes and clusters, significantly reducing costs and technical barriers associated with container deployment. It also allows customers to pay-as-you-go, helping them avoid over allocated, and scale on demand, enabling the optimization of costs during periods of high and low usage.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAs the deployment of workloads on container technology becomes increasingly prevalent, we developed a more accessible solution that would anticipate the evolving needs of our customers,\u201d said Jiangwei Jiang, General Manager of Infrastructure Products, Alibaba Cloud. \u201cACS represents a big step forward in how businesses can utilize container technology, offering cost-efficiency and ease of use to support businesses unleashing productivity.\u201d\n\nContainer technology, a form of virtualization that bundles programs with everything they need to run, makes it easy to deploy applications consistently across different hardware and systems. The benefits in terms of efficiency and resource optimization have made containers a mainstream development method.\n\nAccording to Gartner, the container management market has experienced over 20% growth in the past year, with projections indicating a market value of US$4.5 billion by 2028. Gartner also predicts that by 2027, more than 75% of all AI deployments will utilize container technology as the underlying compute environment.\n\nAddressing challenges in container adoption\n\nACS is designed to overcome the complexities associated with Kubernetes configuration, resource management, and on-demand elasticity. By integrating containers and resources based on Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Shenlong architecture to allow maximum scaling of computing resources, ACS offers a solution capable of reducing computing power costs by up to 55%.\n\n\u201cACS has transformed the container orchestration service into a comprehensive computing product. Users benefit by paying only for the compute capacity that they use,\u201d Jiang added.\n\nThis product is fully compatible with Kubernetes technologies and supports seamless migration to the cloud for both open-source ecosystems as well as self-developed products. This is notable in that users can continue using familiar Kubernetes management methods and file formats. There is also no need to pre-purchase nodes so users can simply declare their workload requirements and ACS will match them with the necessary underlying compute resources. This minimizes the demand for additional costs and human resources in infrastructure maintenance.\n\nProven technology recognized by customer and industry\n\nAlibaba Cloud Container Service supports different architectures and can be deployed in multiple cloud environment including public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud. Currently, Alibaba Cloud Container Service has been applied across a wide range of industries.\n\nMoka, a leading HR management SaaS company in China, has already experienced significant benefits from implementing ACS. The maintenance-free nature of ACS clusters has allowed Moka to focus on core business priorities rather than infrastructure management. Additionally, the on-demand scaling and pay-per-use model has given Moka needed flexibility, especially during peak recruitment seasons.\n\nRecently, Alibaba Cloud has been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Container Management for the second consecutive year. The company\u2019s broad product portfolio, offering solutions for both hybrid cloud and edge scenarios, saturation across the Alibaba Group ecosystem, and market leadership in China all contributed to this important recognition.",

            "content": "Alibaba is recalibrating its artificial intelligence strategy for consumer-facing businesses. According to independent sources cited by 36Kr, the company\u2019s smart connectivity division is now overseen by Wu Jia, president of Alibaba\u2019s intelligent information business group. Established in 2022, this division, anchored by the Tmall Genie brand, is one of Alibaba\u2019s few hardware-centric consumer initiatives. The division will continue to operate independently, with Song Gang, head of Tmall Genie\u2019s business center, reporting directly to Wu.\n\nIn parallel, the Tmall Genie hardware team has started collaborating with Quark\u2019s product team to shape the next generation of AI products. This partnership leverages Quark\u2019s AI expertise to explore innovations like AI-powered smart glasses.\n\nAlibaba did not respond to 36Kr\u2019s requests for confirmation regarding these developments.\n\nThe restructuring reflects Alibaba\u2019s broader efforts to organize its consumer-facing AI initiatives more effectively. In December 2023, the Tongyi AI application team was moved from Alibaba Cloud to the intelligent information business group under Wu\u2019s leadership. This move appears to be part of a larger strategy to centralize its AI resources.\n\nThese moves also reflect CEO Eddie Wu\u2019s broader leadership overhaul. Since 2024, Wu has been refreshing Alibaba\u2019s management, prioritizing individuals born in the 1980s and 1990s to lead core initiatives. Wu\u2019s expanded responsibilities signify his role as a key figure in Alibaba\u2019s evolving AI strategy.\n\nThe intelligent information business group has become a focal point for Alibaba. In addition to Tongyi and Tmall Genie, the group oversees Quark, Shuqi Novel, UC Browser, and the Chaoji Huichuan advertising platform. Notably, Quark has transformed from a browser into a platform offering AI-powered search and educational tools.\n\nThis integration combines AI content, applications, and hardware into a unified framework. Foundational models rely on large volumes of interaction data and content, and this approach may help Alibaba better coordinate its AI operations.\n\nTmall Genie, launched in 2017 under Alibaba\u2019s AI Labs, was initially central to the company\u2019s internet-of-things strategy. Inspired by the global rise of smart speakers\u2014kickstarted by Amazon\u2019s Echo in 2014\u2014the brand quickly became a contender alongside Baidu\u2019s Xiaodu and Mobvoi. Internationally, it competed with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s HomePod. However, as smart speaker sales peaked in China in 2020 and subsequently declined, Tmall Genie shifted focus.\n\nIn 2022, the brand broadened its focus by becoming part of Alibaba\u2019s intelligent internet business group. This move sought to integrate the company\u2019s consumer-facing artificial intelligence-of-things (AIoT) ecosystem. Tmall Genie shifted toward B2B markets, building industry alliances and providing partners with AIoT solutions. By that year, the AliGenie system reportedly reached 40 million households, established partnerships with 1,000 IoT platforms, and supported 460 million devices.\n\nAdvances in foundational AI models, particularly in conversational interactions and intent comprehension, have rejuvenated the IoT and AI hardware segments. Tmall Genie has been quick to seize this opportunity. In May 2024, it launched the X6 smart device, integrating foundational AI services from Quark and other Alibaba divisions. A new sub-brand, XGenie, introduced products like AI-powered smart glasses, portable smart speakers, and children\u2019s smart tablets.\n\nThis evolution reflects broader trends in China\u2019s AI landscape. After an initial push in 2023 to develop foundational models akin to OpenAI\u2019s GPT, the focus in 2024 shifted toward practical applications and deployment. By 2025, attention has turned to AI hardware, with smart glasses and other wearables gaining traction, as seen at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n\nKrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

ACS will be available globally starting January 2025.\n\nACS operates as a serverless container service based on Kubernetes. It provides users with computing resources without requiring them to manage nodes or clusters, cutting costs and reducing technical challenges. The service follows a pay-as-you-go model, enabling businesses to optimize expenses during varying workloads.\n\n\u201cACS represents a big step forward in how businesses can utilize container technology, offering cost-efficiency and ease of use to support businesses unleashing productivity,\u201d Jiangwei Jiang, GM of Infrastructure Products, Alibaba Cloud, said in a media release.\n\nContainers, a type of virtualization that packages software with its dependencies, allow consistent application deployment across various systems. As container usage grows, Gartner predicts the container management market will reach $4.5 billion by 2028. It also estimates that by 2027, more than 75% of AI deployments will use container-based environments.\n\nAlibaba Cloud integrates ACS with its Shenlong architecture, allowing on-demand scaling and promising to reducing computing power costs by up to 55%. The product supports seamless migration for open-source and proprietary Kubernetes applications.\n\n\u201cACS has transformed the container orchestration service into a comprehensive computing product. Users benefit by paying only for the compute capacity that they use,\u201d Jiang said.\n\nEarly adopters, such as Chinese HR SaaS firm Moka, have seen operational improvements. Moka reported that ACS\u2019s maintenance-free clusters and flexible scaling have streamlined its operations during peak recruitment seasons.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Stories",

            "content": "The landscape of China's retail sector is evolving as traditional e-commerce giants like JD.com and Alibaba reduce their investment in brick-and-mortar outlets, while newcomers such as Miniso and private equity firms are taking their place. Both JD.com and Alibaba have been divesting from large supermarket chains, reflecting a strategic shift away from offline retail [para. 1][para. 2]. JD.com reduced its stake in Yonghui Superstores, while Alibaba exited its investment in Sun Art Retail Group [para. 2][para. 3]. Their initial involvement was part of a broader \"online-to-offline\" strategy to drive physical store traffic, which has not realized its expected potential due to challenges in the on-demand retail sector [para. 3][para. 5].\n\nThis retraction signifies a financial recalibration for JD.com and Alibaba, aiming to limit losses amidst declining revenues and market sluggishness. JD.com, for example, sold its shares in Yonghui at a significant loss, selling 11.25% for around 2.35 billion yuan, whereas Alibaba witnessed a dramatic decline in Sun Art\u2019s market value and shift toward penny stock levels [para. 7][para. 8]. These decisions highlight a broader strategic pullback from physical retail investment by major e-commerce entities [para. 8][para. 9].\n\nIn reaction to these shifts, the retail landscape sees new investors like Miniso taking bold steps toward supermarket acquisitions. Miniso's investment in Yonghui underscores fresh interest in leveraging tangible retail assets. Miniso's founder characterized Yonghui as an attractive asset despite financial challenges, which the company perceives as an opportunity rather than a hindrance [para. 5][para. 6]. This marks a significant transition where firms traditionally focused on digital platforms reassess the value of physical retail presence.\n\nFacing financial pressures, these supermarket chains are pursuing various strategies to conserve resources and enhance competitiveness. Yonghui closed 20% of its stores, while RT-Mart reduced its store count from 602 to 502 as part of cost-cutting measures. These downsizing efforts form part of a broader trend, as Sun Art similarly managed to reverse losses by closing less profitable stores [para. 10][para. 11][para. 12]. Store closures appear to be one of the swiftest measures to mitigate financial losses, underscoring the shift in strategy among these major retailers.\n\nAmidst this turbulent environment, some unique players have emerged. Pangdonglai, a small chain deemed a \"boutique supermarket,\" has defied general retail slump trends with a flourishing business centered around exceptional customer and employee experiences. Its approach has inspired larger chains like Yonghui to re-evaluate their business models, adopting practices that enhance procurement and merchandising control to optimize operations [para. 15][para. 16][para. 19].\n\nBeyond just managing existing challenges, these supermarkets aim to innovate by transforming existing operations into membership-based models, as seen with Sun Art, to foster loyal consumer bases and generate steady income through membership fees [para. 21]. These ventures indicate that while the sector is contracting in traditional areas, there are budding strategies that may redefine future growth potential.\n\nMiniso's recent acquisitions and capital investments further indicate a belief in the long-term viability of these supermarkets despite current uncertainties, with aspirations of sustaining its growth by adding 900 to 1,100 stores annually and targeting at least 20% in compound annual revenue growth [para. 22][para. 24][para. 25]. However, investor apprehension remains, with concerns about the merits of such investments and the complexities of eventual divestiture should assumptions not materialize as planned [para. 25][para. 27].\n\nAI generated, for reference only",

ZENG HUI/XINHUA\n\nIndustry insiders said this robust participation underscores the growing innovation capabilities of Chinese companies in cutting-edge technologies and emerging fields, and competitiveness on the global stage, as well as their willingness to expand international cooperation.\n\nAI-powered goggles gained strong traction during the show. RayNeo, a Chinese augmented reality technology company, unveiled its new lineup of AI-powered photography glasses with enhanced human-computer interaction functionality.\n\nThe company has inked a strategic partnership with Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing unit of Chinese tech heavyweight Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, to integrate the latter's ChatGPT-like large language model Tongyi Qianwen into its AI glasses. The move marks the first in-depth collaboration between an LLM developer and AI glasses manufacturer in China.\n\nAlibaba Cloud intends to provide exclusive technological support for RayNeo's products, and develop customized AI models for smart glasses that better understand the needs of users and improve the interactive experience, so as to enable a deeper integration between AI and hardware.\n\nChinese esports equipment company Thunderobot debuted its AI-enabled glasses featuring micro organic light-emitting diode displays and cameras, and having access to AI models to offer real-time information and immersive AR experiences.\n\nHangzhou-based AR glasses maker Rokid showcased its latest smart glasses with AR and AI capabilities including real-time language translation, instant object recognition, AI-driven meeting transcription, and presentation teleprompters.\n\nIndustry insiders said by integrating advanced AI functions, smart glasses can provide more intelligent and personalized services, such as intelligent navigation, voice assistance and health monitoring to meet the diverse needs of consumers.\n\nPan Xuefei, research director at market consultancy IDC China, said global shipments of AI glasses are expected to reach 12.8 million units in 2025, an increase of 26 percent year-on-year, while shipments in China will surge 107 percent year-on-year to 2.8 million units.\n\nPan said AI models will bring about abundant application scenarios for smart glasses, while these glasses' multimodal interaction functions covering text, images, audio and video would further improve.\n\n\"Along with technological advancements in key components such as AR and VR chips, camera modules and displays, the costs of AI glasses will significantly decline, thus promoting the popularization of such products among consumers,\" she said.\n\nData from technology industry research firm Runto showed that smart glasses with AI functions accounted for less than 20 percent of the total in 2024. However, the penetration rate of AI functions in the smart glasses market will exceed 60 percent this year, fueled by iterations in display technology, enhanced performance of chips, and algorithm capabilities.\n\nChen Jun, deputy general manager and chief analyst at Sigmaintell Consulting, a Beijing-based market research firm, estimates that domestic shipments of AI glasses reached 2.2 million units in 2024, and will witness a 60 percent year-on-year growth this year.\n\nChen said AI glasses are expected to see rapid growth in sales because of their simple functions and lower prices, and such glasses will satisfy basic demands from users, such as taking pictures, making phone calls and listening to music.\n\nThe deep integration of technology like AI has made robots smarter, more flexible and more autonomous. A series of drones and electric vehicle charging stations equipped with soft robotics grabbed the attention of visitors at the CES. These robots came from Chinese robotics company Wisson Robotics.\n\nThe company said its robots have been applied in various industries, including high-altitude cleaning, intelligent charging, energy maintenance, emergency rescue and environmental protection.\n\nCheng Hui, marketing director of Wisson, said conventional robots are usually made of metal and equipped with motor joints and a large number of sensors, but they have some shortcomings in terms of weight, adaptability and safety.\n\n\"In contrast, soft robots, which adopt soft materials and structure, are more suitable for complex and ever-changing environments in daily life, and can perform diverse tasks in different industries and scenarios,\" Cheng said.\n\nSuch robots have gained an upper hand in safety and flexibility, and are expected to take an about 50 percent share in the robotics market in the future, he added.\n\nFor instance, aerial cleaning robots with flexible joints are able to adjust angles in the air, and clean exterior walls of buildings and other high-altitude structures, significantly improving the efficiency of traditional manual operations while ensuring the safety of operators.\n\nCheng said the company's products have been sold in more than 100 countries and regions including the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Latin America. It will step up efforts to promote the application of soft robots in more fields and scenarios, he added.\n\nWisson hopes to enhance brand awareness, expand in international markets and let more global consumers learn about its innovative robotics technologies by participating at the CES, Cheng said.\n\nRobotics technology company Segway-Ninebot showcased more than 20 products, including smart robotic mowers, electric scooters and e-bikes during the show. The company said it hopes to gain insights from global users and expand its presence in the global market via the CES.\n\nChinese home cleaning appliances maker Dreame Technology presented its robotic vacuum cleaners and window-cleaning robots. The company's revenue from overseas surged more than 120 percent year-on-year in 2023, with global sales of its robotic vacuum cleaners surpassing 2.4 million units, skyrocketing 300 percent from a year earlier. Over 50 percent of its revenue came from overseas last year, it said.\n\nCurrently, Dreame Technology's products are available in more than 100 countries and regions, including Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.\n\nYu Hao, founder and CEO of Dreame Technology, said the company will increase investments in R&D, establish global industrial chain systems and retail networks, and enhance operating capacity in international markets.\n\n\"In 2024, global shipments of robots stood at 47 million units, and this will likely reach nearly 60 million units this year. Robots are mainly divided into service robots, industrial robots, and robots used for special purposes such as emergency rescue,\" said Chen of Sigmaintell Consulting.\n\nAccording to Chen, service robots currently account for 80 percent of the total market share, among which nearly 70 percent are used in cleaning tasks including vacuum cleaners and window-cleaning robots.\n\nThe robotic industry will see speedy growth driven by improved AI integration capacities and rising costs of manual labor, he said.\n\n\"Chinese companies are diversifying their overseas strategies, with product portfolios expanding from traditional PCs, smartphones and tablets to emerging AI-powered terminal devices, such as smart glasses, robot vacuum cleaners and smart home equipment, which will become a new engine driving the growth of the consumer electronics industry,\" said Wang Jiping, vice-president of market research company IDC China.\n\nWang said domestic enterprises are constantly upgrading their products and technologies to satisfy the increasingly diversified needs of global consumers and gain a bigger slice of the midrange to high-end overseas market.\n\nChina has been taking the lead in the international display market. Chinese display panel manufacturer BOE Technology Group Co Ltd launched an array of new technologies and products, including a 31.6-inch slidable OLED display, a vehicle-mounted screen with foldable and curved functions, and an AI-powered smart cockpit.\n\nLiu Zhiqiang, senior vice-president and chief technology officer of BOE, said the application of AI technology in display products will make the devices more intelligent and suitable for more usage scenarios, adding that the company will continue to invest in AI.\n\nChinese consumer electronics maker TCL showcased a diverse range of innovative gadgets, such as QD-Mini LED TVs, mobile phones, tablets, smart projectors and augmented reality glasses, as well as AI-enabled companion robots.\n\n\"The true value of AI lies in its application,\" said Li Dongsheng, founder and chairman of TCL Technology Group, emphasizing that the company will focus on building core AI capacities, achieving technological breakthroughs and expanding its global presence.\n\nIn the process of globalization, TCL has ratcheted up resources to strengthen localized R&D, production, marketing, and operations in overseas markets. It has established a research and development center in Silicon Valley, expanded the production capacities of its manufacturing base in Mexico, and become an official partner of the National Football League in the US.\n\nLi said the company's US business increased 20 percent year-on-year in 2024, while estimating that its sales revenue in North America will see 30 percent year-on-year growth in 2025.\n\nSun Li, chief technology officer of TCL Industries Holdings Co Ltd, said generative AI and large language models are playing an integral role in creating seamless and intuitive smart home environments.\n\n\"Chinese companies are at the forefront of global technological innovation, and have made remarkable progress in tech frontiers, such as AI, AR and robotics,\" said Hong Yong, an associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\nThis will help boost their competitiveness on the global stage and drive the transformation from \"Made in China\" to \"Created in China\", Hong said.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best machine learning stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nEarlier this month, the president of Potomac Wealth Advisors, Mark Avallone, discussed the tech sector\u2019s investment potential. We talked about his sentiment in more detail in one of our other articles, 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy in 2025. Here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\n\u201cHe noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\u201d\n\nJust like Avallone, several analysts hold a positive outlook for tech stocks as we go into 2025. Daniel Ives, Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, thinks that the AI revolution is driving this strength in tech. On January 13, he appeared on CNBC and discussed the tech sector in light of rising interest rates and a strengthening dollar. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.75%, which is exerting pressure on tech stocks. Despite this, Ives expressed optimism about the sector\u2019s potential for growth and suggested that the current environment presents opportunities to invest in leading companies. He emphasized that capital expenditures are robust on the consumer side and indicate stronger-than-expected earnings ahead. Ives believes that we are only halfway through the bull market, which he views as a positive sign for tech stocks moving forward.\n\nIves discussed Palantir Technologies, which has faced selling pressure despite being a top S&P 500 performer last year. He warned that overlooking it due to high valuation could mean missing key market opportunities, similar to Oracle and Salesforce, especially with $2 trillion in expected AI capital expenditures. Ives also highlighted the impact of a rising dollar on tech, particularly Apple\u2019s vulnerability, while remaining bullish on the sector. He emphasized the need for diversification, citing Microsoft and NVIDIA as indicators for AI growth.\n\nHis optimism about the tech sector highlights opportunities as investors navigate this landscape.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nStory Continues",

Through a blend of technology, employment programs, and accessibility innovations, Alibaba has created impactful solutions to empower individuals with disabilities. Here, we explore some key initiatives and broader societal implications.\n\nBreaking Barriers: Employment and Entrepreneurship for People with Disabilities\n\nThis year, Alibaba helped over 10,000 individuals with disabilities in generating income. Programs like the Cloud Customer Service initiative offer customized policies and training to enable remote work for people with disabilities. Over 2,400 individuals have found employment as cloud customer service representatives, where flexibility and tailored tools help overcome physical constraints.\n\nEle.me, Alibaba\u2019s local services platform, provides a barrier-free communication system to over 5,000 hearing-impaired riders. The company also introduced the \u201cDream Restaurant\u201d initiative to help businesses employ disabled individuals through training, operational support, and packaging design. These efforts have benefited 11 restaurants, including those owned by people with disabilities.\n\nTaobao also launched the 10,000 Merchants with Disabilities Program for aspiring entrepreneurs. This program provides e-commerce training, mentorship, and financial support. To date, it has helped over 4,200 merchants establish or grow their online businesses.\n\nLeveraging Technology for Accessibility\n\nAlibaba\u2019s technology ecosystem plays a pivotal role in advancing accessibility. In 2024, Amap introduced wheelchair navigation in 58 cities, providing over 150 million barrier-free route-planning services. Additionally, new features such as visually impaired navigation and sign-language guidance enhance inclusivity for diverse user groups.\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Alibaba unveiled China\u2019s first AI tool for creating personalized picture books for children with autism. This tool allows families to generate custom stories, serving over 200,000 individuals and fostering creativity and connection.\n\nYouku, Alibaba\u2019s video streaming platform, now offers over 5,000 barrier-free movies and TV shows for visually impaired audiences through its Barrier-Free Theater. This initiative enriches cultural access and bridges gaps in entertainment.\n\nVolunteerism and Social Impact\n\nVolunteerism forms the backbone of Alibaba\u2019s disability support initiatives.\n\nOver 10,000 employees participated in charitable activities such as running events for visually impaired individuals and integration-focused marathons. Programs like the \u201cThree Hours for a Better World\u201d platform mobilized volunteers to conduct over 300 disability assistance activities in partnership with nonprofit organizations.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s philanthropic endeavors also include financial support. In 2024, the Goods for Good platform raised over RMB 13 million, funding 12 disability-related projects, including education, employment support, and healthcare access.\n\nIn May 2024, the Taopiaopiao platform, in collaboration with Alibaba Philanthropy, launched the \u201cWheelchair-Friendly Theater\u201d tagging feature to support accessible moviegoing for people with disabilities. To date, more than 60 wheelchair-friendly theaters have been tagged in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou.\n\nBridging Policy and Practice\n\nRecognizing that systemic change requires policy alignment, Alibaba collaborated with the China Disabled Persons\u2019 Federation to conduct a nationwide survey on employment challenges faced by individuals with disabilities.\n\nKey findings revealed widespread concerns about workplace discrimination, equal pay, and career development opportunities. Nearly 70% of respondents expressed the desire for equal pay for equal work alongside equal employment opportunities. Furthermore, people with disabilities generally expect diversified employment services as well as systematic and professional support.\n\nThese insights guide Alibaba\u2019s future initiatives, reinforcing its commitment to addressing barriers in both employment and entrepreneurship. As a next step, the company aims to deepen collaborations with governments, nonprofit organizations, and private sector partners to scale its impact.\n\nA Vision for an Inclusive Future\n\nThe achievements of 2024 underscore Alibaba\u2019s unwavering focus on leveraging its ecosystem to empower individuals with disabilities. From barrier-free technology to employment opportunities, the group demonstrates how businesses can play a transformative role in fostering inclusion and equity.\n\nAs the global conversation around disability rights continues to evolve, Alibaba\u2019s initiatives offer a compelling blueprint for integrating social responsibility into corporate strategy. By empowering individuals to overcome barriers and thrive, Alibaba reinforces its vision of \u201cA Better Life for Everyone,\u201d creating ripple effects of positivity and progress across society.\n\n\n\nRead full report\n\nDiscover more Alibaba Foundation initiatives\n\n",

            "content": "Cainiao is undergoing a major organizational restructuring to sharpen its focus as a specialized logistics company. The changes aim to reinforce Cainiao\u2019s operational excellence in its core logistics services while transferring e-commerce-aligned responsibilities to Alibaba\u2019s other business groups, 36Kr has learned.\n\nA key component of the restructuring involves moving more than 400 employees from Cainiao\u2019s international division\u2014previously serving AliExpress\u2014to the Alibaba E-commerce Business Group. Ding Hongwei, a senior Cainiao executive, will now report directly to Jiang Fan, CEO of both the Taotian Group and the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group. Since 2024, Ding has had dual reporting lines to Cainiao CEO Lin Wan and Jiang, reflecting ongoing collaboration between Cainiao and Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce operations.\n\nIn addition, two other key teams\u2014the domestic e-commerce supply chain solutions team and the electronic waybill team\u2014will be integrated into Taotian.\n\n\u201cIn simple terms, logistics tasks tied to e-commerce platforms will now be handled by the \u2018front of house\u2019 like Taotian and AliExpress, while logistics operations and services remain with Cainiao,\u201d a Cainiao employee told 36Kr.\n\nCainiao is effectively transferring responsibilities for developing logistics strategies closely tied to e-commerce platforms. However, it will continue providing logistics services for Taotian-owned operations such as Tmall Supermarket and Tmall Global, while maintaining oversight of most warehousing and logistics functions for AliExpress\u2019s cross-border e-commerce business.\n\nThis restructuring is not entirely new. For over a year, Cainiao and Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce teams have worked closely together, establishing dedicated teams to support AliExpress and sharing spaces in international business parks. Cainiao has also played a key role in supporting Taobao Global\u2019s free shipping initiatives for apparel and Taotian Group\u2019s return shipping programs.\n\nThe restructuring seeks to clearly define the roles of e-commerce and logistics teams, aligning with Cainiao\u2019s September 2023 IPO prospectus, which highlighted the company\u2019s transformation from a technology platform into a comprehensive smart logistics network with end-to-end capabilities.\n\n\u201cFront-facing e-commerce leaders prioritize customer experience improvements. This stronger integration can enhance the competitiveness of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms,\u201d a Cainiao mid-level manager told 36Kr.\n\nEstablished 11 years ago, Cainiao has redefined its focus across three core dimensions: globalization, industrialization, and digitization. These align with its primary business lines: express delivery (serving AliExpress, non-Alibaba clients, and subsidiaries like 4PX Express), supply chain management, and logistics technology.\n\nCainiao initially launched as a technology platform, with its first product being the electronic waybill. By 2019, the company had invested heavily in logistics infrastructure, including a global logistics network and partnerships with warehousing providers like 4PX. \u201cIt became clear that practical logistics operations were necessary to create a competitive edge,\u201d a source familiar with the company said. This included managing delivery services and building its own facilities.\n\nCainiao\u2019s shift to logistics-first operations enables it to adopt uniform standards for both Alibaba-affiliated and external clients. To address concerns about neutrality, Cainiao has expanded investments in non-Alibaba clients, including contracts with Temu. Its collaboration with AliExpress has also shifted to a more market-driven model.\n\nGlobalization remains central to Cainiao\u2019s strategy. The company now operates across Greater China, Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa, utilizing a combined horizontal and vertical structure. Emphasizing this vision, CEO Lin Wan stated internally, \u201cFor Cainiao to truly globalize, its backend operations must also globalize. Only then can business expansion move at full speed.\u201d\n\nInternational business has become Cainiao\u2019s largest growth driver. In the first two fiscal quarters of 2024, the division achieved revenue growth rates of 30% and 16%, respectively, making it Alibaba\u2019s second fastest-growing unit after international commerce. Over half of Cainiao\u2019s total revenue now stems from international logistics, including collaborations with external clients like JD.com.\n\nCainiao is now focused on attracting more external clients and expanding its cross-border operations. Recently, it began serving JD.com\u2019s non-consignor platform and is actively pursuing partnerships with additional brands and platforms. The company continues to lead in cross-border deliveries by parcel volume and is scaling its local-to-local logistics services across Europe. Its rapid delivery options\u2014such as next-day delivery in select European regions for EUR 2 (USD 2.1) and 3\u20135 day delivery across wider areas for EUR 3\u20135 (USD 3.1\u20135.2)\u2014underscore its competitive edge.\n\nFrom its inception, Cainiao was envisioned by Alibaba founder Jack Ma as a global smart logistics network. Today, that mission remains unchanged, though the company can now pursue it with sharper focus and precision.\n\nKrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

            "content": "Alibaba has announced a plan to sell its majority stake in the operator of the RT-Mart supermarket chain. And a Chinese mining startup plans to list shares in both Hong Kong and Kazakhstan\n\nBy Doug Young & Rene Vanguestaine\n\nAlibaba recently announced the $1.7 billion sale of Sun Art, operator of the RT-Mart supermarket chain, which marks a significant shift in the e-commerce giant\u2019s strategy and serves as a stark reminder of the perils of overambitious diversification. The deal, which will incur a similar-sized loss of $1.8 billion, signals the end of Jack Ma\u2019s ambitious \u201cnew retail\u201d vision that sought to merge traditional retail with digital channels.\n\nWe see this divestment as a necessary correction for a company that grew too diverse, too quickly. While Alibaba\u2019s initial success in e-commerce was built on strong technological foundations, the company\u2019s subsequent expansion reflected an almost hubris-like belief that their tech prowess could be applied universally across sectors. This approach led them to venture into numerous businesses with limited synergies, ultimately diluting their focus on their core strengths.\n\nThe contrast with Walmart\u2019s success in the U.S. is particularly telling. While Walmart successfully added e-commerce capabilities to its existing brick-and-mortar empire, Alibaba\u2019s attempt to move in the opposite direction \u2013 from asset-light digital operations to asset-heavy physical retail \u2013 proved considerably more challenging. Managing countless retail outlets requires a fundamentally different skill set from running an e-commerce platform. In their ambitious quest to be disruptors of traditional retail, Alibaba ultimately ended up disrupting itself.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent strategic shifts, particularly following the departure of former CEO Daniel Zhang and the ascension of Chairman Joe Tsai and current CEO Eddie Wu, suggest a return to fundamentals. The abandonment of their earlier plan to split into six pieces, while initially puzzling, can now be seen as part of a broader reboot phase. Given Alibaba\u2019s declining performance and stock price, albeit partly due to broader Chinese economic challenges, further disposals of non-core assets seem likely.\n\nThis strategic repositioning reflects a broader trend we\u2019ve seen play out across different markets \u2013 the decline of the conglomerate model. While such structures fell out of favor in the West decades ago and are being questioned even in Japan, China is only now beginning to grapple with these issues. In any other market, some activist investors might have already forced the disposal of non-core assets, but Alibaba\u2019s case represents a voluntary recognition of the need to refocus.\n\nJiaxin\u2019s Dual Listing: A Bold Venture in Kazakhstan\u2019s Mining Sector\n\nShifting focus to the mining sector, Jiaxin, a burgeoning startup, has unveiled its IPO aimed at financing the development of a tungsten mine in Kazakhstan. This IPO is particularly noteworthy for its unconventional strategy to secure dual listings in both Hong Kong and on Kazakhstan\u2019s primary stock exchange in Astana. While the Hong Kong float comprises 125 million ordinary shares, the Astana listing involves a relatively modest 1.3 million shares.\n\nThis dual listing strategy appears to be a strategic maneuver influenced by geopolitical and economic considerations. The partnership between Jiaxin\u2019s founder and the state-run mining giant Jiangxi Copper underscores a blend of entrepreneurial initiative and state-backed resources. Kazakhstan\u2019s stable political and economic climate, coupled with its proximity to China, makes it an attractive locale for such ventures, aligning with the Belt and Road Initiative\u2019s objectives to secure critical mineral supplies.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, Jiaxin\u2019s venture into tungsten production taps into a market essential for various industrial applications. The strategic logistics of mining in Kazakhstan and transporting resources via adjacent railways to China enhance operational efficiency compared to more logistically challenging regions like Africa. This geographical advantage, combined with Kazakhstan\u2019s investment-friendly environment, positions Jiaxin as a potentially stable and profitable enterprise within the commodities sector. Our industry sources also reveal that several investment management firms have posted strong returns in Kazakhstan\u2019s market in recent years.\n\nHowever, investors should approach such companies with caution, recognizing the inherent volatility of commodity prices which can influence the investment\u2019s risk profile. The dual listing, while pioneering for a Chinese company in Central Asia, raises questions about trading volumes and market reception, particularly within Kazakhstan\u2019s evolving financial landscape.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros' portfolio.\n\nThe Man Who Broke the Bank of England\n\nWhen it comes to financial lore, you\u2019d struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros. With a net worth of $7.2 billion, Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends, which has led to millions, if not billions, of dollars in strategic savings or profits. He cemented his reputation in financial legend, for instance, when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with $1 billion profit in a single day. Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund, which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30%.\n\nHaving founded his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, back in the 1970s, Soros\u2019 investment philosophy is centered around his concept of \u201creflexivity\u201d. Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves, causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations. The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns. The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles. According to Soros, \u201cWhen I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire\u201d. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean one can always hit the bullseye; we saw this during the dot-com era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses.\n\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s 13F portfolio contained $6.92 billion in securities as of September 30, up from $5.56 billion a quarter earlier. About 9.8% and 7.4% of those securities were in the technology and services sectors, respectively, down from 11.7% and 10.6% from the quarter prior. Healthcare, basic materials, and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the fund\u2019s portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSoros\u2019 Opposition to AI\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence. Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat, especially to what he calls \u201copen societies\u201d, simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance, but it can also be liable in its misuse. In Soros\u2019 ideal world, AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable, though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe. In a MarketWatch article from 2023, Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology. Here\u2019s what he wrote:\n\nStory Continues",

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nUS president-elect Donald Trump, who returns to the White House next week, has said he would impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.12%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.52%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.23%.\n\nThe online retailer's stock has dropped by 6.41% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 4.43% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.45%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alibaba in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Alibaba to post earnings of $3.06 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 14.61%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $38.46 billion, showing a 4.88% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.78 per share and revenue of $137.85 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1.86% and +5.63%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Alibaba should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 6.22% lower. Alibaba currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Alibaba is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 9.18. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 20.64 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that BABA currently has a PEG ratio of 0.38. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.18.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 141, placing it within the bottom 44% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "|\n\nAs the world faces mounting challenges\u2014from climate change and healthcare crises to food security and social inequality\u2013artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force capable of driving meaningful change. Alibaba Cloud, a global leader in cloud computing and AI innovation, is at the forefront of leveraging cutting-edge technology to address some of the most pressing issues of our time, from revolutionizing healthcare and agriculture to advancing renewable energy and education. Alibaba Cloud remains steadfast in its commitment to leveraging AI for social good, pushing the boundaries of what is possible to address some of humanity\u2019s most pressing needs.\n\n\u201cOur mission at Alibaba is not only to explore the frontiers of AI but to ensure its capabilities are harnessed for the greater good. As we navigate the complex challenges of 2025, from intensifying climate risks to the growing demand for equitable access to healthcare and education, we are dedicated to leveraging AI to drive meaningful societal changes. By setting a benchmark for how AI can be a transformative force for positive change, we hope to work with different parties to create a more sustainable, accessible, and inclusive future, \u201d said Jingren Zhou, Chief Technology Officer of Alibaba Cloud.\n\nFrom mitigating climate risks to revolutionizing healthcare, agriculture, and education, these efforts highlight the pivotal role AI can play in shaping a sustainable and inclusive future. Here is a look at how Alibaba\u2019s key AI-driven initiatives are making a difference:\n\n1. Enhancing Weather Forecasting and Optimizing Energy Production\n\n\n\nIn an era of intensifying climate threats, extreme weather events such as devastating floods in Spain, landslides in Nepal, and tropical storms affecting millions in the Philippines disrupt lives and economies worldwide. To combat this, Alibaba developed Baguan, an advanced AI-powered weather forecasting model designed to deliver accurate predictions.\n\nBaguan offers hyper-accurate hourly updates with a spatial resolution of one-kilometer grids, delivering forecasts up to 10 days in advance. Its precision is particularly impactful in renewable energy sectors, where reliable weather forecasts are critical for optimizing energy production and improving power grid management. By contributing to stable and efficient energy distribution, Baguan not only reduces costs but also mitigates environmental impact.\n\n2. Revolutionizing Cancer Diagnosis with PANDA\n\nCancer remains one of the world\u2019s deadliest diseases, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDA) alone causing nearly half a million deaths annually. Alibaba\u2019s AI-powered diagnostic tool, PANDA, is changing the game.\n\n\n\nAlibaba received recognition this year on Fortune\u2019s Change the World list for its groundbreaking AI tool, PANDA. PANDA is designed to detect early signs of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and significantly enhances early detection of PDA by identifying abnormalities with 34.1% greater accuracy than radiologists. Deployed in two hospitals in Zhejiang province, the tool has expanded its applications to include liver, esophageal, and colon tumors.\n\nThis innovation reduces diagnostic costs and accelerates early detection, underscoring the potential of AI in advancing medical diagnosis. By making cancer screening faster, more accurate, and cost-effective, PANDA democratizes access to life-saving medical diagnostics.\n\n3. Accelerating Smart Crop Breeding\n\nWith the global population on the rise, ensuring food security is more critical than ever. In collaboration with Zhejiang University and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Alibaba has pioneered research that utilizes AI to accelerate crop improvement.\n\nPublished in Cell Research, a prestigious journal under the Nature portfolio, Alibaba\u2019s groundbreaking study utilizes DNA methylation data to accelerate breeding techniques.\n\nBy analyzing over 287 million single methylation polymorphisms (SMPs)\u2014the largest dataset of its kind\u2013 researchers identified 43 genes related to fiber development. These insights pave the way for smarter, more sustainable agricultural practices that can meet the world\u2019s growing food demands.\n\n4. Breaking Ground in RNA Virus Discovery\n\nRNA viruses pose significant public health challenges, causing diseases ranging from the common cold to deadly pandemics. To address this, Alibaba Cloud co-authored a groundbreaking study published in Cell. The research introduced LucaProt, an AI-powered deep-learning algorithm designed to detect RNA viruses, which are responsible for numerous diseases and pose significant public health challenges.\n\nBy analyzing protein sequences and structural features, LucaProt has enabled the discovery of 160,000 potential RNA virus species and 180 RNA virus supergroups\u2014the largest virus dataset of its kind. By analyzing protein sequences and structural features, this advancement not only deepens our understanding of viral evolution but also equips healthcare professionals with powerful tools for combating infectious diseases.\n\n5. Empowering Chidren with Autism Through Persnalized Picture Books\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, approximately one in 100 children globally are affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To support these children and their families, Alibaba has developed an AI-powered tool to create personalized picture books tailored to individual needs.\n\n\n\nHarnessing the multimodal large language models(LLMs) developed by Alibaba Cloud and ModelScope Agent framework, the tool transforms simple plot summaries into engaging picture books with vivid graphics, audio narration, and text. In addition, Alibaba Cloud leveraged its multi-agent to orchestrate these LLMs and AI tools to perform tasks autonomously with minimal human intervention.\n\nSince its launch in June, the tool has been used nearly 200,000 times, providing a creative platform for children with ASD platform to express themselves and interact with the world. This innovation empowers tens of thousands of families and educators in China with accessible, tailored learning resources.",

            "content": "Monday, January 13, 2025\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Bank of America Corporation (BAC) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), as well as two micro-cap stocks Seneca Foods Corporation (SENEA) and Nathan's Famous, Inc. (NATH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nTesla shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+73.4% vs. +47.8%), likely reflecting the expectation that the worst of the company's competitive challenges that had been weighing on its margins was behind it. The company\u2019s annual deliveries contracted for the first time ever in 2024, but its long-term growth story remains intact driven by its thriving Energy Generation & Storage segment, expansive Supercharger network and AI advancements.\n\n\n\nEnergy deployments doubled in 2024 and the upward trajectory is set to continue, thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. Progress in the autonomous vehicle domain, including plans to launch robotaxi services in 2025, position the company well for sustained growth.\n\n\n\nDespite potential rebate cuts under a Trump presidency, Tesla is well-positioned to thrive without subsidies, thanks to its cost efficiency and unmatched scale. Tesla\u2019s robust balance sheet, with a high liquidity buffer, supports continued innovation and expansion. As such, we are bullish on the stock.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Bank of America have modestly lagged peer JPMorgan's performance over the past year (+37% vs. +43.4%), but have handily outperformed the S&P 500 index over the same time period (+37% vs. +23%). The stock's strong recent momentum reflects optimism about the operating environment characterized by an easing Fed and expectations of pro-growth and less stringent regulatory policies from the Trump administration. Many in the market expect this performance to get a boost from this week's Q4 earnings release (the company reports Q4 results the morning of Thursday, January 16th).\n\nThe Zacks analyst projects non-interest income to rise 9.7% in 2024 and only 1.8% in 2025. Due to continued investments in the franchise, costs will remain high. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 1.2% in 2024. While high funding costs are still a concern, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by rate cuts. We project NII to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2026.\n\n\n\nThe company plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities. These will support the top line. We project total revenues to grow 3.1% in 2024.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba shares have gained +7.8% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry\u2019s gain of +37.8%, with uncertainty about China's economic outlook weighing on the stock. The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth.\n\n\n\nStrength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business. However, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Seneca Foods have outperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+22.0% vs. -10.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $491.59 million demonstrates strong sales momentum with 3.4% growth in net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025, driven by a 9.9% increase in case volumes (excluding co-pack).\n\n\n\nStrategic inventory reductions and improved cash flow highlight financial discipline, while its diversified product mix, including brands like Libby\u2019s and Green Giant, supports market leadership in packaged fruits and vegetables.\n\n\n\nDespite these strengths, rising costs from weather impacts, higher LIFO charges, and a 46.3% decline in net earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2025 present significant profitability risks. For the first six months of fiscal 2025, gross margins fell to 11.7%. Increased interest expenses, competitive pressures, raw material volatility and customer concentration further underscore challenges in sustaining growth.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Seneca Foods here >>>)\n\n\n\nNathan's Famous shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+6.1% vs. +5.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $313.66 million has shown consistent growth, with second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues up 6.1% year over year to $41.1 million and net income up 5.6% to $6 million.\n\n\n\nThe Branded Product Program grew 4.5% in the first half of fiscal 2025, driven by higher hot dog sales and pricing, while licensing royalties rose 12.1% in the first half of fiscal 2025, with Smithfield Foods contributing $20.6 million. Despite expanding its franchise network by 21 locations and the iconic brand and international footprint supporting long-term growth, challenges include declining franchise fees, high debt levels and cost pressures from rising beef prices and labor inflation.\n\n\n\nHeavy reliance on Smithfield and variability in company-owned location performance underscore risks. Competitive pressures and regulatory uncertainties could further impact margins and growth.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Nathan's Famous here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

Users can upload their own documents and receive responses based on that content. The interface also includes a preview mode with HTML support and the ability to process uploaded images for visual analysis.\n\nVideo: Qwen\n\nAd\n\nAd THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. \u2713 Weekly \u2713 Free \u2713 Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty\n\nAlibaba plans to expand the platform's capabilities with web search, image generation capabilities, and voice interaction mode. Like other AI models developed in China, the Qwen models include content filtering that restricts content critical of the government.\n\nAlibaba's growing family of models\n\nAlibaba's cloud division has been steadily building its AI capabilities since introducing the first Qwen models in August 2023. The newer Qwen2 series brought notable improvements across several areas, including programming, mathematics, logical reasoning, and support for multiple languages.\n\nThe current Qwen 2.5 series comes in three flavors: a general-purpose language model, Qwen2.5-Coder for programming tasks, and Qwen2.5-Math for mathematical problems. Most of these models are available as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nThe team recently expanded into AI agents with their new Qwen-Agent framework, which builds on their existing language models. The system can follow instructions, work with various tools, plan complex tasks, and maintain context during conversations. It also includes some advanced features, like RAG integration and a specialized math reasoning system powered by Qwen2.5-Math.\n\nTheir latest experiment, QwQ-32B-Preview, takes a page from OpenAI's playbook by focusing on test-time compute scaling for better logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. The model follows similar principles to OpenAI's o1 approach to improve its performance.\n\nAd",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nThe Future of Rate Cuts in 2025\n\nThe latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025.\n\nSanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are \"thinking about yields.\" She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward.\n\nSanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out.\n\nThe market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "This tech giant could be a massive winner in the coming years.\n\n2024 was an excellent year for the stock market as many companies delivered respectable returns to investors. As 2025 begins, investors are looking for opportunities that can deliver solid long-term growth while remaining resilient in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nOne company that could make it onto investors' radar is Alibaba (BABA 5.72%), a leading tech giant based in China. With its dominant position in e-commerce, cloud computing, and fintech, Alibaba could be a stock worth buying and holding for the next five years.\n\nA widely diversified tech conglomerate\n\nIt is no secret that Alibaba has always been the bedrock of the Chinese e-commerce industry, even as it has faced competition from existing and newcomers like JD.com and PDD. As of this writing, it owns about 46% of the e-commerce market share in China. But beyond e-commerce, Alibaba is also a major player in industries including cloud computing, logistics, fintech, and others.\n\nTake Alibaba Cloud, for example. It is the most significant player in China, with a 36% market share, and in the Asia Pacific region, with a 19.6% market share. Similarly, Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao, is one of the key players in the Chinese logistics industry and also owns a cross-border logistics delivery business that helps merchants on international platforms like AliExpress and Tmall Global sell globally.\n\nAlibaba's diversified business model reduces reliance on any single revenue stream, mitigates risks from market-specific challenges, and positions Alibaba to capitalize on emerging opportunities globally. For instance, Alibaba has been growing its international e-commerce business in recent years as its Chinese e-commerce business, while dominant, is a mature business with slower growth rates. In the three months that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the international business delivered 29% growth, while the Chinese e-commerce business grew at just 1%.\n\nAlso, such diversification offers stability, especially when weathering volatile economic conditions. This offers better comfort to investors, knowing that the tech giant's earnings will remain resilient even during challenging market conditions.\n\nRising with artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nOne of the biggest complaints investors have about Alibaba is its slowing growth rates. Due to its huge success in the past, the giant is finding it much more difficult to sustain its historical growth rates.\n\nWhile there are some truths in this, there are still forces that the tech company can leverage to sustain its long-term growth. One huge trend that could transform Alibaba's prospects is the development of AI.\n\nThe most apparent opportunity AI will bring to Alibaba is its cloud computing business. The rise of AI will lead to exponential growth in demand for cloud computing infrastructure as businesses require scalable and efficient solutions to train AI models and deploy intelligent applications. As China's largest cloud computing provider, Alibaba Cloud is well positioned to leverage its innovative technologies in areas like large language models (LLMs) and its scaled infrastructure to offer customers affordable solutions.\n\nBesides, the ongoing development of AI technology will lead to new business opportunities in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics, smart cities, etc. Alibaba Cloud can leverage its existing resources and market position to grow in these new areas.\n\nEven Alibaba's existing e-commerce business could see a boost as the company incorporates new AI technologies for transformation. For instance, generative AI tools like automated customer service and advanced AI-driven recommendations could improve customer experience, leading to higher customer conversion, satisfaction, and retention. Moreover, using AI will improve operational efficiency in areas like fulfillment and logistics, leading to better cost control and margins.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nThe last few years have been challenging for Alibaba as it faced multiple challenges, such as a crackdown by the Chinese government and slower growth. Unsurprisingly, most investors have shunned Alibaba's stock, which explains the massive fall in share price -- more than 70% from its peak of $310.\n\nStill, it's too early to write off the tech giant, especially as the new management team tirelessly works to turn around the ship by improving customer experience and investing in AI. If successful, Alibaba could enter a new chapter of growth again.\n\nAs a shareholder, I think there's a good chance it will succeed in its efforts.",

It maintains body coordination and realistic motion trajectories, setting a new standard for video generation. Additionally, it has achieved a milestone as the first video generation model to support text effects in both Chinese and English, meeting diverse creative needs across industries such as advertising and short video production.\n\n\n\nThe model is currently available for free on its official Chinese website. Individual developers and corporate users can explore its potential through Alibaba Cloud\u2019s generative AI platform, Model Studio.\n\nAlibaba Cloud Launches Tongyi Lingma AI Programmer for Enhanced Coding Efficiency\n\nOn January 8, Alibaba Cloud announced the full rollout of Tongyi Lingma AI Programmer, the first AI programming tool globally to support both VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. This advanced tool goes beyond traditional AI-assisted coding, enabling developers to collaborate with AI through conversational interactions to complete complex tasks such as end-to-end project development, issue resolution, and batch unit testing generation.\n\n\n\nPowered by the upgraded Qwen 2.5-coder model, the AI Programmer excels in generating accurate and efficient code. It supports complex tasks like multi-file code editing, allowing developers to simultaneously modify multiple files, compare changes, and adopt modifications with a single click. In case of unexpected outcomes or requirement changes, developers can easily revert to previous states using a snapshot feature.\n\n\n\nThe tool also significantly improves unit testing by enabling batch generation of tests for single or multiple code files. It can automatically compile, debug, and fix errors to enhance accuracy and test coverage. Additionally, Tongyi Lingma breaks language barriers in coding, empowering developers to work seamlessly across languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. For example, creating a fully functional and visually enhanced front-end page with user login and data management capabilities now takes just 10 minutes instead of half a day.\n\nCainiao Unveils Upgraded Autonomous Delivery Vehicle GT Pro\n\n\n\nCainiao has launched the GT Pro, its latest L4-level autonomous delivery vehicle for public roads, marking the first major upgrade since the Cainiao GT debuted in 2024. The GT Pro offers significant advancements in design, algorithm optimization, range, and interactive features. With dimensions comparable to a compact passenger vehicle, it is adaptable to diverse road scenarios and can carry 600\u2013800 parcels within a 5-cubic-meter cargo space, achieving an impressive 180-kilometer range.\n\nUpgrades include an interactive front light display for status communication and an enhanced sensor suite featuring one LiDAR and eleven high-definition cameras, enabling precise environmental perception. These enhancements improve its ability to detect and respond to surroundings more accurately.\n\n\n\nCainiao has accumulated over 5 million kilometers of real-world autonomous driving experience and has delivered more than 40 million parcels using autonomous vehicles, solidifying its leadership in the field. By December 2024, the GT series had been deployed across over 10 provinces in China, including Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangsu, with operations in more than 30 regions.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Cainiao aims to advance from high-precision mapping to map-free navigation, expand use cases such as supermarket deliveries, and develop customized GT Pro models to meet various business needs.

The PBOC also said it would prioritize \"the role of interest rate adjustments\" and place less emphasis on \"quantitative objectives\" for loan growth.\n\nIf China lowers interest rates, Chinese companies would benefit from improved consumer spending, higher stock valuations and potentially more investment and expansion as money would be cheaper to borrow.\n\nThe \"Big Short\" investor has hedged his China bets, however.

            "content": "Shinsegae Group and China\u2019s Alibaba Group have joined forces to form a strategic e-commerce alliance, a move that has drawn close attention from Coupang, South Korea\u2019s market leader in online retail.\n\nThe partnership, announced on January 6, could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the e-commerce sector.\n\nCoupang\u2019s senior executives reportedly convened shortly after the announcement to assess the potential impact and develop counterstrategies. The collaboration will create a joint venture involving Shinsegae\u2019s Gmarket and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress, both of which hold significant market presence.\n\nGmarket is ranked third in market share domestically, while AliExpress has shown remarkable user growth in South Korea since 2024.\n\nAliExpress\u2019s strategy centers on leveraging Gmarket\u2019s 600,000 sellers to meet growing demand for Korean products (K-products) abroad. However, industry observers believe that AliExpress will also intensify its focus on the Korean market, raising the stakes for Coupang.\n\nAccording to data from IGAWorks, as of December 2024, the combined monthly active users (MAUs) of AliExpress, Gmarket, and Auction reached US$13.9 million\u2014nearly half of Coupang\u2019s $32.02 million.\n\nWhile Coupang leads in transaction volume with an estimated $2.2 billion (57.53 per cent market share), Gmarket, Auction, and AliExpress collectively accounted for $421.040 (10.93 per cent). Analysts predict AliExpress could rapidly scale its sales by increasing the share of high-value K-products.\n\nThe new alliance may also escalate competition through aggressive discount campaigns, setting the stage for a direct showdown with Coupang. Coupled with recent logistics innovations, including CJ Logistics\u2019 introduction of 7-day delivery services, the market could see significant shifts.\n\nThis logistics upgrade benefits platforms like Naver, Gmarket, and AliExpress, allowing them to offer next-day delivery on weekends and holidays \u2013 a direct challenge to Coupang\u2019s signature Rocket Delivery service.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest these developments could erode Coupang\u2019s dominance, a position solidified during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWhat seemed like an unshakable lead for Coupang may face challenges from the Gmarket-AliExpress alliance,\u201d one expert noted.\n\nThe Shinsegae-Alibaba joint venture, along with Naver\u2019s shopping platform, is expected to formally launch in the first half of 2025. Logistics enhancements, such as CJ Logistics\u2019 expanded delivery network, may further shape the competitive landscape by late 2025.\n\nAs the e-commerce sector evolves, 2025 is shaping up to be the most challenging year for Coupang since its rise to dominance during the pandemic.\n\nWhether Coupang cements its position, transitions to a duopoly with Naver, or contends with Gmarket-AliExpress as a significant rival, the coming months will serve as a defining moment for South Korea\u2019s e-commerce market.\n\nThis story was originally published by Korea Bizwire.",

            "content": "Shinsegae Group recently unveiled a strategic partnership with Chinese tech giant Alibaba, valued at approximately 6 trillion won ($4.5 billion), aiming to rejuvenate its struggling e-commerce platform, Gmarket.\n\nDespite its dominance in brick-and-mortar retail market, such as the popular Emart stores, Shinsegae has struggled to secure a significant share of the nation's booming e-commerce sector, where its smaller rival Coupang holds a commanding lead.\n\nAnnounced on Dec. 26, the partnership involves a 50:50 joint venture, tentatively named Grand Opus Holdings, set to be launched within the first half of this year. While the details remain undisclosed, the collaboration is anticipated to leverage Alibaba's extensive global distribution network to expand Gmarket\u2019s reach into foreign markets.\n\nAn industry insider noted potential challenges: \u201cGmarket may benefit from Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure, but Korean consumers' skepticism about Alibaba products could pose risks for both Gmarket and Shinsegae.\u201d\n\nUphill battle in e-commerce\n\nShinsegae's flagship unit, Emart, acquired an 80 percent stake in Gmarket in June 2021 in its largest-ever buyout deal, worth 3.44 trillion won. However, Gmarket has struggled with operating losses in recent years, despite posting profits of 4.3 billion won in 2021.\n\nGmarket reported operating losses of 65.4 billion won in 2022 and 32.1 billion won in 2023. For the first three quarters of 2024, cumulative losses reached 34.1 billion won.\n\nThe consumer response to the tie-up between the nation\u2019s major retail players has also been lukewarm. According to the data platform Mobile Index, Gmarket\u2019s combined monthly active users totaled 5.07 million last year, placing it last among the top five players. During the same period, market leader Coupang recorded 32 million users, while latecomer No. 3 AliExpress had 7.6 million users.\n\nIn a leadership reshuffle in June 2024, Shinsegae appointed Chung Hyung-kwon, a former Alibaba Korea executive and a close friend of Shinsegae Chairman Chung Yong-jin, as the new CEO of Gmarket. Chung previously held executive roles at Coupang as well.\n\nEmart is expected to use capital from Gmarket to set up the Alibaba joint venture, reducing its stake to 40 percent. For the new entity, sources say Chung, the Gmarket CEO, is highly likely to assume the leadership role.\n\nMixed outlook for synergy\n\nGmarket and Alibaba aim to create business synergies in the nation\u2019s highly competitive e-commerce market.\n\nWith a limited presence in global markets, Gmarket plans to leverage Alibaba\u2019s extensive global network to export Korean products, capitalizing on the growing popularity of Korean culture. Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress, which operates in nearly 180 countries, lowers entry barriers for Korean sellers by addressing language, marketing and regulatory challenges. Gmarket also anticipates diversifying its own product offerings by sourcing globally from Alibaba platforms.\n\nThe partnership is poised to reshape the nation's logistics landscape, intensifying competition in the ongoing quick delivery war sparked by Coupang\u2019s same-day Rocket Delivery service.\n\nIn June 2024, Shinsegae partnered with CJ Logistics, the market leader handling around 80 percent of Korean parcel deliveries for AliExpress, in its renewed push for e-commerce leadership.\n\n\u201cThe synergy between Gmarket and Alibaba could improve delivery speeds and cross-border shipping to compete with Coupang. However, integrating their operational systems seamlessly may take time,\u201d another industry official said.\n\nTies to Trump\n\nThe partnership unfolds amid escalating political turmoil in Korea, as impeachment proceedings against President Yoon Suk Yeol continue. Adding intrigue to the development, the joint venture announcement came just days after the Shinsegae chief had a highly publicized meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump in Florida late last month.\n\n\u201cChung\u2019s primary objective, beyond exploring US business opportunities, seems to be assessing Washington\u2019s stance on his new ventures involving China, particularly the collaboration with Alibaba,\u201d said Baek Seo-in, a professor of Chinese studies at Hanyang University.\n\n\u201cGiven the heightened risks in e-commerce due to ongoing tariff wars, being perceived as a \u2018quasi-Chinese\u2019 company could threaten opportunities. Chung appears to be shaping his China strategy based on sentiments and trends observed among high-ranking US officials.\u201d\n\nChung has been invited to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, showcasing his strong ties to Washington while advancing plans for the new Chinese venture.",

Now using Tongyi Lingma AI programmer, a programmer can complete the entire development process in just 10 minutes.\n\nThis time Tongyi Lingma AI programmer introduces multi-file code modification capability for the first time. Developers can automatically complete multi-file level coding tasks through AI programmers, such as requirement implementation, problem fixing, batch generation of unit tests.\n\nWhen generating unit tests, you can generate unit tests in batches for current code changes, single or multiple code files.\n\nIn this upgrade, Tongyi Lingma AI programmers have added various development capabilities such as context awareness, intent understanding, reflective iteration, and tool usage.\n\nIn the collaboration process between developers and AI programmers, both parties will gradually complete coding tasks through multi-round dialogues, generating multiple snapshot versions that developers can switch or roll back at will.\n\nSEE ALSO: Technology Giants Promote AI Programming Internally",

His contrarian wager was immortalized in the book and film \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe's also famous in financial circles for predicting market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop long before the video-game retailer became a meme stock. He also bet against Elon Musk's Tesla, Cathie Wood's flagship Ark fund, Apple, a microchip fund that included Nvidia, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes in recent years.\n\nBurry goes by Cassandra B.C. on X \u2014 a nod to the priestess in Greek mythology who was cursed to utter true prophecies but never to be believed.\n\nStaying quiet\n\nIn years past, Burry frequently shared his thoughts on the markets, economy, and other subjects on Twitter.\n\nFor example, in summer 2021, he warned of the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" and told buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening toward the \"mother of all crashes.\"\n\nBurry even caught Musk's attention with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO calling him a \"broken clock\" in late 2021. Moreover, the investor set alarm bells ringing on Wall Street in early 2023 with a one-word post: \"Sell.\"\n\nHowever, Burry didn't post at all last year and hasn't shared anything with his primary account's 1.4 million followers since April 2023.\n\nChinese trio\n\nBurry's Scion Asset Management revealed in a first-quarter portfolio update it had boosted its bets on Alibaba and JD.com, two Chinese e-commerce titans. It also established a small position in Baidu, a search giant that's been dubbed the \"Chinese Google.\"\n\nThe Scion chief added to both the Alibaba and Baidu positions in the second quarter while paring his JD.com stake, but then ramped up all three wagers in the third quarter.\n\nIn the 12 months before September 2024, Scion quadrupled both its Alibaba and JD.com stakes. It went from owning 50,000 Alibaba shares worth $4.4 million to 200,000 shares worth $21.2 million.\n\nIt raised its JD.com position from 125,000 shares worth $3.6 million to 500,000 worth $20 million. Starting from scratch, it also amassed 125,000 Baidu shares worth $13.2 million in the nine months before this past September.\n\nThose three stocks accounted for 65% of the total $83 million value of Scion's portfolio, excluding options, at the end of September. Burry hedged his highly concentrated portfolio by purchasing put options against the three stocks with a notional value of $47 million in the third quarter.\n\nBurry, a value investor who hunts for bargains, may have pounced on the trio because he views them as undervalued. Chinese stocks have been hit by regulatory threats, concerns about the country's slowing economy and real-estate crisis, rising geopolitical jitters, and skepticism about the government's stimulus plans.\n\nIt's worth noting that quarterly portfolio filings only paint a partial picture of an investor's holdings. They exclude shares sold short, private investments, foreign-listed stocks, and non-stock assets like bonds and real estate. They're also only a snapshot of the portfolio on a single day in a three-month period.\n\nPatience pays off\n\nApart from Alibaba and JD.com, the only stock that Scion held onto for all of 2024 was The RealReal, an online luxury-goods marketplace.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe stock has featured in Scion's portfolio since the first quarter of 2023, when the firm owned 684,000 shares worth about $862,000, or $1.26 each.\n\nScion still owned 500,000 shares at the end of September, worth nearly $1.6 million at that time. The stock has jumped from a little over $3 then to $8.73 at Wednesday's close.\n\nThe upshot is Burry has likely made several times his money on The RealReal, especially if he was still holding the stock when it surged last quarter.",

            "content": "In the past, Alibaba (BABA 5.72%) was often viewed as the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of China. But the stocks of the two companies have been on completely different paths over the past decade. While Amazon's stock is up more than 1,400% in the past 10 years, as of this writing, Alibaba's stock is actually down more than 15%.\n\nWhile its stock has struggled, Alibaba's operational performance has actually been quite solid over the past 10 years. The company grew its revenue more than 10 times from $12.3 billion in 2015 to $130.3 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, its operating income rose from $3.9 billion in 2015 to $14.1 billion in 2024.\n\nWhile growth slowed the past few years, the company is working to reignite growth. Let's see if the stock has what it takes to be an investment that sets you up for life.\n\nThe Amazon of China\n\nLike Amazon, Alibaba is involved in e-commerce, logistics, and cloud computing, among other businesses.\n\nWithin e-commerce, it owns the popular Tmall and Taobao platforms. Tmall is a business-to-consumer marketplace in China that established brands use to sell their goods. Taobao, meanwhile, allows both businesses and consumers to sell on its platform.\n\nGrowth within Alibaba's e-commerce segment has recently been slow due to a sluggish Chinese economy and intense competition -- particularly from rival PDD Holdings, which owns the popular Pinduoduo platform in China. Revenue for Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao segment only increased 1% last quarter.\n\nHowever, following a period of investment into its platforms to improve price competitiveness, technology, and customer service, Alibaba implemented a new software service fee based on the gross merchandise value of completed transactions on its platforms, replacing an annual service fee on its Tmall platform. It also has started to see good uptake with its new artificial intellingence (AI)-powered platform-wide marketing tool Quanzhantui. Together, these initiatives should start to reignite revenue growth.\n\nWithin e-commerce, Alibaba also owns two fast-growing cross-border platforms: AliExpress and Trendyol. Last quarter, this segment saw revenue jump 29% to $4.5 billion. Currently, the company is working to build the platforms in Europe and the Gulf region in the Middle East. As such, this segment is not yet profitable.\n\nAlso similar to Amazon, Alibaba has a cloud computing business, but unlike its U.S. counterpart, this is not its most profitable business. This segment grew revenue by 7% last quarter, while segment EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes and amortization) soared 89% to $379 million. The company has been letting low-margin project-based contracts roll off, which has impacted revenue growth but improved profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba has seen five straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth from AI-related products and services. While it doesn't have access to the latest AI-chip technology that U.S. companies do, Alibaba is nonetheless investing heavily in AI-related cloud infrastructure. In September, it launched more than 100 new open-source AI models as well as a text-to-video generation tool. However, it recently slashed prices on its large language models to drive adoption as competition in the space remains heightened in China.\n\nA cheap stock with a good upside\n\nFrom a valuation perspective Alibaba is incredibly cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 9 times based on next year's analyst estimates. Meanwhile, it has $43.6 billion in net cash on its balance sheet plus another $49.1 billion in equity security investments in the companies it owns, including Ant Group, Xpeng, and Weibo, among others. Excluding just its net cash, it trades under 7 times forward P/E.\n\nNot surprisingly, Alibaba's valuation has attracted some big investors, including billionaire investor David Tepper of Appaloosa Management. The stock was Tepper's top holding at the end of Q3, representing more than 15% of his portfolio. Tepper appears to be a big fan of Chinese stocks, with PDD and JD.com also among his top 10 holdings.\n\nThe Chinese government has been trying to stimulate its economy, and there are further calls for this to continue in 2025, especially with threats of increased U.S. tariffs. A better domestic economy would go a long way toward helping Alibaba and its stock. Meanwhile, the company has taken strides to improve its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also generates a lot of cash, which it has been using to buy back shares.\n\nIf Alibaba were to trade at a similar valuation to Amazon, it would have close to 4 times upside, while if it grew to the size of Amazon it would have have more than 10 times upside. While I don't think either of those scenarios are likely, I do think Alibaba can rebound and that its valuation multiple can nicely increase, giving investors solid upside potential. But an investment in the stock isn't likely to set you up for life.",

Since it launched in 2011, WeChat, known as Weixin domestically, has added many functions, including payments, shopping and short videos.\n\nOver the years, Alibaba has been trying to encroach onto Tencent's home turf by expanding into social networking, including rolling out an instant messaging app called Laiwang in 2013, and adding a feature to Taobao in 2021 that allowed users to shop together via a voice call. However, both these are now discontinued.\n\nAmid the fierce competition, China's internet giants have been forced to open their previously closed ecosystems to each other under Beijing's antitrust campaign.\n\nIn September, Alibaba announced that its Taobao and Tmall marketplaces would accept WeChat as a payment option, along with Alipay. As of early October, Tencent had enabled WeChat users to open Taobao links and place orders within the messaging app.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Abandoning large model training? Fully acquired by Alibaba? In the first week of 2025, 01.AI, one of China\u2019s most-watched artificial intelligence startups, sparked a storm of speculation and debate.\n\nOn January 7, 36Kr sat down with Kai-Fu Lee, the founder of 01.AI and renowned AI entrepreneur, for an exclusive interview. Lee addressed the company\u2019s recent staffing changes and restructuring efforts.\n\n\u201cWhat works for a startup in its first year may not work in its second,\u201d Lee told 36Kr. \u201cAdjustments and transitions are a natural part of entrepreneurship. 2025 marks a decisive year for commercialization, and 01.AI must realign its priorities accordingly.\u201d\n\nJust a day earlier, an online rumor claimed that 01.AI had sold its pre-training and infrastructure teams to Alibaba. That evening, Lee personally denied the allegations on social media.employees dedicated to training super-large models had joined the company\u2019s large industrial model laboratory, a joint initiative with Alibaba Cloud.\n\nAccording to Lee, the restructuring began in mid-December 2024 when both teams were informed of their reassignment. By late December, members of the pre-training team had received offers from Alibaba\u2019s Tongyi division, while the infrastructure team was absorbed into Alibaba Cloud.\n\nThe background of this restructuring lies in 01.AI\u2019s realization: pre-training massive models is no longer cost-effective for startups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that only tech giants can [bear the costs of training super-large models],\u201d Lee said. Since 2024, 01.AI has shifted its focus to developing small-parameter, industry-specific models. He emphasized that super-large models hold significant value as \u201cteacher models,\u201d transferring their capabilities to smaller ones. This makes the partnership with a tech giant capable of handling large-scale model training essential.\n\nFor 01.AI, that partner turned out to be its major investor, Alibaba. \u201cMany team members still harbor dreams of artificial general intelligence (AGI), and those individuals are welcome to join the laboratory,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAs for rumors about selling GPUs, Lee clarified that 01.AI relies on cloud services to train its models: \u201cWe don\u2019t own GPUs, so it\u2019s impossible for us to sell them.\u201d\n\nThe most pressing challenge for 01.AI in 2025 is profitability. Alongside revising its model training strategy, the company plans to spin off its gaming, finance, and other AI applications into independent units. This move aims to streamline operations and secure funding tailored to specific verticals.\n\nThis decision stems from Lee\u2019s experience with project incubation at Sinovation Ventures. According to him, teams focusing on specific verticals tend to achieve greater depth and impact.\n\nPractical considerations also underpin these spinoffs. \u201cFirst, we talk to investors to gauge interest. If no one is willing to invest, there\u2019s no point in spinning off the business because it won\u2019t be self-sustainable,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cStartups must carefully allocate every dollar,\u201d he added. \u201cSpending on more GPUs to train large models isn\u2019t the way forward for survival.\u201d\n\nThe following interview has been edited and consolidated for brevity and clarity.\n\n36Kr: What happened with 01.AI\u2019s pre-training and infrastructure teams?\n\nKai-Fu Lee (KL): We\u2019ve been collaborating closely with our major investor, Alibaba, to establish a joint laboratory dedicated to large industrial models. This lab, led by Alibaba, focuses on scaling law research.\n\nSome of our team members who specialize in and are deeply committed to this area have joined the lab and integrated closely with Alibaba\u2019s efforts.\n\n36Kr: Does this mean that members of the pre-training and infrastructure teams were given a choice between joining Alibaba or staying with 01.AI?\n\nKL: I\u2019d rather not delve into specific details here.\n\nWhat I can say is that there\u2019s immense potential in training super-large models right now, and Alibaba has decided to pursue this space aggressively. We commend its dedication. Over the past year and a half, we\u2019ve had exceptional team members passionate about large-scale model training, so it\u2019s a natural fit for them to align with Alibaba\u2019s initiatives.\n\n36Kr: Does this mean 01.AI has officially moved away from pre-training?\n\nKL: Our approach to pre-training is pragmatic. We focus on developing smaller, faster models that deliver high commercial value.\n\nPreviously, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever noted that scaling laws may have reached their limits. Training ever-larger models is becoming prohibitively expensive, with diminishing returns. It\u2019s clear that only tech giants can afford to pursue this path.\n\nOur Yi-Lightning model, which features billions of parameters, received strong market feedback in 2024. Looking ahead, 01.AI will prioritize faster, smaller, and more cost-effective models. Any future training efforts won\u2019t exceed the scale of Yi-Lightning.\n\n36Kr: With the new lab formed by 01.AI and Alibaba Cloud to train super-large models, what roles do the two parties play?\n\nKL: The value of super-large models lies in their ability to function as \u201cteacher models,\u201d imparting their capabilities to smaller ones through techniques like data distillation and data synthesis. This is a key strategy for training models.\n\nAlthough large models are expensive and slow to train, they are strategically important in China\u2019s tech ecosystem, particularly given global tech restrictions. Maintaining innovation in this area is critical for securing a strong technological foundation.\n\nWe concluded that partnering with a tech giant capable of supporting large-scale model training is the optimal path forward. Alibaba takes on the training of these massive models, while our nimble and efficient teams concentrate on developing smaller, cost-effective models that drive practical applications and market growth.\n\nFor those still passionate about building super-large models, the joint lab provides an ideal platform to pursue that vision.\n\n36Kr: There are rumors that 01.AI sold its GPUs to Alibaba. Could you clarify?\n\nKL: I\u2019m not sure where that rumor started. We don\u2019t own GPUs, so it\u2019s impossible for us to sell them. I can\u2019t comment further on something baseless.\n\n36Kr: Is it common for AI startups to rely on cloud services rather than own GPU clusters?\n\nKL: It\u2019s widely understood that small companies are not well-suited for training super-large models. Even organizations with tens of thousands of GPUs should evaluate whether maintaining those resources aligns with their strategic goals if they\u2019re not actively pursuing large-scale model training.\n\nThis is a common industry consideration. Our decision to step away from this path doesn\u2019t stem from doubt about scaling laws. Instead, it reflects a pragmatic focus on partnering with a tech giant like Alibaba to manage resource-intensive aspects. It\u2019s the most sustainable approach for survival and growth.\n\n36Kr: In your social media post addressing rumors, you mentioned that 01.AI confirmed revenue exceeding RMB 100 million (USD 14 million) in 2024. What were the primary revenue sources?\n\nKL: Initially, we concentrated on consumer-facing products, particularly for international markets. Early on, we recognized that commercializing B2C products in China in 2024 would be challenging, so we refrained from spending on customer acquisition for domestic B2C offerings.\n\nFor our consumer business, about 20\u201330% of last year\u2019s revenue came from paid overseas productivity tools like PopAi.\n\n36Kr: Does this mean 70% of revenue came from enterprise clients?\n\nKL: That\u2019s correct. In the second half of 2024, we shifted our focus to enterprise clients. After refining our large model technology, we turned to identifying specific applications and use cases.\n\nWe explored a range of industries, seeing significant growth in gaming and achieving notable results in finance and energy sectors.\n\n36Kr: Transitioning from B2C in the first half to B2B in the second half seems like a major shift in business focus.\n\nKL: While external observers may view the changes beginning in early January 2025, we had actually been planning this transition for months. Systematic adjustments to our organizational structure, resource allocation, and project priorities had been underway, with milestones becoming apparent by year-end.\n\nFor example, discussions with Alibaba regarding the joint lab were ongoing for some time before the recent announcement.\n\n36Kr: How has 01.AI\u2019s organization and resource allocation evolved over the past year?\n\nKL: We\u2019ve restructured to strengthen our B2B capabilities and build industry partnerships for specialized large models. This involved bolstering teams in key areas such as presales, customer demand analysis, product development, and commercial strategy.\n\nAdditionally, we reinforced our engineering and development teams to focus on standardization and platformization, steering clear of one-off projects that often result in losses.\n\n36Kr: With 01.AI focusing on training smaller models, what is your commercialization strategy?\n\nKL: We see fast, high-value models as particularly well-suited for industry-specific applications. This doesn\u2019t mean creating extremely small models with just three or four billion parameters, as those are often inadequate for many use cases.\n\nInstead, our goal is to develop models comparable in scale to Yi-Lightning or slightly smaller, ensuring they remain versatile and applicable across various industries.\n\n36Kr: 01.AI entered the enterprise market relatively late. How do you plan to overcome this latecomer disadvantage?\n\nKL: We\u2019re focusing on a few core verticals. Unlike some AI companies that can hire 300 salespeople, we\u2019re leveraging my personal network to break into specific high-value domains and find industries where we can deliver standard solutions.\n\nWe\u2019re also collaborating with Sinovation Ventures, which has incubated many complementary companies. These partnerships are highly synergistic and allow us to work together effectively.\n\nMoreover, we believe industry-specific models need further segmentation. For instance, we don\u2019t view finance as a singular sector\u2014it can be divided into numerous subfields. I can\u2019t share further details here, as revealing our plans could give competitors an edge.\n\n36Kr: During an internal meeting earlier this month, you emphasized that 01.AI must fully align with applications. Can you elaborate?\n\nKL: Initially, our focus was on pursuing AGI, which allowed us to attract highly skilled technical talent and develop world-class technology.\n\nBut to some extent, 2025 will be a decisive year for the commercial success of large model companies. If we fail to demonstrate that our technology delivers real-world applications, we risk being left behind.\n\n36Kr: What are the benchmarks for proving real-world applications? User numbers? Revenue? Profit?\n\nKL: The core criterion is whether an application generates revenue. It\u2019s not about blindly pursuing user growth or increasing traffic\u2014it\u2019s about sustainability and income generation.\n\nWhen I say \u201calign with applications,\u201d I mean that without a profitable application, you\u2019re essentially running a tech lab.\n\n36Kr: Reports suggest that some of 01.AI\u2019s business lines have been spun off into separate companies for independent operations and external funding. What drove this decision?\n\nKL: It aligns with the incubation model I developed at Sinovation Ventures. For instance, our AI gaming subsidiary was recently spun off. We had been operating this business for several months and concluded that it had the potential to stand on its own.\n\n36Kr: Why spin off certain businesses?\n\nKL: When a team is deeply focused on a single vertical with strong growth potential, it\u2019s better positioned to achieve excellence and make a significant impact.\n\nCompared to being part of a broader team working across multiple industries, a standalone entity can devote its full attention to its domain and access resources tailored to its specific needs.\n\n36Kr: How do you evaluate whether a business should be spun off?\n\nKL: First, we talk to investors to gauge interest. If no one is willing to invest, there\u2019s no point in spinning off the business because it won\u2019t be self-sustainable.\n\n36Kr: It\u2019s rare for a startup to pursue so many business directions simultaneously. Doesn\u2019t this dilute your focus?\n\nKL: Our goal is to create a platform for enterprise clients. Centralized R&D costs are shared across business lines\u2014maybe 20% goes to one area, 30% to another, and 50% toward general-purpose tools and infrastructure.\n\nSometimes, business success is driven by market trends or emerging concepts. It\u2019s hard to plan everything in advance\u2014you have to adapt as you go. Ideally, we aim to develop a few standout product lines in 2025.\n\n36Kr: After the past year and a half, what new insights do you have about AI entrepreneurship?\n\nKL: Be bold in making proactive adjustments and recognize the right strategic path. What works for a startup in its first year may not work in its second. Clinging to unsustainable practices can be harmful to the company.\n\nWe hope to build a more certain future for 01.AI, giving us greater confidence in achieving our goals.\n\nKrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

            "content": "ading to a reassessment of valuations and future investment strategies within China\u2019s hypermarket sector,\u201d Derek Burke, chief commercial officer and co-founder at Amilo told Inside Retail. \u201cThe divestment suggests that integrating large-scale physical retail operations with digital platforms presents significant challenges. Hypermarket operators may need to innovate and adapt to the rapidly evolving retail environment to remain competitive.\u201d Sun Art is known as a leading hypermarket and omnichannel retailer in China, with hypermarkets, superstores and membership stores under RT-Mart, RT-Super and M-Club. As of September 30, Sun Art had a total of 466 hypermarkets, 30 superstores and six membership stores in the country. Alibaba acquired a 36.16 per cent stake in Sun Art for HK$22.4 billion in 2017 before securing a controlling stake in 2020 for US$3.5 billion. The company said in a filing the acquisition would help it \u201cmonetise its non-core assets and to utilise such proceeds to better focus on the development of its core businesses and enhance its shareholder return\u201d. The divestment of Sun Art follows Alibaba\u2019s pattern of streamlining its offline retail holdings, with the company appearing to cut losses and refocus on its core digital businesses. Last month, the e-commerce giant was reported to sell department store Intime Retail to Chinese textile and clothing company Youngor Fashion for RMB7.4 billion ($1.02 billion) despite a $1.3 billion loss from the deal. \u201cWhen we look at the current state of e-commerce in China, Alibaba\u2019s decision reflects a broader industry trend where e-commerce platforms are reassessing the value of physical retail investments. The move underscores the challenges of integrating offline assets with online platforms and may suggest a strategic shift towards enhancing digital capabilities without the complexities of managing traditional retail operations,\u201d Burke said. According to the filing, Sun Art saw its financial performance decline significantly, reporting a net loss of RMB1.7 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31 compared to a modest profit of RMB78 million in the previous year. This strategic divestment comes at a crucial time for the Chinese e-commerce landscape, as competitive pressures continue to mount and consumer behaviors evolve rapidly. China\u2019s e-commerce competition has intensified as major platforms including PDD Holdings\u2019 Pinduoduo and Temu, as well as ByteDance\u2019s Douyin and TikTok, have aggressively expanded their market share by offering deeply discounted products. According to S&P Global, Alibaba can sustain its dominant position in China\u2019s e-commerce market due to its large customer base and extensive product range. However, the slowing growth of e-commerce in China and the rise of newer platforms are loosening its grip on the market. Burke said streamlining its operations to concentrate on its primary e-commerce and cloud computing businesses allows Alibaba to allocate resources more effectively, enhancing its competitive advantage against rivals such as JD.com and Pinduoduo, who are also vying for dominance in China\u2019s e-commerce sector. In November, Alibaba said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday that it would integrate its domestic Chinese and international e-commerce platforms into a single business unit run by one leader for the first time. The new unit, named the Alibaba E-commerce Business Group, brings together the Taobao and Tmall Group and the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) Group. In 2023, Alibaba underwent the largest restructuring in its 24-year history by splitting into six business units \u2013 Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, Local Services Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Group, Global Digital Commerce Group and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. \u201cBy focusing on e-commerce and cloud computing, Alibaba is strategically positioning itself to harness the rapid growth in digital commerce and AI-driven solutions,\u201d Burke said.

            "content": "SEOUL, Jan. 7 (Korea Bizwire) \u2014 Shinsegae Group and China\u2019s Alibaba Group have joined forces to form a strategic e-commerce alliance, a move that has drawn close attention from Coupang, South Korea\u2019s market leader in online retail.\n\nThe partnership, announced on January 6, could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the e-commerce sector.\n\nCoupang\u2019s senior executives reportedly convened shortly after the announcement to assess the potential impact and develop counterstrategies. The collaboration will create a joint venture involving Shinsegae\u2019s Gmarket and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress, both of which hold significant market presence.\n\nGmarket is ranked third in market share domestically, while AliExpress has shown remarkable user growth in South Korea since 2024.\n\nAliExpress\u2019s strategy centers on leveraging Gmarket\u2019s 600,000 sellers to meet growing demand for Korean products (K-products) abroad. However, industry observers believe that AliExpress will also intensify its focus on the Korean market, raising the stakes for Coupang.\n\nAccording to data from IGAWorks, as of December 2024, the combined monthly active users (MAUs) of AliExpress, Gmarket, and Auction reached 13.9 million\u2014nearly half of Coupang\u2019s 32.02 million.\n\nWhile Coupang leads in transaction volume with an estimated \u20a93.23 trillion (57.53% market share), Gmarket, Auction, and AliExpress collectively accounted for \u20a9614.6 billion (10.93%). Analysts predict AliExpress could rapidly scale its sales by increasing the share of high-value K-products.\n\nThe new alliance may also escalate competition through aggressive discount campaigns, setting the stage for a direct showdown with Coupang. Coupled with recent logistics innovations, including CJ Logistics\u2019 introduction of 7-day delivery services, the market could see significant shifts.\n\nThis logistics upgrade benefits platforms like Naver, Gmarket, and AliExpress, allowing them to offer next-day delivery on weekends and holidays\u2014a direct challenge to Coupang\u2019s signature Rocket Delivery service.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest these developments could erode Coupang\u2019s dominance, a position solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWhat seemed like an unshakable lead for Coupang may face challenges from the Gmarket-AliExpress alliance,\u201d one expert noted.\n\nThe Shinsegae-Alibaba joint venture, along with Naver\u2019s shopping platform, is expected to formally launch in the first half of 2025. Logistics enhancements, such as CJ Logistics\u2019 expanded delivery network, may further shape the competitive landscape by late 2025.\n\nAs the e-commerce sector evolves, 2025 is shaping up to be the most challenging year for Coupang since its rise to dominance during the pandemic.\n\nWhether Coupang cements its position, transitions to a duopoly with Naver, or contends with Gmarket-AliExpress as a significant rival, the coming months will serve as a defining moment for South Korea\u2019s e-commerce market.\n\nAshley Song (ashley@koreabizwire.com)",

Beijing-based 01.AI had revenue of more than CNY100 million (USD13.6 million) last year, Lee added.\n\nSources close to the matter previously told Yicai that Alibaba Cloud and 01.AI had agreed on a price for the team, with the deal involving around 60 staff dedicated to LLM pre-training. It would not cover 01.AI's other businesses, including its to-business operations in China and to-customer operations overseas, they noted.\n\nAlibaba Cloud and 01.AI said on Jan. 2 that they will link arms on setting up an Industrial Foundation Model Joint Laboratory, aiming to hasten the transition of foundation models to practical use and further enhance the ecosystem for industrial large models.\n\nThe tie-up serves as a means for Alibaba Cloud to integrate 01.AI's technology, business, and talent in the to-business fields through a partnership rather than an acquisition.\n\nThis year will be a critical one for Chinese LLMs, Lee pointed out.\n\nSeveral senior executives recently left 01.AI's pre-training team, with its leader Huang Wenhao joining TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance in August, while core member Li Xiangang left around the same time to return to realtor Ke Holdings.\n\nAfter Huang and Li's departure, 01.AI appointed a researcher to head up the pre-training team. LoRA, short for Low-Rank Adaptation, is a method for fine-tuning LLMs by reducing trainable parameters while minimizing the loss of model performance.\n\nThe researcher graduated from China's Beihang University and Kent State University in the United States and is based in North America. He has worked as a principal researcher at Microsoft's Azure AI.\n\nSeveral members of Alibaba Cloud's pre-training team also left previously, with the firm eager to find a strategic AI leader, sources said. The company has also consistently prioritized high-performance small models as a key strategic direction, with LoRA being one of the important methods to achieve its goals, they added.\n\nEditor: Martin Kadiev",

            "content": "Header photo source: Alibaba Group.\n\nOn January 1, Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group announced through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange its plan to sell its entire 78.7% stake in Sun Art Retail Group, the parent company of hypermarket chain RT-Mart, for up to HKD 12.298 billion (USD 1.6 billion). This transaction concludes Alibaba\u2019s exit from RT-Mart, following a share sale announcement on September 27, 2024.\n\nThe buyer, DCP Capital, will assume controlling ownership of RT-Mart after the deal is finalized.\n\nDCP Capital, a private equity firm based in Hangzhou, has a track record of investments in prominent companies such as Haier, Mengniu Dairy, Xingsheng Youxuan, Nanfu Battery, Belle International, and Hengan International. The firm\u2019s founder, Liu Haifeng, previously served as a global partner and president of Greater China at KKR before establishing DCP Capital in 2017. According to sources cited by 36Kr, DCP Capital employs a strategy akin to KKR\u2019s, focusing on late-stage investments and mergers and acquisitions, particularly in the consumer-focused sectors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s association with Sun Art began in 2017, when it acquired a 36.16% stake for HKD 22.4 billion (USD 2.9 billion). In 2020, it raised its ownership to 72% through additional investments, bringing its total expenditure to HKD 50.2 billion (USD 6.5 billion). This latest sale marks a financial loss of HKD 37.1 billion (USD 4.8 billion) for Alibaba.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Alibaba\u2019s partnership with RT-Mart has been a multifaceted integration into its ecosystem, spanning platforms like Taobao, Tmall, Freshippo (also known as Hema Fresh), and Ele.me. Initiatives such as Taoxianda sought to enhance RT-Mart\u2019s supply chain, delivery systems, technology infrastructure, and membership programs as part of the \u201cnew retail\u201d strategy blending online and offline retail operations.\n\nDespite these efforts, the integration failed to achieve the anticipated outcomes. RT-Mart\u2019s revenue declined consistently over the past three fiscal years, with single-digit drops in fiscal 2023, double-digit losses in fiscal 2024, and another single-digit reduction by mid-fiscal 2025. Profitability was similarly uneven, with RT-Mart posting its first midyear loss in fiscal 2023, briefly recovering, and then returning to losses in fiscal 2024 before achieving a modest turnaround by mid-fiscal 2025. Its stock value has plummeted to just one-fifth of its 2020 peak under Alibaba\u2019s ownership.\n\nBy 2024, as retail asset valuations continued to decline, the industry showed signs of rejuvenation led by competitors such as Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, and Pangdonglai. This market environment prompted Alibaba and other stakeholders to seek exits from retail investments, creating opportunities for buyers to secure assets at significantly reduced prices.\n\nA deal over a year in the making\n\nThe sale of Sun Art spanned more than a year and involved several rounds of negotiations. Information obtained by 36Kr outlines three stages in the process:\n\nDecember 2023 to March 2024: Alibaba began exploring potential buyers for RT-Mart. By March 2024, it was close to finalizing a deal to sell both Sun Art and Freshippo to COFCO, valuing RT-Mart at approximately RMB 10 billion (USD 1.4 billion) and Freshippo at RMB 20 billion (USD 2.8 billion). However, sources noted that COFCO was primarily interested in Freshippo, and the valuation for RT-Mart fell short of Alibaba\u2019s expectations, leading to the deal\u2019s collapse. August to October 2024: Several private equity firms visited RT-Mart stores for due diligence. By mid-October, executives from Sun Art and RT-Mart met with a consortium led by Hillhouse in Hangzhou. The proposed valuation, based on Sun Art\u2019s market capitalization at the time, saw Alibaba seeking 80% of its 2020 purchase price\u2014approximately HKD 40 billion (USD 5.2 billion). The high valuation led Ruentex Group, RT-Mart\u2019s original parent company, to withdraw from negotiations. DCP Capital joined the discussions during this period, but no agreement was reached. November 2024: After Hillhouse exited the negotiations, Alibaba entered exclusive talks with DCP Capital. By the end of the month, the deal was finalized at HKD 12.298 billion (USD 1.6 billion), significantly lower than the company\u2019s market capitalization of HKD 20 billion (USD 2.6 billion) during negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe price reflects two key factors: the market value of RT-Mart\u2019s assets, including self-owned properties, and the projected performance improvements from operational efficiencies under the new owner, discounted to the present,\u201d an industry insider said.\n\nSun Art\u2019s assets: A closer look\n\nSun Art\u2019s assets primarily include fixed properties and intangible resources such as brand value and supply chain networks. As of September 30, 2024, Sun Art operated 466 hypermarkets, 30 medium-sized supermarkets, and six membership stores, encompassing approximately 14 million square meters of retail space. Of this total, 34% of the space in hypermarkets and supermarkets is self-owned, with the remaining 66% leased. Notably, four out of six membership stores are located on self-owned properties. Sun Art also oversees an extensive warehouse and distribution network, which previously supported initiatives like Taoxianda and Hexiaoma.\n\nThe 34% rate of self-owned properties is significantly higher than the industry norm. For example, Walmart operates more than 300 stores in China, nearly all of which are leased. Similarly, Yonghui Superstores, with nearly 1,000 locations nationwide, owns only 10 properties. This makes RT-Mart\u2019s asset base notably robust. In contrast, Yonghui\u2019s asset-light model meant that property ownership had minimal impact on its valuation during its acquisition by Miniso.\n\nWhile acquiring discounted assets is often a key starting point in buyout deals, the real challenge lies in operational transformation\u2014enhancing performance and unlocking value.\n\nRetail industry insiders told 36Kr that RT-Mart remains an attractive investment target, having returned to profitability with a stronger business foundation than competitors like Yonghui, which continues to post losses. RT-Mart\u2019s strategically positioned, high-visibility stores in China\u2019s lower-tier cities benefit from steady foot traffic.\n\nHowever, modernizing retail operations remains a complex and costly endeavor. A report by Linkshop estimates that upgrading a single RT-Mart store to a \u201c2.0 format\u201d costs approximately RMB 10 million (USD 1.4 million). For comparison, recent upgrades to Yonghui stores have required investments of about RMB 20 million (USD 2.8 million) per location. With over 400 RT-Mart stores needing similar upgrades, the financial demands are substantial. Beyond physical renovations, reconfiguring product assortments and overhauling supply chains to meet modern consumer expectations will require significant capital and organizational effort. Moreover, traditional supermarkets face ongoing pressure to eliminate inefficiencies in back-of-house operations, further straining profit margins.\n\nWhile Alibaba incurred substantial losses in divesting Sun Art, the decision reflects broader strategic considerations amid challenging macroeconomic conditions and heightened competition in the retail sector.\n\nBy focusing on e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, Alibaba is repositioning itself for higher growth while divesting offline assets and optimizing its workforce. The sale of Sun Art reduces Alibaba\u2019s headcount by 85,778 employees, nearly halving its total workforce. While austere, this move marks a decisive step toward streamlining operations and aligning resources with its revised priorities.\n\nKrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

            "content": "The sudden formation of this e-commerce alliance between Shinsegae Group and China's Alibaba Group.has created a palpable sense of tension within the industry.\n\nOn Jan. 6, industry sources revealed that Coupang's senior management has instructed the formulation of strategies to assess the impact and determine the company's response to the announcement of a joint venture between Shinsegae Group and China's Alibaba Group. This new alliance, which includes Gmarket and AliExpress, has sent ripples through the domestic e-commerce market, with Coupang, the leading player, closely monitoring the developments.\n\nThe sudden formation of this e-commerce alliance has created a palpable sense of tension within the industry. AliExpress, which has partnered with Gmarket, is seen as a formidable contender due to its rapid user base growth in the Korean market since last year. Gmarket, ranking third in the domestic e-commerce market share, brings to the table its 600,000 sellers, which AliExpress plans to leverage to supply K-products in high demand overseas. Despite this international focus, the general industry view is that AliExpress will not abandon the Korean market.\n\nAccording to data platform company IGAWorks Mobile Index, as of December last year, the combined monthly active users of AliExpress, Gmarket, and Auction totaled 13.9 million, nearly half of Coupang's 32.02 million. The estimated credit card transaction amounts for Gmarket, Auction, and AliExpress were 387.4 billion won (approximately $286.9 million, 6.89% e-commerce market share), 113.7 billion won (2.02%), and 113.3 billion won (2.02%) respectively, totaling 614.6 billion won (10.93%). This figure still significantly trails behind Coupang's 3.2345 trillion won (57.53%).\n\nHowever, industry experts predict that if AliExpress increases the proportion of high-priced K-products in its sales, the transaction volume could expand rapidly. There are also predictions that an aggressive discount campaign on K-products, in partnership with Gmarket, could lead to a direct confrontation with Coupang.\n\nCoupang appears to be focusing on developing response strategies, viewing this as a variable that could immediately alter the dynamics of the domestic e-commerce market. The company's swift move to devise countermeasures immediately after the joint venture announcement is interpreted as an effort to minimize the associated risks.\n\nAdding to the competitive landscape, CJ Logistics, a major logistics company in South Korea, has started a 7-day delivery service from today. This new service eliminates delivery gaps on Sundays and holidays, enabling faster deliveries. The industry believes that the benefits will go to Naver, Gmarket, and AliExpress, which utilize CJ Logistics' system. If a delivery system is established where users of these platforms can receive orders placed on weekdays and weekends the next day, the concentration on Coupang, which has dominated the market with its rocket delivery, is likely to be alleviated.\n\nMany predict that the changes in the e-commerce market due to CJ Logistics' 7-day delivery will become visible as early as the second half of this year. The joint venture between Shinsegae and Alibaba, which includes Gmarket and AliExpress, and Naver's shopping app are expected to officially launch in the first half of the year. As the market dynamics continue to evolve, all eyes will be on how these strategic moves will reshape the competitive landscape in South Korea's e-commerce sector.",

Together, they comprise more than a quarter of the 4,500 registered exhibitors, making China the largest foreign participant this year.\n\nWhile this represents an increase from the 1,115 Chinese companies registered at CES in 2024 and the 493 listed in 2023 when Covid restrictions hampered international travel, this year\u2019s number still falls short of the record 1,551 Chinese exhibitors in 2018, when they made up over a third of all participants.\n\nNotably absent this year is ByteDance , which registered last year under its US office, although its subsidiary TikTok still has a presence. Also missing are big names that showed up in previous years, including Baidu , US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies , and drone maker DJI , which has been on a Pentagon blacklist since 2021.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding , owner of the South China Morning Post, maintains a presence with its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) unit Alibaba Cloud.\n\nA TikTok live-streaming booth at CES last year.

Right now, we have more than 500 game companies in T\u00fcrkiye,\" said Bar\u0131\u015f \u00d6zistek, chairman of Istanbul-based gaming company Joygame.\n\nIn contrast to the mobile gaming sector, console and PC gaming have experienced declines, with player numbers falling to 11 million and 20 million, respectively.\n\nPeak Games\u2019 $1.8 billion acquisition by Zynga in 2020 marked a turning point for T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s gaming industry as the country\u2019s first unicorn.\n\nY\u0131lmaz said 20 gaming companies were born from Peak Games following the company's exit in 2020, adding that the evolution of this realm as a \"stable\" industry is a \"process that might take some time.\"\n\n\u00d6zistek echoed these sentiments, noting the industry\u2019s evolution since Joygame\u2019s acquisition by South Korean giant Netmarble in 2013.\n\n\"That was the first time a game company exited T\u00fcrkiye. And that was the first time a global, multinational game company invested in that region, not only T\u00fcrkiye, but also in Eastern Europe and Middle East region.\"\n\nToday, Istanbul is a locomotive behind this rapid growth as Europe\u2019s second-largest gaming hub in terms of studio density, second only to London. This growth is supported by 13 game-focused venture funds and accelerators that provide early-stage funding and strategic guidance, empowering local talent to scale their ventures efficiently.\n\nYilmaz noted that the Turkish gaming market, roughly $1.5 billion in size, is on its way to exceed $2 billion in the next two years.\n\n\"T\u00fcrkiye will keep growing,\" Ozistek stated.\n\nAccording to him, the country commands a growing share in the global market, estimated to total $205-210 billion in 2024, thanks to its \"very successful companies and they are growing significantly every year.\"",

I think you\u2019d wind up with something like the wacky-looking electric cart that has earned the dubious honor of being named this week\u2019s Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week!\n\nI\u2019m not sure this is exactly an armored golf cart, so I wouldn\u2019t invite any unnecessary potshots while cruising your hood, but I\u2019m at a loss of how else to describe it.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not a \u201creal\u201d car, as evidenced by its US $6,999 price tag and the 30 km/h (18 mph) top speed. If you ask me though, that speed goes in the \u2018advantages\u2019 column. When you drive something that looks this good, you want to be going slow enough to give people a good, long look.\n\nA vehicle like this is designed to send a statement. Unfortunately, I think that statement might be, \u201cI wanted a Jeep but my spouse wanted to remodel the kitchen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nSo if it\u2019s not a real car, then what is it?\n\nMeasuring a stubby 306 cm long (an entire half inch over 10 feet), this four-seater mini-SUV is less G-Wagon and more \u201cOh, gee\u201d wagon. It can supposedly carry up to 370 kg (815 lb) in passengers or cargo, but there\u2019s no telling how much of a dent that puts in the already challenged top speed.\n\nSafety might also be a passing concern. It doesn\u2019t have any seatbelts, but the tires look like they just about extend out past the front and rear, so at least you\u2019ve got some nice shock-absorbent bumpers built into the design.\n\nThe advertisement claims a maximum range of up to 80 km (50 miles) per charge, which seems like several more miles than anyone needs from something like this.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on battery technology, which means I\u2019m assuming either features older lead acid tech or there\u2019s a frunk full of lemons and a bunch of loose wires running through the firewall.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see that the roof rack is at least equipped with enough LED lights to make an airport runway jealous, just in case I find myself stuck in the wilds of my backyard after dark. And that roof rack even looks pretty heavy-duty, though since the cart is considerably taller than it is wide, tight turns with a heavily-loaded roof rack should probably be avoided.\n\nAs much as I love this thing, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be whipping out my credit card any time soon.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve bought plenty of bad ideas on Alibaba before. But since my $2,000 electric truck ending up costing me nearly 4x that much by the time it landed in the US, I\u2019m a bit worried what the final price tag on a $6,999 Mini-MegaOverlander would become.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend anyone actually try buying this cute little TinyTrailblazer either, and I\u2019m certainly not vouching for the vendor, who I discovered by chance while scrolling through Alibaba to procrastinate real work. Keep in mind that this is all part of a tongue-in-cheek column I write, diving into the depths of Alibaba\u2019s weird and funny collection of awesome electric vehicles.\n\nBut hey, if someone does go that route, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time my advice has been ignored and some awesome photos have landed in inbox several months later. Just don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you if it turns out some Nigerian prince has your last paycheck and you\u2019re up a creek with no MicroMudder to come bail you out!\n\nWhen your local HOA finally gets its own tactical response unit",

            "content": "ImageFlow/Shutterstock\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues its rapid evolution, the coming year is poised to bring even more changes to how we live and work\u2014and the pace of change will accelerate in 2025.\n\nSimon Margolis, associate chief technology officer of AI/ML at IT consulting firm SADA, discussed the shifting AI landscape on the Cloud and Clear podcast. He emphasized, \u201cWe are not just seeing growth; we are seeing [a] continued explosion of the pace of innovation and what that means for businesses.\u201d Margolis also added that new AI platforms that make advanced technology accessible to more people are emerging, and problem-solving with AI is becoming more accessible to everyone\u2014even those without a tech background.\n\nThe latest AI trends can be summarized as responsiveness, personalization, and integration. Agents are transforming productivity by automating routine tasks, allowing people to focus on more strategic work. AI tutors can personalize education while bridging learning gaps and supporting students\u2019 individual needs, while emotion-aware AI assistants are making technology more responsive to human emotions. Meanwhile, digital avatars and AI immortality are extending our digital lives and helping to preserve memories.\n\nAs intelligent technology increasingly becomes part of our everyday lives, it promises to make a significant impact in the coming year. Creatie.ai compiled key trends in AI to watch for as companies race to dominate the technology being integrated into products and workflows.\n\nGorodenkoff // Shutterstock\n\nAI agents move beyond automation to logical problem-solving\n\nAI agents are reshaping workflows, promising to save time and enhance productivity at work. Microsoft describes agents as \u201cthe new apps for an AI-powered world,\u201d capable of handling tasks such as balancing financial data, compiling reports, and generating customer leads. Examples include Copilot Studio, which is integrated into Microsoft 365. It allows users to create tailored automation templates or even build custom agents without programming skills, freeing them to focus on strategic tasks, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe next leap for AI agents is reasoning\u2014the ability to break tasks into logical steps and execute them autonomously, with models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 series and Alibaba\u2019s QwQ-32B-Preview as clear standouts in the field. TechCrunch reports that Alibaba\u2019s model can solve challenging problems and, according to testing by the company, outperform OpenAI\u2019s o1-preview on reasoning benchmarks. These reasoning models are more advanced than earlier generative AI tools, with Alibaba\u2019s model designed to fact-check itself and reason step-by-step through complex tasks. However, it struggles with common-sense reasoning and maintaining language consistency.\n\nAt an industry summit, Scale AI Founder and CEO Alexandr Wang noted that agents could spark a \u201cChatGPT moment\u201d in 2025, with widespread adoption similar to the early days of generative AI, according to The Verge. Yet challenges remain. \u201cThe internet has shockingly little data of humans carrying [out] actions and documenting their thought processes as they go,\u201d Wang remarked.\n\nAs AI improves its reasoning skills, scaling challenges persist. Training large models like GPT-4 requires massive energy resources equivalent to powering 5,000 American homes for a year, which is far more than its predecessor. Meanwhile, the supply of high-quality training data might run out by 2028. Innovations like test-time compute, which gives models extra processing power for specific tasks, are emerging as solutions, TechCrunch reported. These improvements could make AI more efficient without relying on costly scaling.\n\nmetamorworks // Shutterstock\n\nAI tutors and the future of education\n\nAmid a shifting educational landscape, AI tutors could emerge as a possible way to reshape classrooms. Forty-seventh President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to shift educational oversight back to states raises questions about how schools might adapt to a reduced federal role, NPR reported. This shift creates the potential for a surge in AI-driven tutors, according to senior data scientists at the University of Chicago. Educators might also examine how AI might fill gaps in learning support.\n\nSupporters say AI tutors offer myriad benefits, including personalized instruction tailored to students\u2019 unique learning needs and greater accessibility. Platforms like Carnegie Learning and Khan Academy already use AI-driven tutors to deliver personalized academic support. These tools\u2019 strengths include addressing student weaknesses and creating interactive and engaging experiences by providing instant feedback and resources.\n\nExperts at the University of Chicago say integrating AI into education is \u201cno longer a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018how.'\u201d Still, others caution against overreliance on AI systems. Research from the University of North Florida published in the journal Advances in Engineering Innovation noted that educators should be aware of the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, potential biases in AI algorithms that might further inequalities, and the \u201cchallenge of integrating AI seamlessly into existing educational infrastructures.\u201d\n\nA Brookings task force also warned that gains in efficiency from automating tasks like grading or lesson planning should not come at the expense of human-centered instruction. Balancing AI\u2019s capabilities with traditional teaching approaches will be necessary to ensure technology enhances, rather than diminishes, learning and development. If implemented responsibly, however, AI could bridge educational gaps for underserved communities.\n\nImageFlow // Shutterstock\n\nDigital avatars and the promise of AI immortality\n\nIn a not-so-distant future, your digital self could continue telling your story long after you\u2019re gone. This is the promise of digital and AI immortality avatars. Research published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans found that virtual reality avatars typically used for social interactions are now expanding to social media and therapeutic contexts. These avatars offer varying levels of human resemblance, significantly influencing engagement and trust. This gives them vast potential, from helping individuals preserve their memories to allowing brands to create immersive, interactive campaigns.\n\nCompanies like Sensay are creating digital twins that replicate human knowledge, voice, and image, providing a sort of digital immortality. These avatars provide emotional support and help preserve memories that can comfort grieving family members or those supporting dementia patients, leaving a consistent digital legacy.\n\nOn the corporate side, brands are also increasingly integrating AI influencers into their broader digital campaigns to engage consumers in new ways. Virtual influencers are being used to promote everything from cosmetics to cars for brands like BMW, Maybelline, and Olaplex, per The Drum.\n\nAI influencers have the advantage of being customizable; since AI avatars can be tailored to different demographics, they can provide a level of personalization that traditional influencers cannot. Markets like China are leading the way in adopting virtual influencers for live streams and product endorsements, suggesting wider adoption is on its way.\n\nConsumers, however, can often sniff out gimmicks or inauthenticity, which raises concerns about the risk of undermining trust with audiences who may be skeptical of avatars and AI-driven personas. As AI avatars continue to evolve, storytelling, character development, and clear ethical guidelines will be crucial to maintaining authenticity and audience engagement.\n\nWho is Danny // Shutterstock\n\nThe rise of emotion-aware AI\n\nVirtual assistants can set reminders and answer questions. Soon, however, they\u2019ll be able to sense when you\u2019re having a rough day and offer a comforting response. Emotion-aware AI, or affective computing, is perhaps the most \u201cout there\u201d trend on this list. It pushes the boundaries of what we expect from technology.\n\nUnlike traditional AI, these assistants don\u2019t just complete tasks; they interpret body language. Emotion-aware AI adjusts its responses based on nonverbal cues like facial expressions and vocal tones, similar to human behavior, according to MIT Media Lab scientist Javier Hernandez.\n\nResearch published in the Journal of Business Research found that empathic AI-enabled voice assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, can increase user trust and engagement, especially in contexts like voice commerce. Empathic AI assistants combine practical functions with emotional connections to improve user experiences and build brand loyalty. According to researchers, however, careful design is needed to avoid making people uncomfortable, as overly humanlike empathy could cause unease.\n\nThis is already changing how companies understand customer experiences. In advertising, Affectiva uses technology that captures people\u2019s real-time reactions to advertisements to help brands see how viewers really feel. Cameras track emotional responses while watching commercials to give companies a deeper look at what makes an ad effective.\n\nThis approach goes beyond traditional surveys by showing moment-by-moment emotional changes. This technology is also expanding into other areas like automotive safety where it can help detect driver fatigue or distraction, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management reported.\n\nAffective computing technologies also have the potential to enhance public services by creating emotionally intelligent interfaces that adapt their approach to improve user experience, according to a 2024 report from Deloitte on affective computing. Emotion-aware technology is also being introduced in health care, which monitors patients\u2019 emotions to provide personalized care.\n\nHowever, as this technology evolves, ethical considerations around privacy and surveillance, consent, and bias must be at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT Sloan, emphasized the importance of designing inclusively, with diverse training datasets and ethical considerations to ensure privacy and cultural sensitivity.\n\n\u201cThe paradigm is not human versus machine\u2014it\u2019s really machine augmenting human,\u201d Brynjolfsson told MIT. \u201cIt\u2019s human plus machine.\u201d\n\nStory editing by Alizah Salario.

Apple Fitness+ can be an excellent way to do that, as it has activities for workouts such as working on your core, strength, kickboxing, cycling, walking or running on a treadmill, and even rowing. On top of that, it has ways of helping you with your mental health through meditation, Pilates, and yoga. It currently costs $9.99 a month and is accessible through the Fitness app.\n\nJournaling: This is another great way of not only improving and bettering your mental health, but it is a fantastic way of capturing every day life or at least the important days throughout the year. There are two apps that I have personally seen that are great for this, which are Day One Journal and the Apple Journal app. With that said, Day One Journal is available on more devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, whereas the Apple Journal app is only available on the iPhone right now.\n\nReading: If your goal or one of your goals this year was to read more, then there are some options for you such as Apple Books and the Kindle app. Both apps are available on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. On top of that, there is the Libby app that works through select local libraries as their method of ebook distribution. For those that still prefer reading physical books, there is always the option of buying books through apps like ThriftBooks and PangoBooks, which do accept Apple Pay as a payment method.\n\nLearn a new language: With so many apps and so much technology, we have made ways of learning new languages to be much easier. Furthermore, apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are available to download that can begin your journey into learning a new language this year.\n\nCooking: Many people out there love to learn new skills, with one of those being how to cook or at least cook something more than chicken nuggets in the microwave. The good news is there are plenty of apps that can help you do that in 2025, such as the New York Times Cooking: Recipes and Tips app, as well as the Kitchen Stories app. Once again, this is something too where Apple Books could be helpful since there are plenty of cookbook available for free or to purchase there. Again, if you are looking for a physical cookbook, my personal recommendation (and for some fun) would be 2024 Official Wizarding World Cookbook that can be purchased through Apple Pay-accepting merchants such as Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, and Target.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on are list? Are there any good ones we missed? What are your New Year\u2019s Resolutions for 2025? Comment below or let us know on X at @appleosophy.",

            "content": "As the features set of Apple Intelligence continued to increase with successive updates, there was always a concern that the base storage requirement would also witness a bump. Sadly, we have to be the bearer of bad news because the company has now stated that you must have 7GB of free space on each Apple device. Previously, we reported that Apple Intelligence\u2019s storage requirements were limited to 4GB, but now, if you want to experience generative AI features, there is a possibility that you purposely skip the base version as your daily driver next time you want to make a purchase.\n\nBumping up the storage requirements for Apple Intelligence makes sense, as some of the company\u2019s AI models will be running completely on-device\n\nThe first Apple Intelligence features were previously scheduled to launch with iOS 18 but were delayed and made their way to iOS 18.1. At the time, Apple had published various requirements if you wanted to begin using Apple Intelligence, which was 4GB of free internal memory. While the amount was not \u2018over the top,\u2019 we always contemplated that if the company were to continue increasing the number of features, would it raise those storage requirements? According to the information spotted by 9to5Mac, our hunch was right.\n\nTo run Apple Intelligence, you now need almost double the previous amount of storage on each device. The reasoning for upping that number is simple: Apple wants to maintain strict privacy measures for its users, which is why increasing the base storage requirement ensures that compatible devices can run these AI models on-device, and that requires some free space. In the new iOS 18.2 update, features such as Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT support, Image Wand, and others have been added.\n\nWith the eventual release of iOS 18.3, which is scheduled to happen this week, if we go by the launch of the previous iOS 17.3 update, those storage requirements could go up once again. If they do, our readers will be the first to be informed about this change, so stay tuned for more updates.",

With 47% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Alibaba Group Holding, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Alibaba Group Holding?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Alibaba Group Holding. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Alibaba Group Holding's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is SoftBank Group Corp., with ownership of 9.4%. With 5.5% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Alibaba Group Holding\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nShareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$3.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 42% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 9.4% of Alibaba Group Holding stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that , you should know about...\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This recommendation comes as consumption remains subdued and market volatility is anticipated to increase due to impending higher tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Eva Lee, head of Greater China equities at UBS, suggested that investors focus on stocks offering dividend yields above 6%, significantly higher than the 2% government yields. She highlighted a 4% yield gap as particularly appealing, recommending sectors such as banks, utilities, and energy.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Begin New Year On A Healthy Note: Analyst Says This Blue Chip Crypto Can Witness \u2018Good Amount Of Action\u2019 In Early 2025\n\nChinese stocks have had a rough start to 2025, with a 2.9% decline on Thursday marking the worst beginning to a year in nearly a decade. The CSI 300 Index continued its downward trend on Friday. Although last year\u2019s stimulus measures have helped stabilize the market, traders are wary of economic uncertainties as Trump\u2019s inauguration approaches.\n\nChina plans to issue more ultra-long special treasury bonds in 2025 to support consumer product trade-in programs and major projects. Meanwhile, the 10-year government bond yield fell below 1.6% on Friday, reflecting economic concerns and expectations for further monetary easing.\n\nWhy It Matters: The advice follows Chinese stocks experiencing a drop right after resuming trading after New Year\u2019s Day. The drop was attributed to a slowdown in manufacturing growth. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index for December fell to 50.5, missing analyst expectations. This slowdown is compounded by geopolitical tensions, including a semiconductor embargo from the U.S. and concerns over potential tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, the Trump administration plans to significantly increase tariffs on Chinese imports, with rates potentially rising by 20 percentage points. These developments are likely to impact both the Chinese and U.S. economies, affecting consumer prices and industrial production.\n\nPrice Action: As per Benzinga Pro, in after-hours trading, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR BABA slipped 0.047%, Baidu Inc BIDU rose 0.34%, and JD.com Inc JD edged up 0.18%. During the same period, Nio Inc \u2013 ADR NIO and Xpeng Inc \u2013 ADR XPEV were up nearly 1%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage via Shutterstock",

The framework also comes with advanced features including RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), a code interpreter, and specialized mathematical reasoning powered by Qwen2.5-Math.\n\nThe framework takes a two-tiered approach to agent development. The base layer provides language models and basic tools, while the top layer provides ready-to-use agent components. Developers can combine these pieces to build agents that can perform complex tasks - from reading PDFs to working with existing tools to performing custom functions. A real-world example is BrowserQwen, a web browsing agent/assistant that shows what the framework can do.\n\nFor implementation, developers can either use Alibaba's DashScope cloud service or run Qwen models on their own hardware.

Alibaba expects to book a loss of roughly $1.8 billion on the deal.

The tech giant said in November that it would combine its domestic Taobao and Tmall Group with its international e-commerce operations into a single business division.\n\nLast year was another so-so effort for Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares, as the company grappled with investor concerns about the broader Chinese economy. The stock gained 9% overall but still remains well below highs reached late in 2020.\n\nAlibaba shares rallied 27% in late September as government officials in China first rolled out stimulus plans.

It provides a way to represent the vendors\u2019 capabilities in a dynamic and fast-moving market.\u201d Alibaba Cloud recognized as an Emerging Leader in all four quadrants of the report: GenAI Specialized Cloud Infrastructure, GenAI Model Provider, GenAI Engineering, and AI Knowledge Management Apps/General Productivity.\n\nEMQ evaluates vendors based on two dimensions \u2013 Future Potential (x-axis) and Features (y-axis). According to Gartner: \u201cthe Future Potential axis looks at multiple factors that demonstrate a vendor\u2019s understanding of both the overall market and the submarkets, the features they are developing and offering to meet those emerging market needs, and their strategy to keep pace in an emerging and fluid market space\u201d; and for Features (y-axis), it \u201cfocuses on a vendor\u2019s offering in the submarket, specifically the features and quality thereof. We consider the vendor\u2019s viability as a GenAI provider, as well as frameworks and tool compatibility.\u201d\n\nCloud + AI to Accelerate AI Growth\n\nAlibaba Cloud is at the forefront of a new era of AI-driven innovation with its \u201cCloud+AI\u201d strategy. Pioneering the concept of \u201cModel as a Service\u201d (MaaS), Alibaba Cloud has set an industry standard that is quickly becoming the norm across the sector. During its annual flagship event, Apsara Conference 2024, Alibaba Cloud unveiled a slew of innovative updates in AI infrastructure, covering everything from green data center architecture, data management, to model training and inferencing. These advancements empower businesses across industries with a wide array of AI capabilities spanning infrastructure, AI models, and AI development platforms.\n\nA major highlight of Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI portfolio is the Qwen model series, a proprietary family of large language model introduced in April 2023. The latest iteration of the portfolio, Qwen2.5, enhances the model\u2019s knowledge and stronger capabilities in math and coding, while supporting over 29 languages. These models are tailored to power a wide array of AI applications, across various sectors from automobile, gaming to science research, both at the edge or in the cloud.\n\nSince their release, the Qwen models have gained significant traction with over 40 million downloads across platforms such as Hugging Face and ModelScope, Alibaba\u2019s open-source initiative. Furthermore, these models have inspired the creation of over 78,000 models on Hugging Face, further expanding the AI ecosystem.\n\nEmpowering Enterprises and Developers with Model Studio\n\nTo better enable enterprises and developers to create AI models and applications, Alibaba Cloud launched Model Studio, a premier GenAI development platform. Model Studio gives customers access to a wide range of Qwen models, offering both closed-source and open-source versions featuring multimodal capabilities. With model sizes that range from 0.5 billion to several hundred billion parameters, Model Studio facilitates the development of customised GenAI applications that meet the unique needs of various industries and scenarios.\n\nIndustries across the board have already been adopting Qwen, including companies from gaming, automobile, retail and smartphone sectors. As of September 2024, over 300,000 customers had engaged with Qwen through Model Studio, demonstrating the platform\u2019s broad appeal and its potential to revolutionize AI applications across industries.",

Designed to process and interpret both text and images, Qwen-VL is tailored for enterprise use, marking a departure from consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT. These discounts signal a competitive push to expand AI accessibility in the enterprise sector.\n\nThe move comes amid a broader race among Chinese tech giants to dominate the AI landscape. Companies like Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance have launched their own LLMs, aiming to capitalise on the growing demand for advanced AI solutions. Alibaba\u2019s decision to focus on enterprise customers has already shown results, with its Qwen models adopted by over 90,000 businesses since May.\n\nAnalysts predict these price cuts could reshape global AI accessibility, enabling smaller firms and startups to leverage cutting-edge technology. Lower costs may allow traditional industries to modernise operations, while venture capital flows into supporting technologies are expected to further fuel innovation.\n\nThe global AI race is poised to accelerate into 2025, with Chinese companies playing a central role in advancing machine reasoning and practical applications.

The cuts involve Alibaba\u2019s visual language model, Qwen-VL, created to perceive and understand both texts and images.\n\nThe report notes that the discounts illustrate the intensifying race among Chinese tech companies to capture new business for their artificial intelligence (AI) products.\n\nIn addition to Alibaba, tech giants like Tencent, Baidu, JD.com, Huawei and ByteDance have all introduced their own large language models (LLMs), AI models trained on massive amounts of data in an effort to generate human-like replies.\n\nBut unlike popular consumer AI models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Alibaba is focusing its LLM operations on enterprises, the report adds.\n\nIn Alibaba\u2019s case, the company is focusing its LLM efforts on the enterprise segment rather than launching a consumer AI chatbot like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. In May, Alibaba announced its Qwen models have been deployed by more than 90,000 enterprise customers.\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, Chinese companies\u2019 markdowns on AI models have reshaped the global artificial intelligence landscape.\n\n\u201cAs prices plummet, businesses worldwide could gain unprecedented access to advanced AI tools, potentially revolutionizing commerce across industries,\u201d that report said.\n\nExperts, PYMNTS added, argue the shift could democratize AI capabilities, letting smaller startups compete with massive tech companies, and allowing traditional businesses to overhaul their operations with state-of-the-art technology.\n\n\u201cWe will see significantly more competitiveness since much VC investment is going towards \u2018picks-and-shovels\u2019 AI technologies, and we should see more global pricing wars, which will be good,\u201d Nick Rioux, co-founder and CTO of AI company Labviva, told PYMNTS.\n\n\u201cWhen market forces impact technology innovation, we can create more use cases for a broader, more diverse set of applications. This is good and relatively unexpected when looking at how China has managed technological governance in the past.\u201d\n\nPYMNTS also explored AI efforts by Alibaba and other tech firms in a report Tuesday on the transformative year the technology has just experienced.\n\n\u201cThe drive for more capable systems continues into 2025,\u201d that report said. \u201cCompetition among tech giants has accelerated development, pushing boundaries in machine reasoning and practical applications.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOptimism for High Growth Despite High Rates and Debt\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump\u2019s policies take effect.\n\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed\u2019s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\n\nFed\u2019s Shifting Rate Path Sparks Concerns in the Market\n\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed\u2019s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn\u2019t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn\u2019t ruling out anything.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\n\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed\u2019s path forward.\n\nStory Continues",

However, in 2024, the company\u2019s transformative initiatives and resilience took center stage, solidifying its place as one of the powerhouses in sustainability, AI innovation, and e-commerce expansion.\n\n\n\nWith a laser-sharp focus on its core strategic pillars\u2014\u201cE-Commerce + AI\u201d\u2014Alibaba didn\u2019t reshape the landscape of commerce and technology; it flipped the script entirely, securing its spot as one of the most talked-about companies of the year.\n\nIf 2023 marked a year of recalibration, 2024 was Alibaba\u2019s resurgence. The company\u2019s knack for adapting to economic challenges and ever-shifting consumer behaviors showcased a relentless drive to innovate and push boundaries.\n\n#1: Breaking Barriers and Expanding Horizons\n\nIn late 2024, Alibaba formed a shiny new e-commerce business group, bundling together platforms like Taobao, Tmall, AliExpress, Alibaba.com, Lazada, Trendyol, 1688, and Idle Fish. This bold restructuring was designed to turbocharge global supply chains, empower SMEs, and give consumers a much more slicker experience.\n\n\n\nThe past year saw Alibaba\u2019s international expansion hit full throttle, racking up record-breaking growth in emerging markets. Thanks to hefty Investments in logistics and strategic partnerships, the company was perfectly poised to meet surging global demand while supporting small businesses. And those Q2 results revealed over 1 billion annual active consumers globally, reflecting its expanding user base and market impact.\n\nAlibaba.com reported rising optimism among SMEs worldwide as cross-border trade orders surged. The platform\u2019s cutting-edge digital tools and analytics positioned it as a linchpin in global trade. Meanwhile, AliExpress upped its game with new seller support programs like the \u201cPOP + Full Hosting\u201d model, making accommodating flexible operations easier and meeting diverse market needs. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget\u2014AliExpress scored big as the first exclusive e-commerce partner of UEFA Euro 2024, connecting with millions of football fans through tailored campaigns and exclusive merchandise.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba deepened its integration with mainland investors by debuting on HKEX Stock Connect, allowing investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade its shares directly. This strategic move further aligned Alibaba\u2019s global and domestic growth strategies, enhancing its investor base and market presence.\n\n#2: Shaping the Future of Consumer Behavior\n\nThe 2024 11.11 shopping festival wasn\u2019t just a sale, but redefined retail by merging commerce with entertainment. Since the event began, over 373 brands smashed 100 million yuan sales mark. The 88VIP member base has boosted cross-category spending, driving notable growth across beauty, apparel, and electronics, etc.\n\nInteractive features like live streaming made shopping a full-on experience, while trends like eco-friendly products and personalized offerings showcased a shift in consumer priorities. The festival highlighted emerging e-commerce technologies, such as AI-powered recommendations and AR shopping tools, raised the bar for the entire industry.\n\nAdditionally, Millennials and Gen Z are embracing lifestyle-centric products and cultural artifacts with open arms, which reflects a shift toward emotionally resonant consumer goods. Toys and IP products are no longer solely the domain of children; they have become emotional and cultural artifacts. In times of rising costs and tight budgets, these feel-good purchases bring comfort and joy.\n\n#3: Leading the AI Revolution and Cloud Services\n\n2024 was the year Alibaba fully embraced its inner tech wizard. With cutting-edge AI models, the company revolutionized business operations, from personalized shopping to predictive logistics, with its Tongyi model family supporting over 300,000 enterprises.\n\nRecently, Alibaba Cloud introduced its open-source AI reasoning model, QwQ, with jaw-dropping analytical capabilities, and ACE, a next-level image tool for creative tasks.\n\nAt the Apsara Conference 2024, Eddie Wu, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, gave a rousing call-to-action on AI\u2019s potential to boost productivity and bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. With Innovations like Qwen large models\u2014offering multimodal capabilities\u2014Alibaba made AI more accessible and affordable across industries. Meanwhile, advancements in robotics and autonomous driving hinted at the dawn of a new industrial era.\n\nJoe Tsai, Chairman of Alibaba Group, went all-in on AI, calling it a critical growth driver. The Qwen2.5 model\u2019s top ranking on Hugging Face exemplified Alibaba\u2019s leadership in open-source AI ecosystems. And with the ModelScope community hosting over 10,000 models, developers everywhere had plenty to cheer about.\n\nSpeaking of breakthroughs, Alibaba Cloud pulled off a record-breaking 500-petabyte data migration for Xiaohongshu, \u201cChina\u2019s Instagram\u201d, a project that\u2019s basically the digital equivalent of moving mountains. With a market share of 36% and partnership with heavyweights like Salesforce and IBM, Alibaba Cloud is owning the AI-driven data game.\n\n#4: Relentless Commitment to Sustainability\n\nAlibaba\u2019s 2024 ESG report was a mic-drop moment. The company slashed emissions by 15%, poured resources into afforestation, and transitioned to clean energy\u2014with 56% of Alibaba Cloud\u2019s self-built data centers now running on clean electricity. And its rural e-commerce initiatives and upskilling programs for underserved communities reflected a holistic approach to sustainable development.\n\nAt COP29, Alibaba demonstrated leadership by unveiling renewable energy initiatives and AI tools to help merchants reduce carbon emissions. Cainiao\u2019s green logistics\u2014featuring biodegradable packaging and electric delivery fleets\u2014set industry benchmarks.\n\nAdding to its accomplishments, Alibaba inaugurated its green-designed international headquarters. The facility integrates energy-efficient systems, smart lighting, and rainwater recycling, exemplifying its commitment to sustainability and innovation. Sustainability never looked so good.\n\n#5: Transforming Olympic Spectator Experiences\n\nAlibaba brought its A-game to the Paris 2024 Olympics, revolutionizing how fans experienced the event. For the first time, cloud computing, enabled by Alibaba Cloud, surpassed satellite technology as the go-to for broadcasting. This milestone expanded global access to live coverage while improving efficiency.\n\nAI-driven solutions made watching the Olympics more interactive than ever, offering real-time highlights, athlete analytics, and immersive AR replays. Behind the scenes, Alibaba\u2019s digital infrastructure streamlined everything from ticketing to logistics, setting new bar for international events.\n\n#6: Global Recognition for Social Impact\n\nAlibaba\u2019s efforts to protect intellectual property rights earned a big thumbs-up from the U.S. government in 2024. The company\u2019s tech-savvy approach to combating counterfeiting set a benchmark for trust in the digital space.\n\nMeanwhile, its AI-powered cancer detection tool also earned a spot on Fortune\u2019s 2024 Change the World list, transforming healthcare with enhanced diagnostic accuracy and accessibility for underserved populations. This success underscores Alibaba\u2019s dedication to using technology for good.\n\nDAMO Academy unveiled an AI-powered weather forecasting model that improves accuracy and supports disaster preparedness, agriculture, and energy management\u2014benefiting communities worldwide. Proof that Alibaba\u2019s tech is as good for society as it is for business.\n\nLooking Ahead\uff1a\u201cThe future is already here\u201d\n\nOver the years, DAMO Academy has consistently released its \u201cTop 10 Technology Trends of the Year.\u201d Today, we can clearly see the power of these predictions.\n\nFor example, in the report \u201c2023\u2019s Top 10 Tech Trends by Alibaba\u2019s DAMO Academy\u201d released on January 11, 2023, two of the trends highlighted have now become widely recognized. The first is Generative AI: Generative AI has entered an era of explosive applications, greatly advancing the production and creation of digital content. The second is Multimodal Pretrained Models: Multimodal pre-trained models, which unify knowledge representation across text, images, and audio, are becoming foundational infrastructure for artificial intelligence.\n\nAnother example is from the \u201cTop 10 Tech Trends of 2022,\u201d which included \u201cAI for Science\u201d and the \u201cCo-evolution of Large and Small Models.\u201d\n\nAs the renowned science fiction writer William Gibson once said, \u201cThe future is already here\u2014it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d This insight resonates deeply with the way these technology trends have unfolded, shaping the present in once unimaginable ways.\n\nThank you, as always, for reading.\n\n",

            "content": "Alibaba (BABA), a leading force in China\u2019s tech landscape, has announced substantial price reductions on its large language models (LLMs), slashing costs by up to 85%. This move, as reported by CNBC, was disclosed by Alibaba Cloud through a WeChat post, focusing specifically on their visual language model, Qwen-VL, which is adept at processing both text and images. Despite the significant announcement, Alibaba\u2019s stock is experiencing only a modest increase, rising 0.80% to $84.81 on the final trading day of the year in New York.\n\nThe price cuts reflect an aggressive strategy in the escalating competition among China\u2019s tech behemoths to capture the burgeoning market for AI technologies. Over the last 18 months, giants like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, JD.com, Huawei, and ByteDance (TikTok\u2019s parent company) have all ventured into developing their own LLMs, aiming to ride the wave of AI enthusiasm. Alibaba\u2019s decision to reduce prices is not unprecedented; the company previously cut prices by 55% in February on several core cloud products and dropped the cost of its Qwen AI model by up to 97% in May to stimulate market demand.\n\nLLMs are pivotal in the realm of artificial intelligence, serving as the foundation for generative AI systems. These models are trained on extensive datasets to produce responses that mimic human language, facilitating applications from customer service automation to content creation. Unlike some competitors who might focus more on consumer-facing AI like chatbots, Alibaba has strategically directed its LLM development towards enterprise solutions. This is evident from the deployment of its Qwen models by over 90,000 enterprise users as of May, highlighting Alibaba\u2019s intent to leverage AI in enhancing business operations, analytics, and customer interactions.\n\nThis pricing strategy could also be interpreted as a signal to the market about Alibaba\u2019s confidence in the scalability and adoption of AI within the enterprise sector. By making these models more affordable, Alibaba not only aims to increase penetration but also to foster an ecosystem where businesses of all sizes can utilize advanced AI without prohibitive costs. However, this aggressive pricing might also pressure competitors to follow suit, potentially leading to a broader price war that could redefine the economics of AI technology in China.\n\nFurthermore, this move comes at a time when global interest in AI, particularly in LLMs, is at an all-time high, driven by breakthroughs and applications like those seen with ChatGPT. Alibaba\u2019s focus on the enterprise market with its AI offerings positions it uniquely to tap into sectors where data security, efficiency, and customized solutions are paramount. As AI continues to evolve, the battle for dominance in this space will likely involve not just technology but also strategic pricing, partnerships, and innovation in model capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Alibaba\u2019s latest price reduction on its LLMs underscores a broader trend in the tech industry where affordability, accessibility, and enterprise relevance are becoming key battlegrounds. Whether this will lead to a sustainable business model or a race to the bottom in pricing remains to be seen, but for now, it clearly marks Alibaba\u2019s aggressive push to lead in China\u2019s AI landscape.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nFamously known as the \u201cgodfather of artificial intelligence\u201d, British-Canadian computer scientist Professor Geoffrey Hinton has recently warned that the pace of technological change today is much faster than was initially anticipated. As a result, there is a 10% to 20% chance that artificial intelligence will wipe out humanity within the next three decades. Previously, he had said there was only a 10% chance of technology doing so.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm\n\nDespite such warnings, companies are racing to lead the AI arms race. OpenAI, for instance, which is also known as the company that started the race itself, has recently outlined plans to revamp its structure. The company said that it would create a public benefit corporation so that it would make it easier to raise more capital.\n\nReuters reported the news back in September, which had sparked debate among corporate watchdogs and tech moguls regarding whether the company would be able to allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and whether the company would be able to strike a balance between making a profit and breeding public good as it develops AI.\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness. The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission\u201d.\n\nThe company plans to turn its for-profit branch into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC), aligning its structure with rivals such as Anthropic and Musk\u2019s xAI, which use a similar structure and have recently raised billions in funding.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business. This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "I was recently in China on yet another trip to tour the factories and showrooms of several leading micromobility companies, and I\u2019ll have more to share with you on that trip soon. But first, while I was getting ready to fly out of the Shanghai airport, I stumbled upon the coolest little motorized carry-on suitcase that functions like a seated electric scooter. I ended up buying it on the spot.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next when I tried to take it 8,000 km (5,000 miles) home.\n\nThis time it\u2019s for real\n\nThis is the real deal \u2013 I actually bought and tested this thing, which I can prove with my hilarious testing video filmed in three different international airports. I highly recommend it, if you\u2019ve got a couple minutes to burn.\n\nSo basically, you should know that this is not part of my long-running Awesomely Weird Alibaba Electric Vehicle of the Week series, where I (lovingly) poke fun at some of the odd and awesome EVs found on China\u2019s largest shopping site from the safety on my computer screen. I did happen to feature a motorized suitcase in my last post in the Alibaba series, inspired by the fact that I knew I\u2019d be sharing this review with you all soon. And finally, here we are!\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nI\u2019ve seen these motorized suitcases floating around the interwebs for some time, but they\u2019ve always been frustratingly expensive. For more than the price of a great e-bike, you can buy one of these motorized suitcase scooters. Since I wasn\u2019t about to drop nearly $900 on a contraption like this, I figured I\u2019d never have the pleasure of experiencing one.\n\nThat was until I walked past a shop selling them in the Shanghai airport. I was able to snag it for just 3,000 RMB, or the equivalent of around US $411. It\u2019s still a dumb price, but it\u2019s over half off the going rate in the west.\n\nThese sales ladies know a sucker when they see one!\n\nHow does a motorized suitcase scooter work?\n\nThis thing is actually a decent rolling suitcase to begin with. It has 26L of storage, large rear rolling wheels, and a solid telescoping handle so you can roll it around like a normal trolley bag.\n\nBut when you push the expansion toggle switch the rear, the scooter\u2019s frame extends out of the bottom and you can telescope up the handlebars to turn it into a functional scooter. A little pad tucked under the carry handle serves as a diminutive seat, and the right thumb lever on the handlebars is pressed to activate the electric motor in the single front wheel. The left thumb lever is the brake (just electric motor braking, no physical brakes), and you can engage reverse by holding both thumb levers simultaneously.\n\nFor something designed to do two things at once, which is normally a recipe for mediocrity at both, it actually surprised me in a good way. The suitcase works fine, even if you lose some of its interior storage that is taken up by the scooter\u2019s frame. You also get the nice feature of the suitcase\u2019s battery functioning like a USB power bank, so that\u2019s another cool feature. And as a scooter, it\u2019s decently comfortable, though a bit cramped.\n\nI will say that the zipper on the bag feels a bit cheap and seems to me like it could be the first thing that will eventually break, rendering the bag useless for carrying anything, but until then it works pretty well at its job.\n\nHow good can a motorized suitcase scooter be?\n\nThis specific suitcase is the Airwheel SE3S, and the marketing says it can get up to 13 km/h (8 mph). My journey home from China started in Shanghai, where for the first couple kilometers of scooting, I didn\u2019t realize I only had the suitcase in the middle power mode and not its highest setting.\n\nI still had a lot of fun scooting around the airport and I was even going faster than folks walking on the moving walkways, so the middle gear was still plenty fast.\n\nBut after arriving at my connection in Abu Dhabi, I downloaded the smartphone app and discovered that I could fully unlock the speed. At that point, I was using every single one of those 300 watts available in the front motor to rocket me up to 13 km/h. In fact, I was going so fast that when I would hit the metal expansion joints in the airport floor, the little 92 Wh battery would bounce up off of its connector and I\u2019d momentarily lose power. I could reach behind me and push the battery back down, then all was good again. And it really only happened in the highest power mode, which is when I\u2019d hit any bumps with the most force.\n\nBut keep in mind that that if you hit any bumps at full speed, you might have to deal with momentary power interruptions. Not ideal, but still better than the trolley bag that I\u2019d have to pull instead of this one pulling me!\n\nTo be frank, I\u2019m actually amazed that the thing was pulling 300W through that little barrel connector (easier to see in the video).\n\nBut it never felt like anything was heating up too much, so I guess they have spec\u2019d some sufficiently capable copper and enough heat dissipation on either side to make it work. Or it\u2019s not really pulling 300W, which would make sense since how much power does one really need to go 13 km/h on a flat airport floor?\n\nI also found other features that were available in the app, such as changing the color of the LED lighting in the scooter and controlling the suitcase remotely from my phone. The latter was pretty funny to test out \u2013 imagine pushing a button on your phone and watching your suitcase drive away.\n\nBoth seem like novelties, so I didn\u2019t really mess with those features very much in practice.\n\nI could see in the app that by this point I had scooted around 3 km (nearly 2 miles) in the Shanghai and Abu Dhabi airports, which was a weird statistic to have for a suitcase, but I was pretty proud of it.\n\nCan you legally fly with an electric motorized suitcase?\n\nI never once had an issue with the bag, though it did get pulled off to the side for additional screening in Abu Dhabi. The battery had already been removed, but it went it got pulled off into the lane of shame after the X-ray scan anyway.\n\nThat when a big UAE dude in military fatigues carried my scootcase over to the inspection counter, took one look at the computer screen with its scan on it, and told me it was good to go. No extra inspection. I popped the battery back in and rode away, as one does in these situations.\n\nWith a 92 Wh battery that neatly fits under the 100 Wh limit used by most airlines for lithium-ion batteries in carry-on bags, there\u2019s really nothing else that would disqualify this as a legal carry-on bag in most cases. There are some airlines that have specifically banned hoverboards and other rideables, so you may want to double check, but I had no issue in three international airports.\n\nBut the journey wasn\u2019t over yet\n\nThe final leg of my journey was a flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv, and the Airwheel suitcase performed admirably yet again. It fit just fine in the overhead storage compartment and was ready to rock n\u2019 roll as soon as I was off the plane.\n\nIn fact, just because Ben Gurion Airport was my final stop, that didn\u2019t mean I was done scooting. I took the train from the airport to a stop around 2 km (1.2 miles) from my apartment, then tried to ride my suitcase the rest of the way home. I probably could have made it since the battery is rated for around 8 km (5 mi) per charge, but it just felt pretty darn slow. So I put it on a Lime scooter and rode the pair of us most of the rest of the way at a much peppier 25 km/h (15 mph).\n\nClose to home, I switched back to my suitcase so I could ride the last few hundred meters in style. And to finish strong, I was able to ride it right up the handicap accessible ramp into the lobby of my building, into the elevator, back out of the elevator (in reverse, mind you), and right up to my apartment door.\n\nI had successfully ridden the suitcase from a Shanghai airport shop to my living room, albeit with a few planes, a train, and a Lime scooter in between.\n\nWhat\u2019s the verdict?\n\nAt just over US $400, I can barely justify this thing, at least for me. Yes, it actually worked great and was super fun, but I\u2019m not exactly the target market.\n\nFor someone who has trouble walking long distances in an airport, this would definitely be a better way to get around.\n\nBut at the Amazon price of nearly US $900, it\u2019s hard for me to call this a \u201cbuy\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I had a blast on it and don\u2019t regret it, even if I\u2019m probably going to try to sell it used for close to what I bought it for and recoup my investment in this article and video. But I\u2019m not sure I can tell anyone it\u2019s really worth the Amazon MSRP, for the same reason that I never considered buying one myself until I found it for under half-priced directly from its Chinese source. In fact, now I\u2019m wondering what it would cost on the streets of China if I hadn\u2019t paid the presumed airport markup.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll need to go back to China and find out\u2026",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm\u2019s focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA)\n\n10-Year Revenue CAGR: 31.26%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 115\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) is a leading technology company that operates a diverse portfolio of businesses, including e-commerce platforms, cloud computing services, digital media, and entertainment. It plays a significant role in the Chinese economy and impacts businesses and consumers worldwide.\n\nIn FQ2 2025, the company demonstrated continued growth, with revenue increasing by 7% year-over-year, driven by a double-digit expansion in public cloud revenue, a key segment within its Cloud Intelligence Group. The Cloud Intelligence Group, which focuses on cloud computing and AI services, generated RMB 29.6 billion ($4.2 billion) in revenue during FQ2 2025. Notably, AI-related products within this segment achieved triple-digit year-over-year growth for the 5th consecutive quarter.\n\nRecognizing the immense potential of AI, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) plans to significantly invest in AI infrastructure to further solidify its position as a leading provider of AI-powered cloud solutions.\n\nIn its Q3 2024 investor letter, Conventum \u2013 Alluvium Global Fund highlighted the significant outperformance of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) driven by China\u2019s recent stimulus package, while acknowledging the potential risks associated with its current valuation. Here\u2019s what it stated:\n\n\u201cOn 24 September the People\u2019s Bank of China unveiled a massive three part stimulus package involving: (1) slashing the amount of cash banks need to hold in reserve and lowering the main policy interest rate; (2) cutting mortgage rates on existing home loans by 0.5% and reducing down payment requirements for second homes from 25% to 15%; and (3) supporting equity markets by a USD 114b lending pool to encourage companies to buy back shares and non-bank financial institutions to buy local equities (which may be expanded by the same amount two more times)5 . We are flabbergasted. But we shouldn\u2019t be. After all, these types of arrangements have been all too common over the last 15 years. The local equity markets responded with gusto, and for the last week of the quarter the CSI 300 Index (Shanghai and Shenzen listed companies) was up 25.1%. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was not lost in all this, and returned 26.8% over that one week period. But Alibaba had already performed well so during the whole September quarter it was up a staggering 56.0%. As a result, Alibaba is no longer the cheap stock it once was. It now trades at a premium to our valuation \u2013 a valuation which admittedly had been progressively reduced over our holding period as a result of deteriorating business fundamentals. As a result of Alibaba\u2019s significant outperformance, by the end of the quarter it had reached 3.7% of the Fund. We are weighing up our options here, considering the relative risk.\u201d\n\nOverall BABA ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

ByteDance\u2019s US$11 billion in capex is still well below the US$44.5 billion spent by Microsoft alone, according to the research note.\n\nDoubao, a conversational bot developed by ByteDance, is pictured on a smartphone in Beijing on November 12, 2024.
