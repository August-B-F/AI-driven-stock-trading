Let's examine why.\n\nAdding to a collection of strong businesses\n\nThe acquisition of Wiz adds yet another strong business to Alphabet. While best known for its Google search engine, Alphabet actually has a strong collection of market-leading and emerging businesses. It's the leading digital advertiser in the world, where it not only serves ads for Google, but for its other properties and third-party sites as well.\n\nIts YouTube streaming service is the most watched streaming platform in the U.S. and the fourth-largest digital advertising platform in the world. It owns the world's third-largest cloud computing company in Google Cloud, which has been its fastest-growing segment. It has also taken leading positions in emerging technologies such as quantum computing and autonomous driving with its Waymo unit.\n\nWiz only adds to Alphabet's collection of leading tech businesses and further highlights that Alphabet is much more than search. In addition, it is purchasing a fast-growing company in a booming field.\n\nWiz is a leader in cloud detection and response (CDR) security, where its Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) uses artificial intelligence (AI) to quickly scan and identify vulnerabilities across the cloud environment. Its platform connects to every cloud environment and covers every aspect of cloud security.\n\nIt's also been developing new products as it continues to innovate. Two launched in the past year include a code-to-cloud security solution called Wiz Code, and a detection and response solution for SecOps (security operation) teams called Wiz Defend. This should help the company grow with its existing customer base over time as it adds more solution modules.\n\nWiz counts the three biggest cloud computing companies -- Google Cloud, Amazon's AWS, and Microsoft's Azure -- among its customers, as well as half of the Fortune 100. Large enterprise customers include Morgan Stanley, BMW, and LVMH.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Wiz will continue to partner with all cloud computing companies. However, owning Wiz should be a big boost to Alphabet's Google Cloud unit. It will strengthen Google Cloud's security offerings and should help differentiate it from the competition. Meanwhile, Alphabet will be able to sell Wiz's products into its large base of Google Cloud customers, as well.\n\nGoogle Cloud has been Alphabet's fastest-growing segment, with revenue climbing 30% last quarter and segment operating income soaring 142%. Wiz should only increase the attractiveness of its cloud offering, given its strong reputation as a cloud cybersecurity provider. Cybersecurity threats are not slowing, and with the growth of cloud computing and AI, this deal helps set Alphabet apart.\n\nTime to buy the stock\n\nThe Wiz deal, assuming it closes, will be the largest in Alphabet's history. It's paying a hefty price tag believed to be around 60 times Wiz's 2024 annual recurring revenue of $500 million in 2024. However, Wiz has a very strong platform that is growing quickly, and Alphabet should be able to accelerate growth given its large installed Google Cloud customer base.\n\nThe deal should also help make Google Cloud more attractive to potential enterprise customers. This could help bolster growth not just from selling Wiz solutions, but from attracting new customers to Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet has done very well with acquisitions in the past, most notably with YouTube, which it acquired in 2006 for $1.65 billion. At the time, YouTube was an unprofitable start-up facing copyright concerns. It was also Alphabet's largest-ever acquisition when the deal closed. Last quarter alone, YouTube generated $10.5 billion in revenue.\n\nTogether with its early acquisition of cybersecurity company Mandiant, a leading cyber threat intelligence company, Alphabet is creating a world-class cybersecurity business. This just adds another growth lever to the company.\n\nGiven its growing array of top-notch businesses, Alphabet's stock is just way too cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 18 times 2025 analysts' estimates.\n\nAlphabet looks like a great buy at current levels, and once the dust from the market sell-off clears, investors should start to realize the extremely valuable set of assets the company has collected. The Wiz acquisition just adds to these strong businesses and should be a big growth driver in the years ahead.",

            "content": "The latest trading session saw Alphabet (GOOGL) ending at $162.80, denoting a -0.67% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.22%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.03%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.33%.\n\nShares of the internet search leader have depreciated by 11.54% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 12% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 7.48%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Alphabet to post earnings of $2.02 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 6.88%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $75.65 billion, up 11.92% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $8.90 per share and revenue of $330.07 billion, indicating changes of +10.7% and +11.84%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher. As of now, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.41 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.73, so one might conclude that Alphabet is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nIt's also important to note that GOOGL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.18. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. GOOGL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.3 as of yesterday's close.",

            "content": "Despite rising competitive threats, Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) is still investors best bet when it comes to artificial intelligence-enabled (AI) search engines, says a top Wall Street analyst.\n\nMark Kelley, a five-star rated analyst at investment bank Stifel Financial (SF), says that concerns Alphabet\u2019s dominance in online search is under threat are overblown and that the company remains \u201cbest positioned in the AI agent arena, with its Gemini Advanced product capable of handling queries in a conversational manner.\u201d\n\nKelley also noted that Alphabet should continue to benefit from the \u201chousehold nature of the Google brand.\u201d Some analysts and investors have been wringing their hands lately over concerns that Google could lose its title as the king of search due to a number of new AI upstarts in the search engine arena.\n\nBuy Rating\n\nKelley rates GOOGL stock a Buy with a $225 price target, which is nearly 40% above where the shares are currently trading. The analyst highlighted several recent AI advancements from Alphabet that should help keep it ahead of the pack for the foreseeable future.\n\nThese include \u201cProject Mariner,\u201d which can help users complete tasks on their computer in real time, and \u201cJules,\u201d a coding agent, which is meant to help coders handle bug fixes and other tasks in real time. Through its Google Cloud unit, Alphabet also offers the \u201cVertex AI Agent Builder\u201d that is meant to be used to create AI agents and applications.\n\nGOOGL stock has declined 14% so far this year.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Alphabet has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 36 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 25 Buy and 11 Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average GOOGL price target of $215.33 implies 32.47% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on GOOGL stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Alphabet is leveraging AI to attract new clients, win larger deals and deepen product adoption among existing customers. GOOGL\u2019s Gemini models, along with Generative AI (Gen AI) video and image generation models, Veo 2 and Imagen 2, are currently used by more than 4.4 billion developers across products and platforms.\n\nWe believe the addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud computing space.\n\nAlphabet shares have declined 15.1% year to date due to sluggish cloud growth and higher investments. GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online in 2025, cloud revenues are expected to see increased variability. The company now expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which is aimed at building up technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.\n\nHowever, the acquisition news seemed less palatable to investors as GOOGL shares fell 2.2% to close at $160.67 on Tuesday, which was an overreaction in our view. Although the buyout price is quite lofty, given GOOGL\u2019s strong cash balance of $95.68 billion, it should provide some relief to investors.\n\nThe $32 billion deal is the largest in Alphabet\u2019s history and is much higher than the $6.1 billion GOOGL spent on cybersecurity provider Mandiant in 2022. The Wiz buyout reflects the growing importance of Google Cloud in the company\u2019s growth plans. The segment accounted for 12.4% of total revenues in 2024, growing 30.6% over 2023, better than the 26% growth it registered in 2023 over 2022.\n\nAlphabet is set to acquire Wiz for a whopping $32 billion in a deal that will enhance Google Cloud\u2019s security offerings. The Google-Wiz combination will offer security offerings that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently. Wiz has a stellar clientele with its cloud security platform currently used by Amazon , Microsoft and Oracle .\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 20, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLast week, Alphabet introduced new and upgraded features to Gemini users, including Deep Research on 2.0 Flash Thinking, Gems, apps and personalization. The 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model supports file upload and is much more efficient and speedier. GOOGL upgraded Deep Research with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, which enhances Gemini\u2019s capabilities across all \u201cresearch stages \u2014 from planning and searching to reasoning, analyzing and reporting \u2014 creating higher-quality, multi-page reports that are more detailed and insightful.\u201d\n\nAlphabet is promoting Gemini as a personal AI-powered assistant with the addition of a new and experimental capability called personalization, powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. The personalization feature connects Gemini with Google apps and services, including Search, enabling the model to deliver appropriate responses. GOOGL is now making Gemini available to mobile users, replacing the classic Google Assistant.\n\nAI is powering Search. Circle to Search is driving additional Search and is gaining popularity among younger users. Vertex usage increased 20 times in 2024, with strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3 and Veo. GOOGL recently launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or TPU.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Show Steady Trend for GOOGL\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $2.02 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 6.88% year-over-year growth.\n\nThe consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.90 per share, steady over the past 30 days, suggesting 10.7% year-over-year growth.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.57%.\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc.

GOOGL\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market and strong position in the cloud are long-term drivers.\n\nAlphabet is facing increasing regulatory headwinds and global scrutiny over its search dominance. Google\u2019s alleged wrong practices constitute the utilization of Android to promote its own search engine unfairly. It is facing several lawsuits regarding data privacy, competition practices, AI usage and copyright issues in several countries across the globe.\n\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

            "content": "Alphabet recently experienced a 2.05% decline in its share price over the last week. This period was marked by significant developments for the company, including ongoing discussions about acquiring Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, Inc. for over $30 billion. The sizable proposed deal, amid persistent antitrust concerns, fuels considerable market interest as it could substantially impact Alphabet\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, Alphabet\u2019s new partnership with NVIDIA aims to advance AI development across several industries, potentially enhancing its technological leadership. Despite these strategic endeavors, the overall market moved higher with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both posting gains, influenced by anticipation of economic insights from the Federal Reserve. The contrasting market environment, with strong performances by other tech giants like Tesla and Boeing, might have overshadowed Alphabet\u2019s news, contributing to the company's slight price dip over the week.\n\nBuy, Hold or Sell Alphabet?

Key contributors to this performance include the company's steady earnings growth, with a five-year annualized increase of 17.7%. Alphabet's robust earnings, including a 35.7% rise last year, have enhanced its financial strength and appeal. As a value proposition, it trades significantly below its estimated fair value, suggesting investor confidence in future prospects.\n\nAlphabet's initiatives, such as share repurchases exceeding US$37.29 billion since April 2024, have supported long-term shareholder returns. Significant collaborations, like those with NVIDIA in AI technologies, continue to position the company at the forefront of industry innovation. However, over the past year, Alphabet's performance lagged behind the Interactive Media and Services industry, returning less than the industry's 11.7%, despite outpacing the broader US market's 8.1% return during the same period, reflecting the competitive challenges in its sector.\n\nEvaluate Alphabet's prospects by accessing our earnings growth report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google's subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products such as Chromecast). Google's cloud computing platform, or GCP, accounts for roughly 10% of Alphabet's revenue with the firm's investments in up-and-coming technologies such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber) making up the rest.\n\nAlphabet: Delving into Financials\n\nMarket Capitalization Analysis: With an elevated market capitalization, the company stands out above industry averages, showcasing substantial size and market acknowledgment.\n\nRevenue Growth: Alphabet displayed positive results in 3 months. As of 31 December, 2024, the company achieved a solid revenue growth rate of approximately 11.77%. This indicates a notable increase in the company's top-line earnings. In comparison to its industry peers, the company trails behind with a growth rate lower than the average among peers in the Communication Services sector.\n\nNet Margin: Alphabet's net margin surpasses industry standards, highlighting the company's exceptional financial performance. With an impressive 27.51% net margin, the company effectively manages costs and achieves strong profitability.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE): Alphabet's financial strength is reflected in its exceptional ROE, which exceeds industry averages. With a remarkable ROE of 8.3%, the company showcases efficient use of equity capital and strong financial health.\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA): Alphabet's ROA stands out, surpassing industry averages. With an impressive ROA of 6.03%, the company demonstrates effective utilization of assets and strong financial performance.\n\nDebt Management: Alphabet's debt-to-equity ratio is below the industry average at 0.08, reflecting a lower dependency on debt financing and a more conservative financial approach.\n\nWhat Are Analyst Ratings?\n\nAnalysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter.\n\nSome analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.\n\nBreaking: Wall Street's Next Big Mover\n\nBenzinga's #1 analyst just identified a stock poised for explosive growth.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Google has struck a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition at the same time it\u2019s facing a potential breakup of its internet empire.\n\nThe proposed takeover announced Tuesday is part of Google\u2019s aggressive expansion into cloud computing during an artificial intelligence boom. The frenzy is driving demand for data centers that provide the computing power for AI technology and intensifying the competition in that space among Google and two other tech powerhouses, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nIf the all-cash transaction is approved by regulators, Wiz will join Google Cloud \u2014 an increasingly important part of its business separate from the search and advertising operations that account for most of the $350 billion annual revenue at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.\n\nWith the advent of AI, however, the cloud division has become a rising star at Google. Annual revenue in the division was $26.3 billion in 2022, and soared 64% to $43.2 billion last year.\n\nWiz, a five-year-old startup founded by four longtime friends who met in the Israeli army when they were still teenagers, is on track for an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. After getting its start in Israel in 2020, Wiz now oversees an operation that makes security tools protecting the information stored in data centers from its current headquarters in New York.\n\n\u201cWiz and Google Cloud are both fueled by the belief that cloud security needs to be easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and democratized, so more organizations can adopt and use cloud and AI securely,\u201d Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote in a blog post.\n\nIn a Tuesday conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted Cloud division\u2019s addition of Wiz will result in even better security at a lower cost than can be provided now. That prediction may have been aimed as much at regulators likely to scrutinize how the deal will affect competition and pricing, as much as at prospective customers.\n\nGoogle had been courting Wiz for some time before finally settling on a price that\u2019s much richer than a reported $23 billion bid that was rejected last July. At that time, Wiz signaled it would instead pivot back to a previously-planned initial public offering. But recent volatility in the stock market has chilled the IPO market, and now Rappaport said Wiz expects to \u201cinnovate even faster\u201d by becoming a part of Google.\n\nWedbush analysts called Google\u2019s move to buy Wiz \u201ca shot across the bow\u201d at other tech giants, particularly Microsoft and Amazon, who have already made big bets on cyber security as the fight to dominate cloud computing intensifies. Google had fallen behind its competition in the cloud space, Wedbush said, but the acquisition of Wiz could alter the parameters.\n\nThe bid Tuesday easily eclipses the current largest acquisition in Google\u2019s 26-year history \u2014 a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012 that didn\u2019t pay off the way that the Mountain View, California, company had hoped. The $32 billion purchase of Wiz would also go down as the biggest-ever cybersecurity acquisition and rank among the 20 most expensive takeovers of a software company in history, according to Mergermarket, a financial intelligence service.\n\nAs often happens with high-priced acquisitions, investors reacted coolly to Tuesday\u2019s news. Alphabet\u2019s shares declined 2% to close at $160.67.\n\nSome of Google\u2019s other acquisitions have turned into gold mines, most notably its $1.76 billion purchase of online video pioneer YouTube in 2006 and its $3.1 billion takeover of advertising technology platform DoubleClick in 2008. A $5.4 billion purchase of another security firm, Mandiant, in 2022 also helped fuel the recent growth of Google\u2019s Cloud division, which posted an operating profit of $6.1 billion last year.\n\nGoogle\u2019s DoubleClick deal is now part of an antitrust case filed by the U.S. Justice Department targeting Google\u2019s technology for distributing ads across the internet. A ruling in that case, involving allegations that Google illegally abused its power to manipulate digital ad prices, is expected this year.\n\nRegulators in the U.S. and abroad are targeting Google on other fronts, too.\n\nLast year, a federal judge in another case brought by the Justice Department last year concluded Google had turned its ubiquitous search engine into an illegal monopoly. The penalization phase of that trial begins next month.\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking a rebuke that would include a requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser and would ban the company from making agreements with Apple and other companies to make its search engine the default tool for finding online information on the iPhone and other devices.\n\nThe Wiz deal will also get a close look from antitrust regulators. While many expect the Trump administration to welcome more dealmaking than occurred during the previous years, it has also expressed leeriness about Big Tech getting any bigger. Andrew Ferguson, the Trump administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission Chairman, has been particularly outspoken about his resolve to keep Big Tech on a short leash.\n\nThe deal raises antitrust concerns due to the potential impact on standalone cyber security vendors, as well as potential disruption for bigger rivals. Still, Wedbush\u2019s analysts note the industry is \u201cripe for consolidation\u201d \u2014 which could pose \u201cmassive growth opportunities on the horizon heading into this AI Revolution.\u201d\n\nAntitrust worries were also believed among the reasons Wiz called off sales talks with Google last year while President Joe Biden\u2019s administration was seeking to block a variety of tech deals. Agreeing to a sale now indicates both Google and Wiz are more confident the deal will gain U.S. approval under the Trump administration, Mergermarket analysts Kevin Ketcham and Kevin McCaffrey wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\n\u201cThe two sides likely wouldn\u2019t have struck the deal if they didn\u2019t at least see a potential path to closing,\u201d Ketcham and McCaffrey wrote.\n\nBut the business watchdog group Demand Progress Education Fund urged the Trump administration to block Google\u2019s takeover attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s time to show the public whether they have the guts to step in and stop a big fish from being gobbled up by one of the biggest fishes in the pond,\u201d said Emily Peterson-Cassin, the group\u2019s director of corporate power.\n\nIf they get the regulatory greenlight and meet several conditions spelled out in their agreement, Google and Wiz expect the deal to close in 2026.\n\n_______\n\nGrantham-Philips reported from New York.",

We plan to extend both the chip\u2019s range and capacity by creating an iteration with thousands of emitters.\u201d\n\nAfrica deployments\n\nSo far, Taara says it has deployed hundreds of optical links in more than a dozen countries, including Kenya, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delivering commercial service in partnership with Airtel, Liquid Intelligent Technologies and Liberty Networks, as well as pioneering new approaches to wireless optical communications deployments with the likes of T-Mobile and Vodafone,\u201d reported Krishnaswamy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working with innovators and researchers to explore new applications for our recently launched silicon photonic chip.\u201d\n\nWhile several companies have attempted to commercialize free-space optics for high-speed connectivity in the past, the cost of the technology and the challenge of maintaining reliable optical links in bad weather saw it lose out to more conventional approaches.\n\nThe recent exception to that has been in space, where lasers are now being used to send large datasets - for example high-resolution and multispectral Earth imagery - between orbiting and geostationary satellites, and even to ground stations.\n\nAside from Taara, the free-space optics approach is also being pursued by Aalyria, a Silicon Valley company that has been working with Singapore-based investment group HICO to establish a first-of-a-kind 'marine internet' by deploying up to 200 free-space optical links providing high-speed connectivity for the shipping industry.",

Alphabet showed interest in acquiring the company last year at a lower price, according to reports. Dealogic said that a $32 billion takeover of Wiz would mark the largest ever transaction by Alphabet, well over the previous number one: its $13 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility more than a decade ago.\n\n\n\nIn a note based on reports of a pending deal Monday, Oppenheimer analysts said that having Wiz will allow Google to be \u201cthe leading vendor in the cloud security space and a top 10 vendor in security.\u201d They added that with the addition of Wiz, Google moves from \u201dpartner to direct competitor\u201d for Palo Alto Networks Inc.

            "content": "The future of Google's parent company's looks murkier than ever.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG -0.63%) (GOOGL -0.72%) is often considered a reliable blue chip tech stock. It owns Google, the world's most widely used search engine; Android, the largest mobile operating system; Chrome, which dominates the web browser market; and YouTube, the top streaming video platform with over 2.7 billion monthly active users. It also provides a broad range of market-leading cloud-based productivity and infrastructure services.\n\nOver the past decade, Alphabet's stock rallied nearly 480% as its digital advertising and cloud businesses expanded. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% as its EPS increased at a CAGR of 23%.\n\nBut today, Alphabet's core advertising business, which generated 76% of its revenue in 2024, faces three existential challenges. First, generative artificial (AI) platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT are changing how people search for information. Second, short video platforms like ByteDance's TikTok and Meta Platforms' Reels are pulling advertisers and viewers away from YouTube's longer-format videos. Lastly, U.S. antitrust regulators are pressing Alphabet to sell Chrome or Android.\n\nSome investors might be wondering if Alphabet is doomed to become the next IBM, which lost the PC and enterprise software markets to its nimbler competitors over the past four decades. But is that a fair comparison, or is it just a bearish hyperbole which overlooks the actual differences between Alphabet and IBM?\n\nIBM's biggest mistakes\n\nIBM dominated the personal computing market in the 1980s and early 1990s, but it didn't actually own the IP to any of the off-the-shelf components in its PCs. As a result, other PC makers produced cheaper \"IBM PC clones\" with the same hardware. IBM tried to differentiate itself from those clones with its own operating system, OS/2, but that effort flopped as Microsoft Windows became the dominant OS for IBM PC clones.\n\nThose failures forced IBM to back away from the PC market, and it eventually sold its ThinkPad PC business to Lenovo in 2005. It also sold its server business to Lenovo in 2014. That retreat shows how a company's core growth engine can wither if its moat dries up and it fails to keep up with its nimbler competitors.\n\nBy the late 2000s and early 2010s, IBM was struggling to expand its aging enterprise software and IT services divisions against cloud-based competitors like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google. But instead of aggressively investing in new cloud services and transforming its on-premise software and services into cloud-based ones, IBM focused on divesting its weaker units, cutting costs, and buying back more shares to boost its EPS.\n\nBy the time IBM tried to expand its cloud business by acquiring SoftLayer in 2013, it had already far fallen behind Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Its fortunes didn't improve until 2020, when its cloud chief Arvind Krishna took the helm as its new CEO, divested its struggling infrastructure services business, and leveraged its acquisition of RedHat (in 2019) to expand its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses.\n\nIs Alphabet headed down the same road?\n\nThe bears expect Alphabet to face the same fate as IBM as generative AI platforms intercept more search queries and reduce the effectiveness of its search engine and targeted ads. Google is trying to catch up with its own generative AI platform, Gemini, but it could still end up as the OS/2 of the AI market if it falls behind ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot.\n\nMoreover, Android is still an open-source OS which can be modified by anyone. That makes it easy for companies like Amazon to launch their own forked versions of Android (Fire OS) and build their own app-driven ecosystems. Google's cloud platform business is still growing, but it ranks a distant third in the cloud race behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube -- which drives a lot of its advertising growth -- doesn't have a meaningful moat against TikTok or Reels. Its top creators can easily cross-post their content to those rival platforms, and they'll likely shuffle toward the one which gives them the biggest cut of their ad revenues. YouTube is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its subscriptions business, but that strategic shift strongly suggests the growth of its advertising business will cool off over the next few years.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) could further erode Google's defenses by forcing it to sell Chrome, which gathers data from its users for its core advertising business; and Android, which locks 2.5 billion users into its Google-powered apps.\n\nLike the old IBM, Alphabet is trying to offset that pressure by pruning its workforce, cutting costs, and buying back 11% of its shares over the past five years. However, its future could remain murky if it fails to keep pace with the shift toward AI services.\n\nAlphabet isn't becoming the old IBM (yet)\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss Alphabet as the next IBM, but it's still growing a lot faster than Big Blue. Its expansion efforts have been undeniably clumsy, but they could still bear fruit over the next few years. I'd keep a close eye on its recent challenges, but I wouldn't rule out a surprising comeback once it finally gets its act together.",

            "content": "Don't make it complicated. Sometimes the most obvious picks truly are your top prospects.\n\nIf you've been an investor for a while, you've likely heard Warren Buffett's advice: \"You can't buy what is popular and do well.\" And his point is well taken. Plenty of stocks are overvalued simply because everyone seems willing to pay a premium price to own them.\n\nDon't be so committed to a general tip, however, that you look right past a solid wealth-building prospect staring you right in the face. Sometimes, the highest-odds wealth builders are its most obvious stocks.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a closer look at three no-brainer ideas that may not create fireworks but are surefire market leaders with the potential to make good forward progress for a long, long time.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nYou know the company. Walmart (WMT 1.01%) is, of course, the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, operating nearly 11,000 locales worldwide, with more than 5,000 of these stores in the United States alone (when counting its Sam's Club warehouses). Indeed, 90% of U.S. residents live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. It also operates the country's second-biggest e-commerce platform, behind Amazon.\n\nThe retailer hasn't always used its powerful name and reach all that well. It arguably got complacent with its growth between the 1980s through the early 2000s, not recognizing the threat that Amazon was becoming while at the same time just failing to remain competitive. You may recall horror stories from a decade ago about Walmart's habitually empty store shelves, for instance.\n\nPutting CEO Doug McMillon in charge back in 2014, however, jump-started a long-needed evolution. Not only did the company finally start taking e-commerce seriously shortly thereafter, but McMillon started what could be considered a cultural revolution for the retailer. That's when Walmart became more than just a place to buy a range of consumer staples at a good price. It became a lifestyle company, offering once-unlikely goods like private-label premium wine and plant-based ice cream. It's operating a handful of veterinarian clinics, too, and offers technology installation services akin to Best Buy's Geek Squad. In-store shoppers will also notice store displays that look like something you'd expect to see at a traditional department store such as Macy's or JCPenney. It even manages a subscription-based delivery service that's competitive with Amazon Prime.\n\nAnd all of these initiatives have mattered. Although boosted by a combination of inflation and the sheer difficulty of going through the COVID-19 pandemic, most of Walmart's market share growth since 2022 has come from residents of households earning more than $100,000 per year. Yet, the backdrop hasn't necessarily prevented Walmart's other customers from continuing to shop with the retailer. Conversely, rival Target -- once a frequent destination for these six-figure consumers -- has seen its sales stagnate since 2023.\n\nMore important to interested investors, this new pragmatic consumer norm paired with Walmart's willingness to evolve is likely here to stay for at least one full generation of shoppers. Maybe more.\n\n2. Apple\n\nIt's another name that doesn't need much in the way of an introduction or explanation. Not only is Apple (AAPL 1.82%) considered the world's most valuable brand name, but it's also the world's biggest company as measured by market cap. That's what happens when you make the world's most popular smartphone -- the iPhone.\n\nApple is more than just the iPhone, of course, which only accounts for about half of its current revenue. Indeed, being the name behind the world's most beloved smartphone hasn't helped much for a while now. iPhone sales -- revenue as well as units -- haven't really grown since 2021.\n\nThere's a reason, however, that Apple shares have continued to climb since coming out of 2022's bear market. That is, this is Apple! It's the world's biggest and best-loved company for a reason. Any iPhone slowdown is apt to only be a temporary headwind while it's working on its next revolutionary growth engines.\n\nArtificial intelligence is one of these engines. Although interest in its Apple Intelligence platform, which launched in October, has been modest, that's not an indictment of the quality of the tool. This is an indication that consumers just need a bit more time and education before they fully embrace the power of personalized AI, while Apple itself needs to further refine its solution.\n\nIt's still coming, though. Analysts at Jeffries don't see Apple's AI efforts measurably paying off until 2026 or 2027, but once it starts, Wedbush's Dan Ives believes we'll see \"a multiyear upgrade cycle that will result in a supercycle and ultimately drive iPhone growth toward the high single digits.\"\n\nIn the meantime, it's encouraging that Apple is finally thinking outside the box by looking outside of its own product/service ecosystem. While last month's decision to make the Apple TV app and its exclusive content available on Android devices isn't exactly earth-shattering, it does suggest that the company is open to new revenue sources it likely wouldn't have considered in the past.\n\nAnd, once again, this is Apple. It didn't get to be the world's largest company just by sheer luck.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nFinally, add Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%) to your list of stocks that could be easy wealth builders.\n\nThere's no denying that Alphabet's highest-growth days are in the past. While breadwinning Google still dominates the search engine/web advertising industry and Alphabet's Android remains the leading name in mobile device operating systems, both markets are mature, crowded, and surprisingly competitive.\n\nDon't confuse a mature and crowded market with a slow-growth one, though. Google's search revenue still improved to the tune of 12% during the final quarter of last year, capping off full-year growth of about the same rate and extending a long streak of comparable forward progress.\n\nCredit the fact that we're all increasingly connected to the internet and increasingly dependent on our mobile devices. That's not apt to change anytime soon, either. If anything, we're likely to see even more immersion into these technologies. Market research outfit SkyQuest Technologies predicts that the worldwide search engine market alone is poised to grow at an annualized pace of 10% through 2032, while the global app market is apt to grow from a little less than $190 billion last year to nearly $290 billion by 2028, according to forecasts published by Sensor Tower.\n\nThat being said, perhaps the top reason to own a stake in Alphabet for the foreseeable future is the work it's doing with artificial intelligence. Not only is its AI-powered chat platform Gemini showing incredible promise as a traffic-generating and engagement-improving tool, but it's also clearly valuable to companies that want to utilize artificial intelligence for their employees as well as their customers. Although uptake of generative AI tools among businesses has been tepid so far, as the Motley Fool's own in-house research points out, business usage of artificial intelligence within the United States is expected to grow from 6.8% of companies now to 9.3% in just a few months.\n\nFurther down the road, Google's current work on quantum computing will pay off. In December, the company unveiled a quantum chip called Willow, which completed a calculation in five minutes that would take most conventional modern-day computers 10 septillion years (that's a one followed by 25 zeros) to finish. It's not quite ready for proverbial primetime just yet, but when it is, this tech will plug Alphabet into a market that Precedence Research believes is set to grow at an average annual pace of 31% through 2034, when it should be worth more than $16 billion per year.",

But stocks have tumbled under Trump 2.0 so far.SHAWN THEW POOL/AFP/Getty mages\n\nPresident Donald Trump has more billionaires in his administration than any previous president, with at least nine. He counts plenty of billionaires as friends or fans: 16 visited him at Mar-a-Lago between the election and inauguration. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly just went to the White House on Wednesday following a Trump-Zuck White House meeting in early February.\n\nBut having a pro-business, pro-capitalism president who is also a billionaire hasn\u2019t turned out very well so far for the members of the three-comma-club.

That downturn hit the country\u2019s richest people in a big way: collectively, American billionaires are now $415 billion poorer, Forbes calculates.\n\nBy contrast the S&P 500 inched up 2.4% and the Nasdaq down 1% in the same period following Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. Over that same timespan, U.S. billionaires got $153 billion richer\u2013a 3.6% increase.\n\nAmong the factors driving stocks lower: Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again decisions on imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That has created uncertainty\u2013something that corporate leaders abhor. Plus, the new 25% tariffs that Trump placed on all steel and aluminum imports earlier this week look to be setting off a trade war, with the E.U. planning to launch its own tariffs on U.S. goods on April 1. Adding to the concerns: in early March the Atlanta Fed predicted a 2.8% contraction in economic growth for the first quarter\u2013in what\u2019s being dubbed a \u201cTrumpcession.\u201d\n\nNo billionaire has been hit as hard as Trump\u2019s right hand man, Elon Musk. On January 20, the world\u2019s richest person was worth $434 billion. Since then, reports have emerged of dramatic declines in Tesla car sales in the first two months of 2025 in Germany, China and Australia; analysts at JPMorgan cut their forecast for first quarter 2025 deliveries of Tesla vehicles by 20% to 355,000, the lowest since the third quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, protests against Tesla and Musk have erupted across the country at Tesla dealerships; while some are peaceful, others have included incidents of vandalism.\n\nAmid it all, shares of Tesla have plunged 43% since the inauguration. That in turn erased $104 billion from Musk\u2019s fortune, which was $330 billion after the stock market closed on Thursday, per Forbes estimates. Despite the 24% drop in his net worth, he has held onto his spot as No. 1 wealthiest on the planet.\n\nRoss Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management, doesn\u2019t believe this hit to Musk\u2019s wealth is surprising, or has much to do with Musk\u2019s multiple roles of late. \u201cI don\u2019t think Musk\u2019s place in the [Trump] administration is probably helping\u2026 but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary driver. If we\u2019re heading towards an economic slowdown, autos and cyclicals get hit the hardest, and autos are also really exposed to cross-border trade and tariffs,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\nThe market rout has also hit several additional tech stocks hard. The once high-flying Magnificent 7\u2013Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft\u2013have collectively lost more than $1.5 trillion of their market value since Jan. 20 amid concerns about economic weakness.\n\nThe leaders of several of those companies, including Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Google (now Alphabet) cofounder Sergey Brin, and Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg, all attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and were given prominent placement among the attendees at the Capitol. These tycoons are now all among those whose fortunes have plunged the most since that celebration.\n\nHere are the 20 U.S. billionaires who lost the most since January 20, 2025: (Net worths are as of market close on Thursday, March 13):\n\n1.

AAPL is reportedly facing internal turmoil as it struggles to fix major AI failures in Siri, with a top executive calling the delays ugly and embarrassing after the company prematurely marketed features that weren't ready.\n\nWhat Happened: During an all-hands meeting for Apple's Siri division, senior director Robby Walker acknowledged the frustration among employees over the repeated delays of key AI-powered Siri enhancements, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This was not one of those situations where we get to show people our plan after it's done,\" Walker told staff, referring to Apple's demonstration of its AI features at WWDC. \"We showed people before.\"\n\nSee Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Anthropic Pushes For Stronger US AI Safeguards, Saying Autocracies Like China, Russia Could Use AI To Expand Their Power\n\nWalker admitted that Apple's marketing team made the situation worse by promoting the upcoming Siri features in TV commercials and branding campaigns despite knowing they were not ready for launch.\n\nInitially expected in early 2024, the AI-powered Siri enhancements\u2014designed to improve personal assistant functionality, data integration, and app control\u2014have been repeatedly delayed due to performance issues.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nWalker said Apple found that the features only worked properly two-thirds to 80% of the time, meaning they failed one out of every three attempts.\n\nApple now aims to roll out the improvements in iOS 19, but Walker warned that even this timeline is uncertain, citing competing priorities within Apple's software and hardware teams.\n\nWhy It's Important: The delays highlight Apple's ongoing struggles in AI, particularly as competitors like OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Microsoft Corporation MSFT advance rapidly.\n\nSiri has lagged behind rivals, and these setbacks reinforce concerns about Apple's ability to compete in the AI space.\n\nApple's AI missteps come as the company faces a 12.45% stock decline year-to-date amid broader market struggles.\n\nEarlier this week, Morgan Stanley raised concerns over Apple\u2019s AI delay, cutting its price target from $275 to $252.\n\nMeanwhile, in a bid to regain its footing, Apple has reportedly partnered with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA to enhance AI features in iPhones for the Chinese market.

PHOTO: AFP\n\nBANGKOK \u2013 Thailand aims to slash electricity costs by more than 25 per cent by 2026 to emerge as a hub for data centres and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, the de facto chief of the ruling Pheu Thai Party.\n\nThe government headed by his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra plans to bring down the electricity tariff to about 8 US cents (S$0.11) per unit from about 11 cents now, Mr Thaksin told a business seminar in Bangkok late on March 14. He did not elaborate on how the government would slash the rate, which is currently subsidised by state utilities.\n\nThailand has secured billions of dollars in investment commitments from tech majors including Amazon.com, Alphabet\u2019s Google, ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and Alibaba Group to build projects for large data centres and cloud services. Building on that success would depend on the country\u2019s ability to offer clean and cheap energy, Mr Thaksin said.\n\n\u201cWe want to be competitive in data centres and AI,\u201d Mr Thaksin said, adding that he has been talking to many people who want to invest in Thailand in these areas. \u201cSo we need to have more green energy that\u2019s not too expensive.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr Thaksin does not hold any official position in his daughter\u2019s administration, the two-time premier is viewed by many as shaping the government\u2019s major policy initiatives.\n\nMr Thaksin said Thailand\u2019s ability to slash the electricity cost to 2 to 6 cents per unit \u2013 a level seen as ideal by some investors \u2013 is limited by its reliance on fossil fuel and natural gas imports for power generation.\n\nThailand currently charges 4.15 baht (S$0.17) per unit of electricity on both commercial and household users. Mr Thaksin said it was possible to bring it down to 2.50 baht step by step.\n\nMr Thaksin said his dream was to convert an area in Bangkok to house data centres of every country in the world, followed by an AI hub.\n\nThe return of a civilian government in 2023 after a decade of military-backed rule saw foreign companies ramp up investment in electric vehicles, advanced electronics manufacturing and diverse tech services. Investment pledges from foreign and domestic companies totalled 1.14 trillion baht in 2024, the highest in a decade.

            "content": "Tech giant Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) DeepMind unit has revealed two new artificial intelligence models that are designed to improve the capabilities of robots. The models, which are known as Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, hope to allow robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks that require complex actions, such as manipulating objects and advanced spatial understanding.\n\nInterestingly, the Gemini Robotics model is an advanced vision-language-action model that allows robots to directly control physical actions. Meanwhile, the Gemini Robotics-ER model builds on this capability by adding advanced spatial understanding. This will allow robots to navigate and interact with their environment better. DeepMind believes that these models will see progress in three key areas: generality, interactivity, and dexterity.\n\nIt is worth noting that the potential applications of these models are significant. For example, Gemini Robotics can tackle complex tasks like origami folding or packing snacks into a Ziploc bag. DeepMind is already working with partners such as Apptronik to integrate the models into robots like the Apollo robot. The Gemini Robotics-ER model is also being tested by certain companies like Boston Dynamics and Agile Robots.\n\nIs Google Stock a Good Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 25 Buys and 11 Holds assigned in the past three months. After a 20% rally in the past 12 months, the average GOOGL price target of $215.88 per share implies 29.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

These seven biggest American technology companies are known for their market dominance, technological impact, and influence on consumer behavior and economic trends. In Monday's stock market carnage, these seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered its steepest fall since the year 2022, as analysts point to concerns over new trade tariffs, which could increase prices for companies reliant on overseas parts and manufacturing.In the brutal day for Wall Street, megacap tech companies saw their market values plummet, with Apple leading the charge by shedding a huge $174 billion. Nvidia, the frontrunner in AI chipmaking, wasn't far behind, losing nearly $140 billion as its shares closed down 5%. The company's value has shrunk by almost a third in just two months since reaching a new peak in January.Tesla experienced the steepest percentage drop, with shares of the electric vehicle manufacturer tumbling 15% -\u2014 their worst performance since 2020. The company has now lost over half its value since mid-December and is coming off its longest weekly losing streak as a public company. Monday's losses alone amounted to $130 billion.Other tech heavyweights also took a hit. Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet saw their market caps shrink by $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively, while Amazon and Meta lost $50 billion and $70 billion. Alphabet and Meta each dropped more than 4%, with Microsoft and Amazon declining at least 2%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell over 4%, officially entering correction territory with shares more than 14% below their high.Semiconductor makers, a key target of the new levies, were hit hard. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has dropped 3% in the past week and is down over 16% since the inauguration, with a further 5% decline on Monday. Marvell Technology shed 8%, ASML Holding and Micron Technology each slumped more than 6%, and Broadcom fell 5%.

However, the stock is still vulnerable to the same kinds of macro-level risks as the rest of the stock market, and in February, a combination of weaker-than-expected revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings report and broader worries around the global economy sent the stock tumbling. By the end of the month, Alphabet had lost 17%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, erasing more than $300 billion in market value from the company.\n\nAs the chart below shows, the stock fell early in the month on the earnings report and at the end of February as part of a broader sell-off in the market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\n^SPX Chart\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\n\nQ4 results underwhelm\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 12% to $96.47 billion, though that was below estimates at $96.67 billion. It was also notably slower than rival Meta Platforms' growth, showing that the Google parent appears to be losing market share to its largest digital advertising competitor. The figure also represented a slowdown from earlier in the year.\n\nOn the bottom line, earnings per share rose from $1.64 to $2.15, which was slightly ahead of the consensus at $2.13.\n\nAlphabet doesn't give full guidance, but investors seemed skeptical about its plans to ramp up capital expenditures to $75 billion in 2025 from $52.4 billion in 2024 to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as it's not clear that that's currently driving significant revenue for the company.\n\nLater in the month, Alphabet pulled back again in line with a broader sell-off in the market on macro and tech sector issues. Tech stocks fell on reports that Microsoft was canceling some data center leases, and after Nvidia stock sold off in spite of solid earnings report, indicating that investors may believe that AI stocks had gotten overvalued.\n\nAdditionally, tariff threats seemed to push stock lower. Google also announced job cuts in its cloud division, which could improve profits, but may also be a sign of slowing growth.\n\nA person clicking on a search bar.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's next for Alphabet\n\nAs the leader in digital advertising, Alphabet is sensitive to global economic growth and business spending, and in a recession, companies tend to cut back on advertising spending first so investors should expect the stock to move on macro news.\n\nAdditionally, while the company has stood its ground in the AI race, there is still some concern that its search leadership is vulnerable to competition from OpenAI and others.\n\nHowever, those concerns seem priced in and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.5. If Alphabet can maintain its current growth rate, the stock should move higher from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nDetermined to lead the AI frontier, China is deploying every resource at its disposal and mobilizing every tool in its arsenal. In the latest news, Reuters has reported how the country is now planning to expand its undergraduate enrollments to prioritize what it called \"national strategic needs\" and develop talent in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSeveral of China\u2019s top public universities have announced these plans of expansion following the launch of artificial intelligence courses in February. The country recently experienced a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d after an AI startup from within the country, DeepSeek, launched a cheaper and more efficient AI model which it claimed outperforms its Western counterparts.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely Right Now and 12 AI Stocks Making Headlines: Latest News and Ratings\n\nAccording to analysts, DeepSeek's success is largely backed by researchers from elite domestic universities. This fact reflects how Beijing's investment in building a large homegrown STEM talent pool and recent U.S. restrictions on Chinese student visas have enabled the country to catch up on the AI race.\n\n\u201cScientific and technological innovation has contributed to China\u2019s economic growth, with investment in high-tech industries increasing by 11.1 percent year-on-year from January to October 2022\u201d.\n\nInnovation has also opened up new areas for China\u2019s economic development, such as renewable energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic products. The country\u2019s scientific and technological innovations have helped it garner global attention, and it looks like it is neck to neck in competition with its competitor, the United States.\n\nNoting the country\u2019s need for further advancement, Peking University recently said it would add 150 undergraduate spots in 2025, focusing on areas of \"national strategic importance\", fundamental disciplines and \"emerging frontier fields\". Meanwhile, Renmin University said it would add more than 100 places in areas such as AI to improve innovation.\n\nShanghai Jiao Tong University will also be adding 150 spots concentrating on \"cutting-edge technologies\" and emerging industries \"urgently needed\", in AI, integrated circuits, biomedicine, healthcare and new energy.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

A notable event was Esri's announcement of a collaboration with Google Maps, indicating Alphabet's broader engagement in enhancing geospatial data technology. However, Alphabet's performance mirrored wider market trends, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped amid political and economic uncertainty triggered by new tariffs announced by the Trump administration. A 1.5% fall in the company's share price was part of this broader trend where major indices, including the Nasdaq, suffered losses. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 experienced declines as well due to investor concerns over potential economic repercussions from these tariffs. Despite Alphabet's smaller weekly slide compared to the broader 4.6% market drop, these external factors significantly influenced the company's on-market total returns during this period.\n\nNavigate through the intricacies of Alphabet with our comprehensive report here.\n\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Alphabet's total shareholder returns reached 210.65%, indicating substantial growth. This increase can be attributed to multiple factors, including steady earnings performance. Notably, the company's earnings expanded by 17.7% annually, outpacing broader industry trends. Alphabet's pricing strategies and product innovations, such as the recent partnerships with Upbound Group and Vodafone, have been pivotal in this upward trajectory. These collaborations, focusing on AI and digital solutions, have positioned Alphabet at the forefront of technological advancements.\n\nEnhancing shareholder value, Alphabet initiated a share repurchase program, acquiring shares worth billions of dollars, which supported its stock price. The initiation of a dividend program last year further boosted investor confidence. Despite encountering legal challenges like the Google Play Store lawsuit, Alphabet's robust financial health, illustrated by strong profit margins and comprehensive revenue growth, contributed to its impressive five-year performance. In the past year, Alphabet's stock outperformed the US market and matched industry peers, reflecting its significant market presence despite broader economic challenges.",

            "content": "You can count on three things in life: death, taxes, and the stock market eventually experiencing a down period. Unfortunately, the latter is exactly what has happened with the Nasdaq Composite, as the index has fallen into correction territory.\n\nA stock market correction is when a major stock market index drops between 10% and 20% from recent highs, and the Nasdaq Composite checked that box, down over 13% from its Dec. 16 record high when the market closed March 10.\n\nInvestors may not like corrections, but they're a natural part of the stock market cycle, and there's often not one singular event that causes them. They can be caused by falling market sentiment, political and economic concerns, global events, or a combination of them all and other things.\n\nIn any case, an important thing investors can do is view a market drop as an opportunity to grab shares of great companies that may have gotten a lot cheaper. One in particular, Alphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%), seems like a bargain after recent drops.\n\nStock price drops don't always mean a business is slumping\n\nAs of March 10, Alphabet's stock is down 12% year to date and close to 20% from its 12-month high, which it hit on Feb. 4. The only \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks with a worse performance year to date are Tesla and Nvidia.\n\nAs the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and other subsidiaries, Alphabet has an arsenal of top-tier ventures. And despite the rough start to the year, Alphabet's business remains as strong as ever, especially financially.\n\nIn 2024, Alphabet made over $350 billion in revenue, up 14% year over year, making it one of the premier cash cows in the business world. Maybe more impressive, though, is the 31% jump in operating income from 2023, while its operating margin also improved by 5%.\n\nGoogle advertising continues to be Alphabet's biggest moneymaker, but segments like Google Cloud and YouTube have consistently grown and contributed their share to the pot. Both businesses combined to finish 2024 with an annual revenue run rate of $110 billion (a measure that estimates annual revenue based on the fourth quarter).\n\nGoogle Cloud is a key to growth\n\nCloud services have become a big part of many big tech companies' businesses. Amazon's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure are the two biggest platforms by market share, but Google Cloud's 12% market share is double what it was around seven years ago.\n\nGoogle Cloud's revenue grew 30% year over year in the fourth quarter to $12 billion, fueled by the demand for its cloud services, including data storage and analytics, machine learning, computing, and similar tools.\n\nAlphabet plans to spend around $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, and you can bet a large chunk of that will go toward expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and bolstering Google Cloud to make it more competitive for the long haul.\n\nCloud computing can be a high-margin business, but it generally requires a large scale to achieve high profitability because of the expensive fixed costs.\n\nAlphabet's stock is a bargain\n\nAfter recent drops, Alphabet's stock looks a lot more appealing. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 20.5 as I write this, well below its average over 10 years.\n\nAlphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks when comparing P/E ratios. And although that alone doesn't automatically make it a good investment, it shows the market may be undervaluing the company and its growth potential compared to other big tech stocks.\n\nThis isn't to say Alphabet's stock won't face any short-term troubles (especially as the broader Nasdaq does), but if you're investing for the long term, the picture looks bright.",

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 11, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc.'s AVGO and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhich AI Stock Is a Better Buy Now: NVDA or AVGO?\n\nWith the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI), both NVIDIA Corp. and Broadcom Inc.'s shares have scaled upward. However, to manage AI workloads, Broadcom's custom AI accelerators, designed in collaboration with Alphabet Inc., compete directly with NVIDIA's graphic processing units (GPUs). In this context, let's explore which one of them has the upper hand and is a better buy.\n\nReasons to Be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock\n\nThe threat from DeepSeek's cost-efficient large language model has been blown out of proportion, and it shouldn't have a long-term impact on NVIDIA. This is because low-cost models will, in due course, drive more use of computing power and assist NVIDIA. The semiconductor giant, nevertheless, has the necessary resources to create affordable products and enhance the AI ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers at the moment prefer NVIDIA's CUDA software platform more than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (AMD) ROCm software platform. Moreover, any change from CUDA to ROCm is unlikely due to the unmanageable infrastructure transitions.\n\nNVIDIA's market leadership in the GPU market has already given the company a competitive edge and will drive future growth. Additionally, NVIDIA's latest quarterly sales for the Blackwell AI processor exceeded Wall Street expectations due to its insane demand. This demand is likely to persist thanks to Blackwell's faster AI interface and enhanced efficiency.\n\nReasons to Be Bullish on Broadcom Stock\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom's custom AI accelerators and application-specific integrated chips is set to drive revenue growth. Broadcom expects to tap into the demand for custom AI accelerators, projecting a market size of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027.\n\nBroadcom's revenues from custom AI accelerators and connectivity switches were $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024, up 220% from fiscal 2023. Broadcom expects AI revenues to grow for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025.\n\nAcquiring VMware has benefited Broadcom's infrastructure software solutions. The company has added more than 4500 of its top customers to VMware Cloud Foundation for deploying private cloud environments on-premises.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom has generated substantial cash flows in fiscal 2024, which enabled it to pay out dividends. The company also spent on share repurchases as management remained confident about future earnings.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Better Buy Than AVGO Stock?\n\nEbbing DeepSeek concerns, GPU dominance, and high demand for Blackwell chips will continue to boost NVIDIA. On the other hand, strong demand for custom AI accelerators will benefit Broadcom.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's custom AI accelerators can't outperform NVIDIA's GPUs because they work best when a workload is primarily assigned to run through a Broadcom-designed accelerator.\n\nUnlike NVIDIA, Broadcom has a much broader business. But it's the AI hardware segment that drove sales growth in the fiscal year 2024, while its other segments struggled. Moreover, its revenue growth in the fiscal year 2024 is nothing compared to NVIDIA's revenue growth of $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025, up 114% year over year.\n\nNVIDIA's higher revenue growth makes it a better buy than Broadcom currently. To top it off, buying NVIDIA stock is a more cost-effective option compared to Broadcom. After all, per the price/earnings ratio, NVDA trades at 25.6X forward earnings. In comparison, AVGO's forward earnings multiple is 30.83.\n\nNVIDIA stock, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Broadcom stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "content": "Tech biggie Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google is reviving its push into the smart glasses segment, with a $115 million acquisition of AdHawk Microsystems. Canada-based AdHawk provides eye-tracking technology featuring low-power components that enable effective analysis of a user\u2019s corneas and pupils quicker than rival sensors. The news was first reported by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nWhat Is AdHawk Microsystems?\n\nAdHawk was founded in 2017 and manufactures the necessary software, hardware, and chips that determine where a user is looking. The startup also launched its own glasses called MindLink, while it also sells the technology to other manufacturers. Some of AdHawk\u2019s investors include Intel Corp. (INTC), Venture funds of Samsung Electronics (SSNLF), Sony Group Corp. (SONY), and Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica SA (ESLOY).\n\nOf the total consideration, $15 million is conditioned on AdHawk reaching certain performance milestones. Although the discussions are in the final stages, the deal could fall apart since the agreement is not signed yet. Also, the companies are looking to close the deal as soon as this week, if all goes well.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Renewed Push Threatens Meta and Apple\n\nGoogle\u2019s renewed push in the smart eyewear segment could be a big blow to rivals Meta Platforms (META) wide range of smart glasses and Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro headsets. Google\u2019s earlier attempt to create smart glasses (Glass) failed miserably as it failed to garner enough consumer attention and was discontinued in 2023. Interestingly, Meta had also pursued acquiring AdHawk in 2022 but the deal did not go through. An effective eye-tracking mechanism is the corner stone in building accurate Augmented Reality (AR) and vision devices.\n\nGoogle has also partnered with Samsung in developing its upcoming Moohan headset, loaded with Google\u2019s Android XR. The software allows developers to use its framework to integrate eye-tracking support for their apps. The AdHawk team will reportedly join Google\u2019s Android XR team, once the deal is completed. Since its last failure, Google has promised to return to the smart glasses segment with the addition of AI (artificial intelligence). The acquisition of AdHawk backed by its superior quality, low latency, high speed, and minimal compute technology could be just the right step in that direction.\n\nIs Google Stock Good to Buy?\n\nAnalysts remain divided on Alphabet\u2019s stock trajectory. On TipRanks, GOOGL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. The average Alphabet Class A price target of $215.88 implies 31.6% upside potential from current levels. In the past year, GOOGL stock has gained 19%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software for mobile phones and tablet computers . In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put the company in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones. Google\u2019s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with Apple , IBM , and Microsoft . Despite its myriad of products, the original search tool remains the core of Google\u2019s success. In 2023, Alphabet took in $175 billion in revenue (57% of all Google revenue) from advertising based on users\u2019 search requests.\n\nMost search engines simply returned a list of websites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each website had. A website with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities.\n\nBrin and Page, who met as graduate students at Stanford University , were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page\u2019s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage users\u2019 own ranking abilities by tracking each website\u2019s \u201cbacking links\u201d\u2014that is, the number of other pages linked to them.\n\nIn mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing. (One of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of Sun Microsystems, Inc. ). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in Menlo Park , California, under the name Google, which was derived from a misspelling of Page\u2019s original planned name, googol (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of venture capital funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day. Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web\u2019s most popular sites, Yahoo! . By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google\u2019s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued; by the end of 2011, Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company\u2019s name became so ubiquitous that it entered the lexicon as a verb. To google became a common expression for searching the Internet.\n\nTo accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centers around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, multiprocessor personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). The heart of Google\u2019s operation, however, is built around three proprietary pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in \u201cchunks\u201d across several machines; Bigtable is the company\u2019s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201ctheater,\u201d and \u201cparticipatory\u201d).\n\nThe extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who had previously held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in computer science and melded well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt\u2019s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a \u201ctriumvirate\u201d until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to the S&P 500 Index) in 2006. By 2012, Google\u2019s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nStrategic acquisitions and monetizing Google\u2019s search engine\n\nGoogle\u2019s strong financial results reflected the rapid growth of Internet advertising in general and Google\u2019s popularity in particular. Analysts attributed part of that success to a shift in advertising spending toward the Internet and away from traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, and television. For example, American newspaper advertising fell from a peak of $64 billion in 2000 to $20.7 billion in 2011, while global online advertising grew from approximately $6 billion in 2000 to more than $72 billion in 2011.\n\nSince its founding, Google has spent large sums to secure what it has calculated to be significant Internet marketing advantages. For example, in 2003, Google spent $102 million to acquire Applied Semantics, the makers of AdSense, a service that signed up owners of websites to run various types of ads on their web pages. In 2006 Google again paid $102 million for another Web advertisement business, dMarc Broadcasting, and that same year it announced that it would pay $900 million over three and a half years for the right to sell ads on MySpace.com. In 2007 Google made its largest acquisition to date, buying online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. Two years later the company responded to the explosive growth of the mobile applications market with a $750 million deal to acquire the mobile advertising network AdMob. All of these purchases were part of Google\u2019s effort to expand from its search engine business into advertising by combining the various firms\u2019 databases of information in order to tailor ads to consumers\u2019 individual preferences.",

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.22%) has now fallen into correction territory and is down roughly 11.8% since Feb. 18.\n\nShares of Alphabet (GOOGL 1.87%) traded 5% lower as of 11:17 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.63%) traded down 4.2%, while shares of Oracle (ORCL 4.65%) were down 4.1%.\n\nGoogle gets reprieve but isn't out of the woods\n\nInvestors are still selling as they worry about (1) economic data further pointing to a slowdown, and (2) President Trump's tariffs, which have catapulted into a trade war that seems to change by the day. However, there was also a lot of company-specific news.\n\nOn March 7, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) rescinded a claim that asked a federal judge to force Google to sell its holdings in certain artificial intelligence companies including OpenAI competitor Anthropic. The DOJ previously sued Google for monopolistic ad and search practices, allegations that a federal judge agreed with last year.\n\nFollowing the suit, the DOJ made a number of punitive proposals to a federal court. While the DOJ dropped the proposal regarding Anthropic, it didn't drop its request to have Google sell its Chrome browser, a move that would clearly shake up the entire search industry if granted by a judge. Many have wondered how President Trump's deregulatory approach might impact this case, and the DOJ's recent filings suggest that it still plans to take a tough approach with Google, at least for the time being.\n\nAnalysts at Moffett Nathanson issued a report following the DOJ's filing and said that the DOJ is \"not calling off the dogs.\" The firm also called the filings a \"disappointment\" that also \"shouldn't be a surprise.\" Trump did take a pretty aggressive approach to big tech during his first term.\n\nIn other news, this morning, Taiwan Semiconductor said that its revenue in the first two months of 2025 surged 39% year over year, citing strong demand for AI chips. The news builds on momentum from January when the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and said AI demand continues to be strong.\n\nOracle will report its third-quarter fiscal earnings after the market closes today, and analysts are largely bullish heading into the report. Wall Street is forecasting an 11% increase to adjusted earnings per share from the prior quarter, while revenue is expected to rise 8%, according to FactSet.\n\nMore reasonably valued names\n\nMany tech and AI stocks now face pressure, with elevated valuations running into a wall, largely due to broader economic and market concerns. Stocks with higher valuations are going to be more susceptible to bad news.\n\nThat said, if you're still looking to buy tech and AI stocks, you could do a lot worse than Alphabet, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Oracle. All three now trade between 18x and 24x forward earnings.\n\nAlphabet could have significant upside from its AI capabilities not yet being priced into the stock. Taiwan Semiconductor continues to produce solid results, and analysts seem optimistic heading into Oracle's earnings. These are also companies expected to be at the helm of AI and tech for the foreseeable future.",

The tech sector has made major investments in nuclear projects over the past year to meet rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence with reliable, carbon-free energy.\n\nBut new nuclear projects in the U.S. have been plagued by cost overruns and long delays. It is imperative that the public and private sectors move \"as soon as possible\" to build a series of new plants that replicate the construction process to drive down the cost curve, Porat said.\n\nAlphabet's Google unit struck a deal last October to buy power from small modular reactors under development by Kairos Power. These smaller nuclear reactors are next-generation technology that the industry hopes will reduce costs and accelerate deployment timelines through manufacturing efficiencies. Google and Kairos aim to bring the first plant online by 2030 with more reactors starting up through 2035.\n\n\"If we don't start now in a focused way and replicate a number of them, which is why the Kairos multi tranche is an important kind of proof point, we're not going to be able to drive down the cost curve,\" Porat said.\n\nNuclear, however, is unlikely to become a power solution until the 2035 or later, said NextEra CEO John Ketchum said. NextEra is the largest developer of renewables in the U.S., though the company also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the nation as well nuclear plants.\n\nKetchum said renewables are the quickest and cheapest solution available to meet rising energy demand, as the cost of new natural gas turbines has tripled and the queue to build them now stretches to 2030 or later.\n\n\"Renewables are ready to go right now because they've been up and running,\" Ketchum said at the conference. \"It's cheaper and it's available right now unless you already have a turbine on order or that's already been permitted.\"\n\nKetchum's comments come after Energy Secretary Chris Wright said earlier Monday that renewables cannot replace the role of natural gas in producing electricity, vowing to end the Biden administration's climate policies. The Trump administration is working to launch a new era of nuclear construction, Wright said.\n\nNextEra is projecting a sixfold increase in power demand over the next 20 years compared with the previous 20 years, Ketchum said. About 17% of that growth will come from data centers, the CEO said. The U.S. has installed 175 gigawatts of renewables over the past five years, compared to 13 gigawatts of gas and about three gigawatts nuclear, Ketchum said.\n\nNextEra is evaluating whether the company can bring the shuttered Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa back online, Ketchum said. Duane Arnold is the third potential nuclear restart in the U.S., with the Palisades plant in Michigan aiming to return to power this year and Three Mile Island Unit 1 in 2028 subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn terms of small modular reactors, there is a \"tremendous opportunity to co-locate\" these reactors \"at all of our existing sites,\" Ketchum said. \"But the industry needs to sort through which companies have the right technology,\" he said.\n\nThere are around 95 companies involved in the small modular reactor space right now. \"That's really got to be scaled down to five or 10,\" Ketchum said.",

            "content": "Shares of Google parent Alphabet plunged nearly 5% early Monday in the first trading session since President Trump\u2019s Justice Department confirmed it is seeking a breakup of the online search giant\u2019s monopoly.\n\nDOJ attorneys formally asked US District Judge Amit Mehta to force Google to sell off its Chrome web browser. Mehta ruled last August that Google was a \u201cmonopolist\u201d with an illegal stranglehold on the search market, fueled in part by billions in payments to partners like Apple to ensure its search engine is enabled by default on most smartphones.\n\nIn a scathing court filing late Friday, the DOJ said Google had relied on \u201cillegal conduct\u201d to create an \u201ceconomic goliath\u201d that \u201cwreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins.\u201d\n\n3 The DOJ confirmed it will seek a forced selloff of Google\u2019s Chrome web browser. REUTERS\n\n\u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy,\u201d the DOJ said in its court filing.\n\nThe selloff occurred alongside broader market turmoil that saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq index plunge nearly 600 points, or 3.2%. Alphabet shares are down nearly 13% since the start of the year.\n\nThe proposal was largely in line with the remedies first outlined in a preliminary filing by then-President Biden\u2019s DOJ last year. It confirmed that a crackdown on Google is likely to continue under Trump, who has been sharply critical of the company\u2019s practices.\n\nGoogle Chrome accounts for \u201cmore than 30 percent of search inquiries,\u201d according to the filing.\n\n3 Google parent Alphabet has since nearly 13% since the start of the year. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe feds said that Google should have to end its \u201cdefault search engine\u201d partnerships with Apple, AT&T and other firms. Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone to be the default engine on its Safari browser.\n\nGoogle should also be required to share its data related to search and digital ads with rivals to help ensure a level playing field.\n\nThe DOJ also recommends forcing Google to divest its Android operating system if initial remedies are \u201cnot effective.\u201d\n\nIn a shift from its past position, however, the DOJ dropped its request that Google be forced to sell off its investments in artificial intelligence firms, such as Anthropic. Instead, Google should provide advance notice for \u201cfuture investments\u201d in AI.\n\n3 Google CEO Sundar Pichai was one of several tech executives who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMehta will hold hearings in April to consider arguments from the DOJ and Google on proposed remedies. The judge\u2019s final decision is expected this summer.\n\nGoogle has vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling on the case.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the DOJ\u2019s \u201csweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision, and would harm America\u2019s consumers, economy and national security.\u201d\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai was one of several tech executives who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January as part of an industry-wide effort to reset relations with the president.\n\nCompany executives also met with Trump officials in recent weeks to push for leniency in the search case, Bloomberg reported. Google argued in part that any forced breakup could jeopardize national security.",

Over the weekend, President Trump fielded questions regarding recession worries on FOX News, calling the market struggle \"a period of transition,\" but that didn't do much to calm investors. The sell-off was particularly pronounced in the tech sector, with the Nasdaq falling 3% into correction territory, while the S&P 500 also posted a 2% decline.\n\nSeparately, recent court documents revealed the DOJ (Department of Justice) wasn't backing off in its investigation, which could lead to a potential breakup of the company. MoffettNathanson analysts believed the \"saga will continue through the spring and into the summer until a final remedy ruling comes.\".\n\nThe shares closed the day at $165.87, down 4.6% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Alphabet? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 28 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about a month ago when the stock dropped 8.7% on the news that the company reported underwhelming fourth-quarter 2024 results. Its total revenue was in line and its Google Cloud revenue missed, spooking some investors who had high expectations.\n\nGiven the secular trends surrounding Google Cloud along with its long-term profit margin potential, it was increasingly a sharp focus of investors and the market. We note that Microsoft's Azure division also posted worse-than-anticipated results, signaling the market was overly optimistic about cloud computing for Q4.\n\nOn the brighter side, advertising revenue slightly exceeded expectations, driven by strong contributions from both Search and YouTube. It was also encouraging to see Alphabet beat analysts' operating income expectations.\n\nIn AI, the company earmarked $75 billion for capital expenditures in 2025\u2014well ahead of Wall Street's estimates. It also rolled out its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0, to the public, aiming to expand its reach and stay competitive with rivals.",

            "content": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the undisputed leader in cloud computing, generating the majority of the company's operating income while benefiting from long-term secular growth in enterprise cloud adoption. Additionally, Amazon is aggressively investing in AI infrastructure and services, including a major stake in Anthropic, the developer of one of the most widely used large language models (LLMs). With AI adoption accelerating across industries, Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on cloud-based AI workloads and enterprise AI integration.\n\nAmazon has long been a dominant force in e-commerce and cloud computing, two of the most transformative economic trends of the past two decades and which continue to be leading industries. The company continues to reinvent itself as it expands into new, high-growth verticals, including artificial intelligence and digital advertising among others.\n\nAmong the highest-quality businesses in the world, perhaps in history, are the Magnificent 7, a group of tech giants that have demonstrated exceptional resilience and innovation. Today, I'm highlighting three of them: Alphabet , Amazon and Meta Platforms . These companies are not only trading at discounts relative to their historical valuations, which helps limit downside risk, but they also offer exceptional long-term return potential due to their dominance in powerful secular trends shaping the future of technology and commerce.\n\nWhile corrections like this can trigger concerns about further downside and lead to emotional reactions, it's important to keep the bigger picture in mind. The U.S. stock market has been climbing for over a century, and history shows that periods of correction often present excellent buying opportunities. However, the key is to focus on high-quality companies with strong track records of consistent sales and earnings growth over the long term.\n\nThe US stock market has entered correction territory, with the S&P 500 8% off its recent all-time highs and the Nasdaq 100 down 11%. This sharp sell-off has been driven primarily by uncertainty surrounding tariff trade policy and to a lesser extent the effects of large federal spending cuts. Both catalysts have cut economic growth projections and added significant ambiguity for any businesses doing international trade.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Amazon is trading at historically low levels, making it an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. The stock's 10-year median forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 87.6x, yet it currently trades at just 31.8x forward earnings, marking the cheapest valuation in the company's recent history. Given that earnings are projected to grow at an annualized rate of 22.85% over the next three to five years, this sharp multiple compression significantly limits downside risk while setting the stage for strong long-term returns.\n\nAlphabet: Historical Discount and Huge Growth Opportunities\n\nAlphabet remains a fundamental pillar of the digital economy, with its core business, Google Search, continuing to deliver steady sales and earnings growth despite investor concerns that AI could disrupt traditional search volume. In reality, Alphabet is proactively integrating AI into its ecosystem, with early data suggesting that AI-powered search summaries are enhancing user engagement rather than eroding traffic. The company has also teased a next-generation AI search product, reinforcing its commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation in online search.\n\nBeyond search, Alphabet has several underappreciated growth engines, the most notable being Waymo, its self-driving car subsidiary. While many competitors in autonomous driving are still in testing phases, Waymo is already operating at scale, providing over 200,000 rides per week. As the technology advances and expands into more cities, Waymo could become a major profit center that is barely factored into Alphabet's current valuation.\n\nAlphabet is also a key player in cloud computing, where Google Cloud is growing at an impressive 30% annually. With increasing demand for AI-driven workloads and enterprise cloud services, Google Cloud is becoming an increasingly important driver of the company's overall revenue growth.\n\nDespite these powerful long-term growth catalysts, Alphabet is trading at a historical discount. The stock's 10-year median forward P/E ratio is 25.8x, yet it currently trades at just 19.4x forward earnings. With earnings expected to grow at 15.5% annually over the next three to five years, this valuation compression presents a compelling opportunity for investors looking for both stability and upside.\n\nMeta Platforms: Among the Best Stocks in the Market\n\nMeta Platforms has cemented itself as one of the most dominant forces in digital advertising and social media, with an astounding 3.35 billion daily active users across its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Despite concerns about competition and shifting digital trends, Meta continues to thrive, proving itself to be an underappreciated cash-generating machine. Over the last decade, the company has grown earnings at an annualized rate of 36%, and today, it generates $1 billion in free cash flow every week, a staggering figure that highlights the strength of its business model.\n\nMeta has also been at the forefront of AI integration in digital advertising, using it to automate ad creation and optimize targeting across its platforms. By leveraging AI, Meta has made its ad network more efficient, allowing businesses to achieve better results while driving higher monetization and ad revenue growth for the company. This AI-powered approach is helping Meta stay ahead in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.\n\nLooking ahead, earnings are forecasted to grow at an annualized rate of 18.3% over the next three to five years, reinforcing the company's long-term expansion potential. Despite its incredible financial performance and robust growth outlook, Meta is trading at a historically reasonable valuation, with a forward earnings multiple of 23.5x, just below its 10-year median of 24.8x.\n\nShould Investors Buy Shares in META, GOOGL and AMZN?\n\nWith the market pulling back, investors have an opportunity to buy three of the highest-quality tech stocks at rare discounts. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms continue to dominate their respective industries, and each is well-positioned for long-term growth thanks to powerful secular trends in AI, cloud computing and digital advertising.\n\nUnlike many growth stocks, these companies are trading below their historical valuation averages, which not only limits downside risk but also enhances long-term return potential as earnings continue to expand. While short-term volatility may persist, investors with a long-term mindset could see this correction as a chance to accumulate shares in industry leaders with strong balance sheets, durable competitive advantages, and impressive earnings growth.\n\nFor those looking to buy the dip in big tech, these three names stand out as some of the best opportunities in the market today.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Adobe ADBE, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Adobe Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAdobe is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 12.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nFor first-quarter fiscal 2025, Adobe projects total revenues between $5.63 billion and $5.68 billion. The company expects non-GAAP earnings between $4.95 per share and $5 per share.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.65 billion, suggesting growth of 9.11% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged at $4.97 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 10.94% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nADBE's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 2.59%.\n\nLet us see how things have shaped up for ADBE shares prior to this announcement.\n\nADBE's Q1 Segmental View is Encouraging\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Adobe expects Digital Media segment revenues between $4.17 billion and $4.2 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Digital Media segment revenues is pegged at $4.18 billion, suggesting a 9.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for Creative Cloud revenues stands at $3.33 billion, indicating 8.5% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud's consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $855 million, implying 14% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nDigital Experience segment revenues are anticipated to be $1.38-$1.40 billion.

The deep integration of these models into Adobe's tools, such as Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere, InDesign and Express, has improved the experiences for creative professionals globally. Firefly generations now have crossed 16 billion cumulative generations.",

Google stock was indicated slightly lower Sunday night.\n\nThe Department of Justice late Friday afternoon again proposed that Google be forced to sell its web browser Chrome.\n\nThe Biden administration last year asked a federal judge to order Alphabet to sell its Chrome browser and end internet search-related payments to Apple (AAPL) as part of antitrust legal remedies.\n\nIn a filing Friday, the DOJ reiterated those proposals. However, the DOJ backed away from requiring Google to divest investments in artificial intelligence. Google has invested billions of dollars in startup Anthropic, for example.\n\n\"Google's illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\" the DOJ said in the filing\n\nFederal judge Amit Mehta in August ruled that Alphabet illegally maintained a monopoly over online search services and prevented rivals from developing their own products.\n\nMehta is expected to hear oral arguments on proposed remedies in April and rule by early August.\n\nMeanwhile, another government antitrust lawsuit versus Google is going forward.\n\nThe DOJ claims Google's dominance of the digital ad market has damaged advertisers and content creators. Some analysts call it the \"DoubleClick trial.\" In 2008, Google acquired leading digital advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.\n\nA ruling is expected in the spring. It's still possible the Trump administration and Alphabet could agree to a settlement.\n\nGoogle Stock Technical Data\n\nOn the stock market today, Google stock fell 4.5% to close at 165.87 as the Nasdaq also tumbled.\n\nGoogle stock has retreated 8% in 2025. Shares rose 2.1% last week, ending a four-week slide. They are slightly below Alphabet's 200-day moving average.\n\nGoogle stock holds a Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nLearn The Best Trading Stock Rules From IBD's Investor's Corner\n\nWant To Trade Options?

Each segment is made up of autonomous teams, many of which are headed by their own CEOs and executive leadership. This structure lets each subsidiary operate like an emerging company\u2014much faster than a larger and often slower enterprise, but with the resources of a mature corporation. The strategy behind Alphabet\u2019s segmentation In addition to organizing its various initiatives, Alphabet\u2019s segmentation provides a number of key advantages: Risk management. By separating each subsidiary\u2019s operational structure and brand identity, Alphabet can pursue riskier ventures while shielding each subsidiary and its core brand from reputational risk in the event of controversy or failure.\n\nBy separating each subsidiary\u2019s operational structure and brand identity, Alphabet can pursue riskier ventures while shielding each subsidiary and its core brand from reputational risk in the event of controversy or failure. Business transparency. Alphabet\u2019s business segmentation made it easier for investors and analysts to evaluate the financial results of the company\u2019s various ventures. For example, investors can clearly distinguish its search and advertising segment\u2019s performance from those of its YouTube, enterprise cloud, and self-driving cars segments. Alphabet reports its revenue and earnings on a consolidated basis, but it also provides a separate breakdown of financial results for its various subsidiaries, making it easier for people to track the progress of Alphabet\u2019s distinct ventures.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s business segmentation made it easier for investors and analysts to evaluate the financial results of the company\u2019s various ventures.

Focus. By operating with a more autonomous leadership structure, Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries can focus on their specific missions with greater efficiency and fewer \u201ctop-down\u201d operational constraints and other comparable bureaucratic bottlenecks typical of larger corporations. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s core segments can continue to focus on their legacy services and primary revenue drivers. Overall, the creation of Alphabet was a strategic move to allow Google and its various other ventures to operate in their respective domains effectively and simultaneously with greater transparency, maximum efficiency, and minimal risk exposure.\n\nWhat do you think?

A move partly inspired by Warren Buffett\u2019s investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), the creation of a holding company would restructure Google and its various other businesses as subsidiaries of Alphabet Inc., now the parent company. This allowed the various departments that weren\u2019t directly related to Google\u2019s main Internet services to spin off into their own subcompanies within the same business umbrella. Sundar Pichai, who was originally Google\u2019s product chief, was named Google\u2019s new CEO, while Brin and Page managed Alphabet as its president and CEO, respectively.

Therefore, advance notification is required to permit a review of proposed transactions.\n\nThe DOJ remained firm on its call for the divestment of the Chrome browser and a slew of other measures to prevent Alphabet from monopolizing the search business.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct presents genuine danger to freedom in the marketplace and to robust competition in our economy,\u201d the regulator said. The DOJ attorneys said the core components of the IPFJ remain unchanged.\n\nThe IPFJ filed in November required that Google stop making search-related payments to its search distribution partners such as Apple, Inc. (AAPL), divest Chrome on the premise that the browser is a critical search access point through which more than 30% of search inquiries are routed and also a contingent Android divestiture at the election of Google or the court.\n\nA Bloomberg report said last week that representatives for the Google parent met with officials of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to urge them to back down on the DOJ call to break up the company .\n\nJudge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia, who is hearing the case, will make a final decision in April.\n\nOn Stocktwits, retail sentiment toward Alphabet stock remained \u2018neutral\u2019 (45/100), with the muted sentiment accompanied by \u2018low\u2019 message volume.\n\nDelving into the final proposals submitted by the DOJ, a bearish watcher said AI search may not save the business.\n\nBut another watcher asked fellow retail traders to accumulate at current levels on the premise that Alphabet is the most undervalued \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock.\n\nAlphabet stock ended Friday\u2019s session up 0.88% at $173.86.

            "content": "House Republicans have subpoenaed Google parent Alphabet for records related to alleged censorship of YouTube content by the Biden administration.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, \"continues to investigate how and to what extent the Biden-Harris Administration coerced or colluded with companies and other intermediaries, including Alphabet, to censor lawful speech.\"\n\nIn his letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Jordan alleges that the federal government pressured YouTube to censor certain lawful content, including material \"that did not violate YouTube's content moderation policies.\"\n\nAt issue are Biden administration efforts to alert social media services about misinformation on their platforms, particularly as it pertained to the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine. Republicans argue this amounts to censorship, and shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order aimed at \"restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship,\" arguing that the Biden administration used the pretense of \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" to infringe on free speech rights.\n\nHowever, last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House is allowed to contact social media companies about content they believe could be harmful, as long as they don't force companies to remove it.\n\nIn August, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the House Judiciary Committee that he thought \"pressure [from the Biden administration] was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.\" However, he acknowledged that \"ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions.\"\n\nJordan points to Zuckerberg's statement in his letter to Pichai. \"Alphabet, to our knowledge, has not similarly disavowed the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s attempts to censor speech,\" he says. \"To inform legislative reforms to protect Americans\u2019 civil liberties, the Committee must fully understand the extent and nature of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s censorship efforts.\"\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Google says it will \"continue to show the committee how we enforce our policies independently, rooted in our commitment to free expression.\"\n\nMeta, meanwhile, has cozied up to Trump since November, getting rid of formal fact checkers in favor of the Community Notes model used on X. The company donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund and Zuckerberg attended the inauguration. (Google and Pichai did the same.)",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

Although the Google parent continues to outperform the S&P 500, some wonder whether it has lost a step in the artificial intelligence (AI) race as chipmakers like Nvidia and stocks more closely linked to OpenAI's ChatGPT draw more attention.\n\nStill, amid this confusion, Alphabet has become the cheapest stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" as measured by its P/E ratio of 21. Moreover, the company continues to make moves showing it remains relevant in AI, and its investments could mean its stock price doubles (or more) in the next five years. Here's why.\n\nThe state of Alphabet\n\nIn some ways, the idea of Alphabet being behind in AI may seem surprising. The company first began to utilize this technology in 2001, and leveraged AI to assert early dominance in the digital advertising industry.\n\nThe profits from that business allowed it to invest in other enterprises. Among these investments was the purchase of YouTube in 2006, which became a major source of ad revenue. It also used some of that money to create Google Cloud, which today serves as its primary source of revenue outside of advertising.\n\nAdditionally, it owns numerous other businesses, such as the autonomous driving company Waymo and fitness tracker Fitbit. While Alphabet does not represent these enterprises in its financials, they will likely help it prepare for the day when digital ad revenue will become less critical to the company.\n\nDriving growth\n\nThe one commonality to all of these businesses is AI. To that end, Alphabet announced it would invest $75 billion in capex this year, up from $53 billion in 2024.\n\nWhile that sounds like a staggering sum, it is likely one Alphabet can afford. For one, 2024 revenue rose 14% yearly to $350 billion despite signs the business has matured.\n\nFor all the talk about advertising playing less of a role in the company, Alphabet's revenue surged 11% higher in 2024, representing 76% of total revenue. Since this is down from 77% of the 2023 total, investors should expect it to remain the primary revenue driver for some time to come.\n\nThe main growth driver right now is Google Cloud. Although it makes up only 12% of company revenue, it grew by 31% yearly, meaning the cloud and, by extension, AI has become more important to Alphabet, not less.\n\nMoreover, the company held about $95 billion in liquidity as of the end of 2024. It also generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow in 2024, down slightly from $73 billion in 2023.\n\nIndeed, the company spent more than $62 billion in share repurchases in 2024 and more than $7 billion in dividend payments. Hence, some of its spending priorities may have to shift over time to bankroll the $75 billion in capex spending. Still, this shows that Alphabet can maintain this pace of investment in the near term, especially if investments bear fruit in the form of increased free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, the stock is up by nearly 150% over the last five years. That includes an increase of around 45% since OpenAI released GPT-4o in May 2023. Amid Alphabet's work to advance AI, investors should expect the stock to stay on a positive growth trajectory, making a 100% gain in five years an achievable goal.\n\nAlphabet in five years\n\nGiven the Google parent's existing technology and investment priorities, Alphabet stock should at least double over the next five years.\n\nThe competitive threat from ChatGPT has forced investors to rethink Alphabet's value proposition, and the $75 billion in plans to spend on capex this year may appear unsustainable.\n\nWhile Alphabet has spent heavily, its continuing success in digital advertising and investments in technology have long made it a tech leader. The added spending should increase free cash flow and keep Alphabet competitive and its business growth in a virtuous cycle.\n\nWhen also factoring in its low P/E ratio, Alphabet remains in a strong position to deliver outsized growth and double an investor's position in five years or less.",

Still, this shows that Alphabet can maintain this pace of investment in the near term, especially if investments bear fruit in the form of increased free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, the stock is up by nearly 150% over the last five years. That includes an increase of around 45% since OpenAI released GPT-4o in May 2023. Amid Alphabet's work to advance AI, investors should expect the stock to stay on a positive growth trajectory, making a 100% gain in five years an achievable goal.\n\nAlphabet in five years\n\nGiven the Google parent's existing technology and investment priorities, Alphabet stock should at least double over the next five years.\n\nThe competitive threat from ChatGPT has forced investors to rethink Alphabet's value proposition, and the $75 billion in plans to spend on capex this year may appear unsustainable.\n\nWhile Alphabet has spent heavily, its continuing success in digital advertising and investments in technology have long made it a tech leader. The added spending should increase free cash flow and keep Alphabet competitive and its business growth in a virtuous cycle.\n\nWhen also factoring in its low P/E ratio, Alphabet remains in a strong position to deliver outsized growth and double an investor's position in five years or less.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "So, investors need to recognize that Google Search, a $200 billion-a-year business, is still growing strongly, even with the rise of new AI platforms. In fact, Alphabet has managed to turn the AI challenge into an opportunity. The company has invested billions in developing its own AI, and it\u2019s now using its own tools to benefit its business\u2014whether it\u2019s for coding, automating processes, or improving efficiency.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Alphabet is primarily ad-driven, with Google Search accounting for 56% of its revenues in Q4 2024. While Google Cloud has been the focus of Alphabet\u2019s growth story lately, some investors seem to overlook that Q4 still marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit annual growth for the Search segment, with revenues up 12.5% year-over-year, despite a slight slowdown from the first two-quarters of FY2024.\n\nStarting with Search, the rise of AI has raised concerns about how it could impact Google\u2019s search business, especially with the emergence of LLM models like ChatGPT. The initial worry was that users might start searching more on these platforms to get direct answers without the commercial bias and ads, Google is known for.\n\nAt current valuations, Alphabet shares are trading at forward earnings well below their historical average over the last five years and at almost identical levels to September last year, which was the previous price bottom before a strong rally until early February. So, assuming no significant structural changes to Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals or growth story, this could be a solid buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nIn addition, news hot on the wire suggests that Alphabet\u2019s co-founder Larry Page is setting up a new AI firm called Dynatomics , aiming to \u201crevolutionize manufacturing.\u201d\n\nAs a long-term Alphabet bull, I believe these concerns are short-term issues. Alphabet\u2019s Search segment continues to grow at double-digit rates, benefiting from AI trends rather than being hurt by them. Meanwhile, the slowdown in Google Cloud growth doesn\u2019t impact margin gains, which should be the primary growth engine for the company\u2019s bottom line for years to come.\n\nSince early February, when Google-parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) reported its Q4 results , the stock has been treading water, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (SPY), and struggling to register new highs. The main concerns currently weighing on Alphabet investors boil down to a potential slowdown in the company\u2019s primary revenue driver, Google Search, and sluggish growth in Google Cloud, supposedly its fastest-growing segment.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet\u2019s management also pointed out that they recently launched advertising within AI overviews on mobile in the U.S., building on their previous efforts with ads above and below AI overviews. The key takeaway is that monetization from these ads is happening at roughly the same rate as it did with regular Google search results. While there\u2019s still room for further innovation, it\u2019s clear that Google Search is countering the AI threat and using it to its advantage\u2014continuing to grow by double digits.\n\nUnpacking the Growth Slowdown in Google Cloud\n\nAnother point of skepticism that came up after Alphabet\u2019s Q4 earnings report is the slowdown in Google Cloud\u2019s growth. The sales growth rate has dropped for the first time since Q2 2023, falling from 35% in Q3 to 30% in Q4.\n\nAlthough the segment still hit new all-time high revenues, Google Cloud remains far behind in market share. It holds about 12% of the global cloud market, compared to Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) AWS with 30% and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure with 21% (which grew 31% last quarter). This slowdown was concerning for a company that had been growing faster to catch up with its peers.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) estimated and reported revenue history\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Google Cloud consists of both Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\u2014Alphabet\u2019s core cloud services\u2014and Google Workspace. According to Alphabet\u2019s management, GCP has been growing much faster than the overall cloud segment\u2014over 30%. This means GCP has been growing faster than AWS, especially Azure last quarter.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Margins and Custom Chip Strategic Edge\n\nOne of Google Cloud\u2019s standout accomplishments recently was a noticeable increase in operating margins in Q4. Google Cloud posted a margin of 19% in Q4, a significant jump from 11% in Q3, though still far behind the impressive 37% margin reported by AWS in the same quarter.\n\nThat said, there are strong reasons to believe that Google Cloud\u2019s margins could continue to rise, potentially surpassing its competitors in the near future. One major factor is Alphabet\u2019s growing reliance on its own chips for internal workloads, like running Google Search and other services.\n\nTo avoid being too dependent on Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) GPUs, Alphabet has ramped up production of its own custom chip, called Trillium, which is a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The sixth generation of Google\u2019s TPU, which is known for its improved performance, delivers four times better training performance and three times greater inference throughput compared to the previous version. It\u2019s important to note that Alphabet does not necessarily compete directly with Nvidia regarding efficiency. But, it\u2019s providing a more cost-effective option for businesses that need cloud computing power but don\u2019t require Nvidia\u2019s top-tier performance. This gives Alphabet a low-cost solution, which could be a significant advantage in the long run.\n\nWhile Alphabet doesn\u2019t share detailed comparisons between TPU adoption and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, it\u2019s clear that Google is positioning itself firmly in the custom silicon (own specialized chips) race alongside its main hyperscaler competitors.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s independence from other Big Tech companies can be seen as a competitive edge. It allows the company greater control over its AI infrastructure, resulting in better price-to-performance ratios for its cloud services. In turn, this could lead to gaining market share and also boost operating margins.\n\nIs Alphabet a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOverall, Wall Street analysts have a bullish outlook on GOOGL stock. Out of the 37 analysts covering the stock in the past three months, 26 recommend a Buy, while 11 suggest a Hold. Not a single analyst recommends Selling GOOGL stock. The average price target for GOOGL stock is $215.56 per share, which implies an upside potential of 25% from the current price.\n\nGOOGL\u2019s Growth Story Is Far from Over\n\nOver the past twelve months, investors who took advantage of Alphabet stock trading below its 20x forward earnings have done well, as the stock has rapidly rebounded from those lows. In my opinion, the overly pessimistic reaction after Q4\u2014especially regarding Search\u2014doesn\u2019t match reality.\n\nDespite Search still growing at double digits and Google Cloud\u2019s growth slowing down, the slowdown isn\u2019t due to a lack of demand. It\u2019s more about supply constraints, and the long road ahead for consistent market share growth and higher margins in the cloud business is what investors should focus on. I believe this is another excellent opportunity to go long on GOOGL stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

GOOG GOOGL, the parent company of Google, which owns YouTube, demanding it turn over communications with the executive branch regarding content moderation and alleged government pressure to censor speech.\n\nWhat Happened: House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the subpoena requesting Alphabet's internal communications with the current and previous administrations, as well as with third-party groups working with the federal government, reported The Hill.\n\n\"The Committee's oversight has revealed that YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet, was a direct participant in the federal government's censorship regime,\" Jordan wrote in a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nJordan cited emails between Google and the White House in 2021 concerning COVID-19 misinformation, stating that government officials pressured tech platforms to remove certain content.\n\nHe argued that the subpoena was necessary to help develop legislation limiting the executive branch's ability to influence content decisions on social media platforms.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda responded, stating, \"We will continue to show the committee how we enforce our policies independently, rooted in our commitment to free expression.\"\n\nLast year, Meta Platforms Inc. META CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, his company experienced pressure from top officials in the Joe Biden administration to restrict certain content on its platforms.\n\nZuckerberg also stated that he would oppose any similar pressures in the future.\n\n\"Alphabet, to our knowledge, has not similarly disavowed the Biden-Harris Administration's attempts to censor speech,\" Jordan said in his letter on Thursday.\n\nSee Also: Google's Chrome Changes Disable uBlock Origin For Even More Users \u2014Can You Still Block Ads?\n\nWhy It's Important: The subpoena issued to Alphabet is part of a broader scrutiny of tech companies\u2019 relationships with the government.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta also decided to shift toward a Community Notes-style content moderation system, resembling the method used by Elon Musk\u2019s X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe transition was viewed as part of big tech companies' attempt to build ties with the Donald Trump administration. For instance, several major U.S. corporations including Meta, Target Corp, and McDonald's have ended their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program following former Trump\u2019s call to eliminate \u201cillegal preferences.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has also intensified its call to break up Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, advocating for the sale of Chrome and imposing limits on its search operations.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares dipped 0.086% in after-hours trading to $173.71, while Class C shares fell 0.023% to $175.71.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Criticizes Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to warn users to not trust billionaires. His remarks built on an earlier show, where he had shared that \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Cramer outlined that billionaires often share the sentiment that it\u2019s hard for others to become as rich as they are. \u201cThey close the door,\u201d he commented and added: \u201cWell they\u2019re always negative.\u201d Cramer also believes that luck might play a large role in making someone a billionaire. According to him: \u201cWe never, we never grade them because if they\u2019re billionaires we think that they have to be genius. We never think about luck. We just think, well they might have had really great trade.\u201d\n\nIn response, co-host David Faber pointed out that the one key trait that he has observed in most billionaires is their relentless drive. Cramer responded by sharing that billionaires are \u201ctiresome.\u201d He also felt that President Biden\u2019s goodbye speech about oligarchs was \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, Cramer also commented on how using ChatGPT was proving troublesome. He outlined:\n\n\u201cI use ChatGPT like, probably maybe fifty times a day. I do it text and I\u2019m continually let down by the lack of rigor of what I get. I mean I\u2019ll say tell me everything I need to know about [a pharma company \u2013 BMY]. And it won\u2019t even have the patent cliff. Doesn\u2019t mention the patent. . . I mean it just doesn\u2019t get the story at all.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 26th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "Since early February, when Google-parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) reported its Q4 results, the stock has been treading water, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (SPY), and struggling to register new highs. The main concerns currently weighing on Alphabet investors boil down to a potential slowdown in the company\u2019s primary revenue driver, Google Search, and sluggish growth in Google Cloud, supposedly its fastest-growing segment.\n\nAs a long-term Alphabet bull, I believe these concerns are short-term issues. Alphabet\u2019s Search segment continues to grow at double-digit rates, benefiting from AI trends rather than being hurt by them. Meanwhile, the slowdown in Google Cloud growth doesn\u2019t impact margin gains, which should be the primary growth engine for the company\u2019s bottom line for years to come.\n\nIn addition, news hot on the wire suggests that Alphabet\u2019s co-founder Larry Page is setting up a new AI firm called Dynatomics, aiming to \u201crevolutionize manufacturing.\u201d\n\nAt current valuations, Alphabet shares are trading at forward earnings well below their historical average over the last five years and at almost identical levels to September last year, which was the previous price bottom before a strong rally until early February. So, assuming no significant structural changes to Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals or growth story, this could be a solid buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nGoogle Search Embraces AI\n\nStarting with Search, the rise of AI has raised concerns about how it could impact Google\u2019s search business, especially with the emergence of LLM models like ChatGPT. The initial worry was that users might start searching more on these platforms to get direct answers without the commercial bias and ads, Google is known for.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Alphabet is primarily ad-driven, with Google Search accounting for 56% of its revenues in Q4 2024. While Google Cloud has been the focus of Alphabet\u2019s growth story lately, some investors seem to overlook that Q4 still marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit annual growth for the Search segment, with revenues up 12.5% year-over-year, despite a slight slowdown from the first two-quarters of FY2024.\n\nSo, investors need to recognize that Google Search, a $200 billion-a-year business, is still growing strongly, even with the rise of new AI platforms. In fact, Alphabet has managed to turn the AI challenge into an opportunity. The company has invested billions in developing its own AI, and it\u2019s now using its own tools to benefit its business\u2014whether it\u2019s for coding, automating processes, or improving efficiency.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s management also pointed out that they recently launched advertising within AI overviews on mobile in the U.S., building on their previous efforts with ads above and below AI overviews. The key takeaway is that monetization from these ads is happening at roughly the same rate as it did with regular Google search results. While there\u2019s still room for further innovation, it\u2019s clear that Google Search is countering the AI threat and using it to its advantage\u2014continuing to grow by double digits.\n\nUnpacking the Growth Slowdown in Google Cloud\n\nAnother point of skepticism that came up after Alphabet\u2019s Q4 earnings report is the slowdown in Google Cloud\u2019s growth. The sales growth rate has dropped for the first time since Q2 2023, falling from 35% in Q3 to 30% in Q4.\n\nAlthough the segment still hit new all-time high revenues, Google Cloud remains far behind in market share. It holds about 12% of the global cloud market, compared to Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) AWS with 30% and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure with 21% (which grew 31% last quarter). This slowdown was concerning for a company that had been growing faster to catch up with its peers.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Google Cloud consists of both Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\u2014Alphabet\u2019s core cloud services\u2014and Google Workspace. According to Alphabet\u2019s management, GCP has been growing much faster than the overall cloud segment\u2014over 30%. This means GCP has been growing faster than AWS, especially Azure last quarter.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Margins and Custom Chip Strategic Edge\n\nOne of Google Cloud\u2019s standout accomplishments recently was a noticeable increase in operating margins in Q4. Google Cloud posted a margin of 19% in Q4, a significant jump from 11% in Q3, though still far behind the impressive 37% margin reported by AWS in the same quarter.\n\nThat said, there are strong reasons to believe that Google Cloud\u2019s margins could continue to rise, potentially surpassing its competitors in the near future. One major factor is Alphabet\u2019s growing reliance on its own chips for internal workloads, like running Google Search and other services.\n\nTo avoid being too dependent on Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) GPUs, Alphabet has ramped up production of its own custom chip, called Trillium, which is a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The sixth generation of Google\u2019s TPU, which is known for its improved performance, delivers four times better training performance and three times greater inference throughput compared to the previous version. It\u2019s important to note that Alphabet does not necessarily compete directly with Nvidia regarding efficiency. But, it\u2019s providing a more cost-effective option for businesses that need cloud computing power but don\u2019t require Nvidia\u2019s top-tier performance. This gives Alphabet a low-cost solution, which could be a significant advantage in the long run.\n\nWhile Alphabet doesn\u2019t share detailed comparisons between TPU adoption and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, it\u2019s clear that Google is positioning itself firmly in the custom silicon (own specialized chips) race alongside its main hyperscaler competitors.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s independence from other Big Tech companies can be seen as a competitive edge. It allows the company greater control over its AI infrastructure, resulting in better price-to-performance ratios for its cloud services. In turn, this could lead to gaining market share and also boost operating margins.\n\nIs Alphabet a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOverall, Wall Street analysts have a bullish outlook on GOOGL stock. Out of the 37 analysts covering the stock in the past three months, 26 recommend a Buy, while 11 suggest a Hold. Not a single analyst recommends Selling GOOGL stock. The average price target for GOOGL stock is $215.56 per share, which implies an upside potential of 25% from the current price.\n\nGOOGL\u2019s Growth Story Is Far from Over\n\nOver the past twelve months, investors who took advantage of Alphabet stock trading below its 20x forward earnings have done well, as the stock has rapidly rebounded from those lows. In my opinion, the overly pessimistic reaction after Q4\u2014especially regarding Search\u2014doesn\u2019t match reality.\n\nDespite Search still growing at double digits and Google Cloud\u2019s growth slowing down, the slowdown isn\u2019t due to a lack of demand. It\u2019s more about supply constraints, and the long road ahead for consistent market share growth and higher margins in the cloud business is what investors should focus on. I believe this is another excellent opportunity to go long on GOOGL stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

That\u2019s what the House Judiciary Committee, led by Republican Chairman Jim Jordan, wants to figure out. The officials have subpoenaed Alphabet to discuss communications between the company and the Biden administration related to content moderation practices.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s content moderation practices\n\nThe Trump administration and other Republicans claim that Alphabet, along with other tech giants, has suppressed conservative viewpoints under the pretense of content moderation. This subpoena wants to uncover conversations around politically sensitive topics, including moderation decisions linked to former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nMeta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg admitted to Jordan\u2019s House panel last year that the Biden administration had pressured it to censor content, potentially fueling the notion that Alphabet and other tech companies have been playing favorites. Meta later agreed to dial back on its content moderation practices early this year in January.\n\nHowever, Alphabet\u2019s lack of admission did not sit well with Jordan, who, in his letter to the company, said, \u201cAlphabet, to our knowledge, has not similarly disavowed the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s attempts to censor speech.\u201d\n\nGoogle has defended its content moderation practices. In a statement made by Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda, he said that the company will \u201ccontinue to show the committee how we enforce our policies independently, rooted in our commitment to free expression.\u201d\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nNow, whether or not Alphabet and Big Tech have been playing favorites is one thing. The bigger picture here is that it underscores transparency when it comes to moderation in politics. It also sets a precedent for how regulators and future administrations might want to regulate tech companies further, especially when it comes to politics.\n\nDespite this, big tech companies appear to be more cooperative with the Trump administration. President Trump has been aggressively pushing for tariffs on imported goods from countries such as China. Many tech companies, such as Apple, rely heavily on China. This is why some of these firms have been making moves that attempt to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces. This includes hundreds of billions of dollars worth of investments in the US company.",

The company states this new iteration is equipped to handle complex queries more effectively, thanks to its enhanced reasoning capabilities. \"The AI Mode is not just about search; it\u2019s about redefining user interaction by offering concise information quickly,\" said Alphabet's spokesperson.\n\nUsers subscribed to Google One can access this AI Mode through the search results page by simply clicking on the tab titled \"AI Mode,\" positioned alongside options like maps and images. This development is emblematic of the tech giant's commitment to improving the user experience through cutting-edge technology.\n\nBut Alphabet isn't the only company making waves. A new AI search engine, Exa.ai, has emerged, boasting the ability to rapidly sift through vast amounts of information and deliver relevant topic summaries. This platform takes user queries and aims to provide more than just links. It offers detailed results, sometimes surpassing 10 million, based on parameters such as date, location, and subject matter.\n\n\"Exa.ai exemplifies how AI is reshaping the way we interact with information online,\" notes tech expert Jamila Newhouse. \"It understands user intent more effectively, primarily because it processes contextual information, which traditional search engines often overlook. With capabilities to filter results based on relayed specifications, users can enjoy enhanced efficiency and relevance.\"\n\nNot to be left out, Brave Leo AI, another integrated AI assistant, promotes quicker and more efficient research abilities. This service allows users to conduct searches across various platforms, enabling the seamless gathering of information without having to leave the working page. Offered at $15 for professional use, it includes features such as content translation and rephrasing capabilities, allowing for optimal user engagement.\n\n\"The future of search is not merely about finding links but creating meaningful interactions with the content presented,\" remarked tech analyst Kevin Smith. \"Technologies like Brave Leo AI and Exa.ai are not just advantageous; they're becoming necessary for effectively handling the digital glut of information.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Qatari efforts reflect the nation\u2019s growing interest and investments in technological advancements. Recently, Qatar Airways showcased competitive flight offers to various destinations, aiming to boost tourism and engage potential travelers. Such moves indicate the airline\u2019s strategic importance to the national economy, especially as global travel begins to rebound more sharply post-pandemic.\n\nConcurrently, the Qatari government is introducing support measures for its citizens, with the Ministry of Social Development and Family offering refunds for housing loans to citizens supporting their families. This initiative exemplifies the government's commitment to social welfare and community development, allowing families to apply for assistance through convenient online services.\n\nResidents can also benefit from Hamad Medical Corporation's initiative to renew health cards with ease. By streamlining this process, the organization demonstrates its focus on ensuring citizens' access to healthcare, particularly during challenging times.\n\nThe emphasis on technology within Qatar is underscored by increased investments aimed at fostering innovative projects. The Investor website has reported consistent interest from both local and international financiers eager to engage with the country\u2019s burgeoning tech ecosystem. \"Qatar's position as a leader within tech investment shouldn't be underestimated,\" asserted the report, highlighting how the nation is positioning itself to attract leading tech firms and entrepreneurs.\n\nSupporting these flourishing tech initiatives, Msheireb Properties has adopted the role of incubator for entrepreneurial ventures, showcasing various events focused on creativity and investment opportunities within the sustainable real estate sector. Such efforts reinforce Qatar\u2019s strategic vision to promote sustainable development and promote local talent.\n\nOn the cultural front, as Ramadan approaches, Qatar is gearing up for diverse family events, including food festivals and artistic exhibitions. These local celebrations reflect not only the cultural richness of the nation but also serve as economic drivers, encouraging community gathering and engagement.\n\nWhile traditional search engines still hold significant ground, the rise of AI-driven options has ignited discussions about the future. Innovative platforms like Alphabet's Gemini 2.0, Exa.ai, and Brave Leo AI promise to redefine internet searching, thereby improving user experiences and engagements with information.\n\nWith initiatives to support citizens and promote technological advancements, Qatar is evidently setting itself on the path to becoming a global hub for both technology and social welfare. The interplay between AI and community-focused services may well shape the narrative of the region as it moves forward.",

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) is well established as a tech leader and is one of the most valuable companies in the world. However, the stock is still vulnerable to the same kinds of macro-level risks as the rest of the stock market, and in February, a combination of weaker-than-expected revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings report and broader worries around the global economy sent the stock tumbling. By the end of the month, Alphabet had lost 17%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, erasing more than $300 billion in market value from the company.\n\nAs the chart below shows, the stock fell early in the month on the earnings report and at the end of February as part of a broader sell-off in the market.\n\nQ4 results underwhelm\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 12% to $96.47 billion, though that was below estimates at $96.67 billion. It was also notably slower than rival Meta Platforms' growth, showing that the Google parent appears to be losing market share to its largest digital advertising competitor. The figure also represented a slowdown from earlier in the year.\n\nOn the bottom line, earnings per share rose from $1.64 to $2.15, which was slightly ahead of the consensus at $2.13.\n\nAlphabet doesn't give full guidance, but investors seemed skeptical about its plans to ramp up capital expenditures to $75 billion in 2025 from $52.4 billion in 2024 to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as it's not clear that that's currently driving significant revenue for the company.\n\nLater in the month, Alphabet pulled back again in line with a broader sell-off in the market on macro and tech sector issues. Tech stocks fell on reports that Microsoft was canceling some data center leases, and after Nvidia stock sold off in spite of solid earnings report, indicating that investors may believe that AI stocks had gotten overvalued.\n\nAdditionally, tariff threats seemed to push stock lower. Google also announced job cuts in its cloud division, which could improve profits, but may also be a sign of slowing growth.\n\nWhat's next for Alphabet\n\nAs the leader in digital advertising, Alphabet is sensitive to global economic growth and business spending, and in a recession, companies tend to cut back on advertising spending first so investors should expect the stock to move on macro news.\n\nAdditionally, while the company has stood its ground in the AI race, there is still some concern that its search leadership is vulnerable to competition from OpenAI and others.\n\nHowever, those concerns seem priced in and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.5. If Alphabet can maintain its current growth rate, the stock should move higher from here.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.",

The new tool is called \u201cAI Mode\u201d and is available only to Google One AI Premium users for now. Google said that it is \u201ctesting\u201d the experimental version of its new search engine, which completely removes the classic 10 blue links and instead generates an AI summary for the query.\n\nGoogle Powers AI Search with Gemini 2.0\n\nGoogle said that the AI Mode is powered by a custom version of its advanced Gemini 2.0 model to help users find answers to the most difficult questions, related to coding, math, and multimodal queries. Google\u2019s VP of Product, Robby Stein said that Google\u2019s premium users want to find more AI-generated responses for their queries, prompting Google to launch the AI Mode. The new feature can be seen on the results page of any search query.\n\nGoogle One AI Premium Users can click on the tab named \u201cAI Mode\u201d found next to existing options such as Images and Maps to start using the tool. The Google One AI Premium feature costs $19.99 per month and provides extra cloud storage facilities and allows access to some of Google\u2019s premium AI tools.\n\nThis testing phase will help Google gather reasonable feedback on the quality and helpfulness of the AI Mode. Currently, the model could throw traditional webpage links instead of a comprehensive AI Overview in cases where it is not fully confident of the output. Some responses could also reflect personal opinions. The tech giant will continue to improve the AI Mode with the feedback and keep updating it with new capabilities and features, including image and video responses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s AI Overviews Expands to More Users\n\nGoogle had already started testing AI Overviews in the U.S. in May 2024. AI Overviews are summaries that appear on top of the search results, followed by the traditional blue links to relevant websites and sources. With the new AI Mode, users can see a more detailed AI summary with hyperlinks to referenced webpages. Additionally, users can see a search bar to ask follow-up questions instead of the 10 blue links. Google also said that it is rolling out AI Overviews to more people and even teens can now access them, without having the need to sign-in.\n\nIs Google a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nWall Street remains divided on Alphabet\u2019s stock trajectory, especially since Google has already gained 32.2% in the past year. On TipRanks, GOOGL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. The average Alphabet Class A price target of $215.56 implies 24.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other good stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhen seeking investment opportunities, individual investors often look to hedge funds for guidance. Hedge funds are known for their sophisticated investment strategies, high-level expertise, and significant market influence. Hedge funds are massive players in the global investment landscape, managing trillions of dollars in assets. According to Preqin, as of Q3 2024, hedge funds manage approximately $4.87 trillion in assets globally. This significant amount of capital means that hedge funds have substantial market power. When they invest in certain stocks, their actions can impact stock prices, drive market trends, and influence broader economic sentiment. As such, their decisions are followed closely by institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nA key reason hedge fund stock picks are worth paying attention to is their wide diversification across various sectors and strategies. Multi-strategy hedge funds, which allocate capital across various investment strategies, have gained prominence. According to WealthBriefing from 2017 to the third quarter of 2024, the number of multi-strategy fund launches grew at an annual rate of 4%.\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 Dual Investment Strategy (Long and Short Positions)\n\nHedge funds are also known for using a dual approach\u2014investing in both long and short positions. This allows them to profit from rising and falling markets, giving them a comprehensive view of market dynamics. According to data from BarclayHedge, hedge funds that employed a long/short strategy in 2024 saw returns of around 9%.\n\n\u200bHedge funds have increasingly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sectors, adjusting their portfolios to capitalize on emerging opportunities. According to a Goldman Sachs report analyzing 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion in gross equity positions at the start of Q1 2025, there has been a notable shift in investment strategies. The report indicates that hedge funds have become more selective within popular sectors and themes. Notably, they have incrementally added positions to AI Phase 3 companies with AI-enabled revenues. Companies like Salesforce are ranked among the \u201cRising Stars,\u201d reflecting a significant increase in hedge fund popularity during the last quarter. \u200b\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a consensus-based approach by using opinions from financial websites like Forbes Advisor, Motley Fool, and Morningstar to first compile a list of good stocks to invest in right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNo of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a global technology company that provides a wide range of products and services across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Latin America. Operating through three main segments\u2014Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets\u2014the company offers popular platforms such as Search, YouTube, Android, Google Maps, and Google Play.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is doubling down on its AI-driven growth strategy with a $75 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, prioritizing investments in technical infrastructure, including servers and data centers. This aggressive spending underscores the company\u2019s commitment to scaling AI capabilities and meeting surging demand for AI-powered services. In tandem with these investments, the company is also restructuring its Cloud division, cutting fewer than 100 positions in sales operations. This was done to streamline resources toward AI and other high-priority growth areas.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) delivered a strong Q4 2024 performance, with revenues rising 12% YoY to $96.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth in Google Services up 10% and Google Cloud up 30%. Operating income surged 31% YoY, expanding the operating margin to 32% (up 5 percentage points), highlighting improved efficiency and AI-driven cost optimizations. Net income climbed 28%, while EPS jumped 31% to $2.15, reflecting strong profitability. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized AI innovation as a key growth driver, citing Google Cloud\u2019s AI infrastructure and YouTube\u2019s dominance in streaming.\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of good stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is pleading with the Donald Trump Government to reconsider a decision of breaking up the company, which was passed by the Biden Administration. According to reports, Google\u2019s executives met with Trump\u2019s officials last week, urging them to reverse the course, citing national security concerns and probable harm to the American economy.\n\nThe parent company of the web browser Google Search is facing two massive antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department (DOJ), one related to its illegal dominance in the Search market and the other targeting its monopoly in the online Ad tech market. The DOJ is studying the proposal of breaking up Google by selling its Chrome Browser. Additionally, Google is required to stop paying third party sellers such as Apple (AAPL) for making Google Search their default search engine.\n\nIs Google Scared of Losing its Search Dominance?\n\nIt is likely that Google is scared of losing its large share of the online Search market. Google earns a majority of its revenues from its Google Search business backed by growing advertising revenues. Selling the Chrome Browser will impact Google where it hurts the most.\n\nGoogle lost the landmark antitrust case over its search dominance last august, which was the first leg of the trial. The second leg is where the Judge will give remedial measures to end Google\u2019s alleged search monopoly. The antitrust trial for the same is set for April and both the DOJ and Google are expected to file their final proposals on the case by this Friday. Alphabet is hoping that the Trump administration could be more lenient towards its request than the Biden administration. The final ruling on the case is scheduled for August.\n\nIs Google a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nWall Street remains divided on Alphabet\u2019s stock trajectory currently. On TipRanks, GOOGL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. Also, the average Alphabet Class A price target of $215.56 implies 26.2% upside potential from current levels. In the past year, GOOGL stock has gained 29.3%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom AVGO, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nShould You Add Broadcom Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings This Week?\n\nBroadcom is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 6.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nFor first-quarter fiscal 2025, AVGO expects revenues of $14.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $14.62 billion, suggesting growth of 22.23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged at $1.50 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 22.23% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 3.57%.\n\nBroadcom Inc. price-eps-surprise | Broadcom Inc. Quote\n\nLet us see how things have shaped up for AVGO shares prior to this announcement.\n\nFactors to Note Prior to Broadcom\u2019s Q1 Earnings\n\nBroadcom\u2019s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from its expanding AI and Gen AI offerings. AI revenues are anticipated to jump 65% year over year to $3.8 billion. AI connectivity revenues are likely to be strong in the fiscal first quarter as hyperscalers continue to deploy Jericho. Non-AI semiconductor revenues are expected to decline in the mid-teen percentage on a year-over-year basis.\n\nFor the to-be-reported quarter, semiconductor revenues are anticipated to jump 10% year over year to $8.1 billion. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 11% sequentially and 41% year over year to $6.5 billion. VMware\u2019s annual booking value is expected to surpass $3 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter Semiconductor Solutions revenues are pegged at $8.17 billion, indicating 10.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for Infrastructure Software revenues is pegged at $6.48 billion, indicating 41.8% year-over-year growth.\n\nStrong results at VMware are expected to have driven top-line growth. Broadcom\u2019s focus on shifting VMware products to a subscription-based model is expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nA favorable revenue mix, and higher Infrastructure Software and product revenues within the Semiconductor segment are expected to have driven an expansion of 100 basis points in the gross margin on a sequential basis. Broadcom expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 66% in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAVGO Shares Outperform Sector\n\nIn the trailing 12 months, AVGO shares have returned 42.2%, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s return of 15.1% and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry\u2019s appreciation of 15.2%.\n\nThe AVGO stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales ratio, Broadcom shares are trading at 14.61X, higher than its median of 13.15X and the industry\u2019s 7.45X.\n\nStrong AI Portfolio Aids Broadcom\u2019s Long-Term Prospects\n\nAVGO\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from the growing demand for AI infrastructure and the robust deployment of the GenAI portfolio. A solid portfolio is helping expand clientele that includes Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Its strong partner base, including Arista Networks, Dell Technologies, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst.\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom\u2019s ASICs.\n\nThe acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. Since closing the acquisition, AVGO added more than 4500 of its largest 10,000 customers to VMware Cloud Foundation, which enables enterprises to deploy private cloud environments on-premise.\n\nAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as specific hyperscalers have started to develop their XPUs. Per the company, each of AVGO\u2019s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric by 2027. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected between $60 billion and $90 billion for fiscal 2027 alone.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s focus on reducing its debt is noteworthy. The company paid off $2.81 billion of short-term debt in fiscal 2024, and $1.25 billion is due within the next 12 months. AVGO\u2019s strong cash flow-generating ability is expected to help the company sustain its dividend payout, as well as lower its debt level simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n\nBroadcom\u2019s strong portfolio, along with an expanding partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential over the long run. We believe that these factors justify the premium valuation.\n\nBroadcom currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting that it is the right time to buy the stock ahead of the first-quarter fiscal 2025 results.

            "content": "Alphabet Inc.\u2018s GOOGL GOOG Google is urging the U.S. government to reconsider its antitrust cases, warning that potential breakup proposals could harm the American economy and national security.\n\nWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Justice is currently pursuing two anti-monopoly cases against Google, focusing on search and advertising technology. In a recent meeting with government officials, Google representatives expressed deep concerns about proposed remedies that could significantly alter the company\u2019s operations, Reuters reported, citing sources.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s potential remedies include forcing Google to divest its Chrome Web browser and terminate default search engine agreements with companies like Apple Inc. AAPL. A trial to determine appropriate remedies is scheduled for April, with a final ruling expected in August.\n\nIndustry analysts have mixed reactions to the proposals. Brian Pitz from BMO Capital Markets described the DOJ\u2019s approach as a \u201ckitchen sink moment,\u201d while JPMorgan\u2018s Doug Anmuth suggested the current proposals represent a worst-case scenario for Google.\n\nSee Also: NBA Legend Shaq Says His Net Worth \u2018Quadrupled\u2019 Once He Took Note From Jeff Bezos And Started Investing In Things That \u2018Change People\u2019s Lives\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: The antitrust pressure comes as Google simultaneously navigates significant internal restructuring. The company is implementing layoffs in its human resources and cloud divisions while accelerating investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi has emphasized cost-cutting as a priority, particularly as demand for AI products continues to grow.\n\nComplicating the landscape, potential changes in administration may impact the antitrust approach. President Donald Trump has previously expressed skepticism about breaking up tech companies, suggesting more nuanced regulatory interventions.\n\nPrice Action: Alphabet Inc. Class A shares closed at $170.92 on Tuesday, up 2.34%, and rose another 0.95% after hours to $172.54. Class C shares ended at $172.61, gaining 2.34%, with an additional 0.83% increase to $174.05 after hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

            "content": "A, E, I, O, U\u2026 and sometimes Y. Sometimes. It\u2019s not always a vowel. Some days it is, and some days it isn\u2019t. That can\u2019t be easy, especially when all the other letters and \u201cunits of grammatical organization\u201d are usually as rigid as a frat boy driving through a bikini car wash.\n\nEverybody else has their marching orders. The letter X, for example, knows to wait on the bench until a rare xylophone comes along. There\u2019s no miscommunication, no resentment\u2014the X simply stays hydrated, stays ready, and doesn\u2019t question its importance to the alphabet. The letter K, similarly, has one job and one job only: to keep things hard (not unlike the fellow at the car wash, but totally unlike its flip-flopping wussbag colleague, the letter C). Participles don\u2019t dangle, compound modifiers wouldn\u2019t dream of showing up to the party without their pal, the hyphen, and subjects and verbs know better than to disagree. About anything. Everyone seems to know exactly where they\u2019re supposed to be, who they\u2019re supposed to be, and what they\u2019re supposed to be doing.\n\nThe letter Y? Not so much.\n\nI know the feeling.\n\nDid it ever occur to you, English Language, that maybe the letter Y wants to be just one thing, for a change? Something less complicated, less confused, and less floundering? What the hell is the matter with me? the letter Y might want to scream. Am I a consonant, or am I a vowel? Every other damn letter gets a clear job description. A lane to follow. A place to belong. So why not me? Maybe the letter Y tosses and turns in midlife angst each night, tangling its curlicue tail in the sheets, wondering why it feels so hot one minute and so cold the next.\n\n\n\nIf it does sometimes dissolve into a state of dread and desolation\u2014and I\u2019m not saying it does, but if it does\u2014then the mood probably doesn\u2019t last for long. This is the letter Y, after all. As the previous night\u2019s sleeplessness gives way to a peeking golden sun, I\u2019m guessing that Y wakes to embrace an entirely opposing approach: Hey, why not take on all this uncertainty as a personal challenge? A point of pride? Who wants to be exactly like everyone else?\n\nYou can\u2019t box me into your little\u2026boxes, it might harrumph, wishing it had a pair of arms to fold and a chest to fold them on. You can\u2019t label me. I\u2019m not as simple as all that. Sure, some days I might be all vowelly, all \u2018myth\u2019 and \u2018tryst\u2019 and \u2018sky.\u2019 But that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s all I am. Sometimes I need to be \u2018year,\u201d or \u2018yellow,\u2019 or \u2018yard.\u2019 Or even \u2018papaya,\u2019 goddammit. I\u2019m complex. I contain multitudes. And that\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\n\nOf course it\u2019s okay. Okay, but not always easy. And all that chin-jutting probably gets a little tiring after a while. Sure, change is inevitable. Natural. Yadda, yadda, yadda. No doubt, the letter Y understands that. But maybe, sometimes, it wishes that all the incessant reshuffling could just\u2026slow down. Just a bit. Chances are, it had become happily settled into being a vowel. Chances are, it loved vowelling. And then, suddenly, it gets yanked by the collar into a new and slightly terrifying stage of life: \u201cConsonants needed! Let\u2019s go, Y! You\u2019re up! No more dawdling!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t panic, the letter Y tells itself. This will probably work out fine. And after all, it\u2019s not like I have a choice. \u2018Spy\u2019 and \u2018shy\u2019 and \u2018wry\u2019 were lovely\u2014wonderful, even\u2014but they\u2019re in the past. Now, it\u2019s time to look to the future, to \u2018yak\u2019 and \u2018yarn\u2019 and \u2018yawn.\u2019 And maybe a little \u2018coyote\u2019 and \u2018teriyaki,\u2019 too. That could be interesting, right? Maybe it could even be great.\n\nRight?\n\nYes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. And sometimes no.\n\nT.M.

            "content": "Dublin, March 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Artificial Intelligence in Epidemiology - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Artificial Intelligence in Epidemiology was valued at US$685.6 Million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$2.6 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 25.2% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of epidemiology by enhancing the ability to predict, detect, and manage disease outbreaks. Traditional epidemiological methods, while effective, often struggle to process large volumes of data quickly enough to respond to rapidly evolving health crises. AI addresses this challenge by using advanced machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to analyze vast datasets in real time.\n\n\n\nWhat's Driving the Growth of the AI in Epidemiology Market?\n\n\n\nThe growth in the Artificial Intelligence in Epidemiology market is driven by several key factors, reflecting the increasing reliance on technology to manage public health. The rising prevalence of infectious diseases and the global need for robust surveillance systems are major growth drivers. AI-powered platforms enable real-time monitoring and analysis, providing timely insights that improve outbreak response and disease control.\n\n\n\nTechnological advancements in AI, including natural language processing and deep learning, are further expanding the capabilities of epidemiological tools. These innovations enable the analysis of complex datasets and the generation of actionable insights, driving adoption among health organizations.\n\n\n\nConsumer behavior trends, such as increased use of wearable devices and health apps, are generating valuable real-time health data that supports AI-driven epidemiology. Additionally, government and international funding for AI-based health initiatives are boosting market growth, as public health agencies invest in advanced tools to enhance their capabilities. These factors, coupled with the continuous evolution of AI technologies, are propelling the rapid expansion of the AI in Epidemiology market, positioning it as a cornerstone of modern public health strategy.\n\n\n\nWhat Drives the Adoption of AI in Epidemiology?\n\n\n\nThe increasing frequency and complexity of disease outbreaks are significant drivers of AI adoption in epidemiology. Globalization, urbanization, and climate change are contributing to the spread of infectious diseases, creating an urgent need for advanced tools to monitor and respond to health threats. AI-powered platforms provide real-time surveillance capabilities, ensuring that public health agencies can act swiftly to contain outbreaks.\n\n\n\nThe growing availability of big data is another critical factor. Health organizations now have access to vast amounts of data from EHRs, wearable devices, genomic studies, and social media. AI systems analyze this data to uncover trends and correlations that inform public health strategies. This capability is particularly valuable in understanding the dynamics of emerging diseases and identifying vulnerable populations.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, advancements in AI technologies, such as deep learning and data visualization, are enhancing the accessibility and usability of epidemiological insights. AI tools generate user-friendly reports and visualizations that empower decision-makers at all levels, from local health departments to international organizations like the WHO. These factors highlight the growing importance of AI in addressing the challenges of modern epidemiology.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2024 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of major players such as Alphabet, Inc., Bayer AG, Clarivate Analytics, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, eClinicalWorks LLC and more.\n\nComplimentary Updates: Receive free report updates for one year to keep you informed of the latest market developments.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nMarket Growth: Understand the significant growth trajectory of the Cloud-based Deployment segment, which is expected to reach US$2.1 Billion by 2030 with a CAGR of a 24.7%.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nWith the world making significant strides in artificial intelligence, some countries are concerned about the key figures leading these efforts. In the latest news, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese authorities advised the country\u2019s top artificial intelligence entrepreneurs and researchers to avoid traveling to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, the authorities are concerned that Chinese experts could divulge important and confidential information about the country\u2019s progress. They also fear that they could be detained and used as a \u201cbargaining chip\u201d in US-China negotiations.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now\n\nThe report further revealed that those who decide to travel are instructed to report their plans before leaving. Moreover, they must also report on details like what they did and whom they met upon returning. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng didn\u2019t attend the AI summit in Paris in February, as per the report, while the founder of a major Chinese AI startup also canceled a planned U.S. trip last year, also due to instructions from Beijing.\n\nIn a similar effort, Meta has also fired at least 20 employees who leaked \u201cconfidential information outside the company\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe tell employees when they join the company, and we offer periodic reminders, that it is against our policies to leak internal information, no matter the intent. We recently conducted an investigation that resulted in roughly 20 employees being terminated for sharing confidential information outside the company, and we expect there will be more. We take this seriously, and will continue to take action when we identify leaks.\u201d -Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold tells The Verge exclusively.\n\nMoves like these underscore the importance of privacy and confidentiality, especially in terms of progress in the world of artificial intelligence. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also been instructing top Communist Party officials to improve China\u2019s overall security, particularly in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe should give top priority to defending the country\u2019s political security\u201d. -Xi was quoted as having told other members of the governing Politburo.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses. On February 28, fresh comments from the U.K. watchdog Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) probe into Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) were released. The company is being investigated by the UK competition watchdog over the impact of its search and advertising practices on news publishers, consumers, businesses and competing search engines. Comments on search dominance for Google have been mixed, with some supporting the engine and others viewing it as a problem.\n\nAccording to Yale University Professor Fiona Scott Morton, \u201cGoogle holds a monopoly in general search that is overwhelming and durable.\u201d Consequently, Samsung responded by saying that the CMA\u2019s potential intervention is possibly going to have a significant effect on it and other original equipment manufacturers as well as challenger browsers. The CMA will be using these responses to determine whether Google\u2019s search and advertising search businesses need to come under the scope of the DMCC and whether it must adjust its practices. These include Google requiring to make the data it collects available to other businesses, allowing more control to publishers over how their data is used, including in Google\u2019s artificial intelligence services.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Capital spending by technology giants remains top of mind for investors watching Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (META), Meta Platforms (META) and others. The big question for Google stock: will Alphabet's huge investments pay off?\n\nThe impact of generative artificial intelligence on the internet search advertising business of Google stock also remains a key issue for investors.\n\nA Morgan Stanley analysis on return on investment from big AI investments has mixed news for Alphabet. Morgan Stanley projects that Google will garner $59 billion in generative AI-related in 2028, up from $12 billion in 2024. That's a compound annual growth rate of 49%. While impressive, Morgan Stanley expects Meta to do even better.\n\nMeta's generative AI-related revenue will grow at a 67% CAGR to $101 billion in 2028, up from $13 billion last year, Morgan Stanley predicts.\n\nMeanwhile, antitrust lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice have pressured Google stock. Both Google's internet search and advertising businesses are under DoJ scrutiny.\n\nGoogle stock has retreated about 10% in 2025. Institutional ownership of GOOGL stock has waned.\n\nMeanwhile, Google stock fell on its Q4 earnings report amid higher-than-expected 2025 capital spending.\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon and Meta as well as Microsoft (MSFT) plan to continue high capital spending amid fierce competition in artificial intelligence. The emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek has roiled artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nGoogle Stock: OpenAI Competition\n\nAlso, Google stock has dropped off the IBD Leaderboard. Also, Alphabet's technical ratings have weakened and it continues to under-perform some Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nGenerative AI startup OpenAI's ChatGPT has been slowly gaining search market share. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries while Google's business model has been based on providing web links. Also, startup Perplexity is another new rival.\n\nStartup OpenAI claims that it now serves 400 million weekly active users, up from 300 million in December 2024, reflecting significant acceleration in adoption. While OpenAI has not disclosed figures for paid consumer subscriptions, its enterprise usage figure has doubled since September 2024, reaching 2 million paying business users.\n\nGoogle is competing with OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta and many others in building new foundation models. In December, Google unveiled its new artificial intelligence model, Gemini 2.0.\n\nGoogle began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. In late October, Google launched AI Overviews in 100 countries\n\nThe AI Overviews system uses Google's in-house Gemini AI model. Advertisers utilizing Gemini AI tools see increased traffic and click-through rates, especially among younger demographics, Google says.\n\nIn December, Google announced the Willow quantum computing chip. Google has been a leader in quantum research. But quantum technology faces challenges.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Waymo Expands\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo on Dec. 5 announced that the company plans to expand its autonomous vehicle rideshare service to Miami in 2026. The Waymo One robotaxi service currently operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with upcoming service already planned for Austin, Tex. and Atlanta. In Miami, Waymo will compete with Uber Technologies (UBER) and other rideshare services. In Austin and Atlanta, Waymo is partnering with Uber.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo also disclosed that it has reached 150,000 trips per week, rapid growth from August levels at 100,00 per week. Waymo is widely viewed as the leader in autonomous vehicles. In October, Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round, including Google and previous investors. If Wall Street analysts start including Waymo in Alphabet's valuation, it would be a big development.\n\nGoogle Stock: YouTube, TikTok\n\nAlso, analysts say GOOGL stock is getting a boost from the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory.\n\nAside from Google's core internet search advertising business, Wall Street analysts view growth at YouTube and cloud computing as key. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business, where it's battling Apple in smartphones.\n\nGoogle aims to slow down the growth of TikTok with its own short video platform. How much money Google generates from YouTube Shorts is a key issue for 2024, analysts say. YouTube Shorts now generates roughly 70 billion daily views.\n\nIn cloud computing, Google is still the third biggest service provider, behind Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft. Like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft' Azure business, Google's cloud unit has upped capital spending targeting the new opportunity in generative AI.\n\nGoogle's 2022 acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion seems to be paying dividends. Mandiant is part of Google's cloud-based cybersecurity services.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Is It A Buy Or Sell Now?\n\nGOOGL stock popped 37% in 2024, though it pulled back from a high of 201.42 set on Dec. 17.\n\nWhether the internet giant is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Rating of Alphabet stock currently stands at 76 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.\n\nGoogle stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.\n\nFurther, Alphabet stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

            "content": "The Data Center revenues came in at $35.58 billion compared with the consensus estimate of $33.51 billion, marking a jump of 93% year over year. Within this segment, Computing revenues were $$32.56 billion versus the consensus mark of $30.22 billion. Networking revenues were $3.02 billion versus the consensus estimate of $3.35 billion.\n\nDespite this stellar performance, a section of financial researchers is complaining about slowing growth. NVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin of 73.5% reflects a contraction of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis and 1.5% sequentially. This was primarily due to a transition to more complex and higher-cost systems within the Data Center segment.\n\nNVIDIA came up with quarterly adjusted earnings of $0.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.52 per share a year ago. Reported quarterly revenues of $39.33 billion compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.72 billion, representing a surprise of +4.3%.\n\nIrrespective of these drawbacks, NVIDIA has been able to keep the flag high with its path-breaking vision, innovation and solid execution. The recent decline in stock price has actually placed NVDA in negative territory year to date. We believe that, at this stage, NVIDIA offers a lucrative buying opportunity for the rest of 2025.\n\nYet, the stock price of NVDA plummeted 8.5% on Feb. 27 on concerns of a minor miss in adjusted gross margin and slowing growth of year-over-year revenues and earnings as we have seen in the last several quarters. Concerns about a possible tariff on NVIDIA\u2019s inputs and export restrictions also dampened investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nOn Feb. 26, after the closing bell, NVIDIA Corp. \u2014 the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) \u2014 released outstanding fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results and strong guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2026.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 3, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA Meta Platforms Inc. META, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Crop. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost importantly, NVDA has mostly resolved the supply-related issues of its next-generation Blackwell chips and ramped up its production and shipment. In the reported quarter, the company sold $11 billion Blackwell chips, higher than the consensus estimate of $6-7 billion.\n\nStrong Guidance\n\nNVIDIA expects an impressive first quarter fiscal 2026 buoyed by rock-solid demand for its AI-powered GPUs, and downplayed the Chinese DeepSeek-related availability of low-cost solution concerns. NVDA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said that the next-generation AI model requires more computing power. Per Huang, \u201cThe amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do.\u201d\n\nNVDA anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%), higher than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.06 billion. The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 71% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3.6 billion.\n\nThe consensus mark for non-GAAP gross margin is 72.1%. Nevertheless, an adjusted gross margin of more than 70% for a company that is the leader of a highly competitive high-end industry is something commendable.\n\nNVDA\u2019s Growth to Generate From Robust AI Spending\n\nThe AI frenzy will continue with astonishing spending. The four major data center operators \u2014 Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Crop. and Amazon.com Inc. pledged $325 billion as AI expenditure in 2025.\n\nOn Jan 21, President Donald Trump unveiled a joint venture called \u201cStargate\u201d with OpenAI, Oracleand Softbank. The project will create an AI infrastructure, especially data centers in the United States.\n\nThe initial investment of $100 billion can go up to $500 billion in the next four years. This expenditure will be in addition to Softbank\u2019s pledge of $100 billion in December to create AI infrastructure in the United States.\n\nApple has decided to invest $500 billion over the next four years, part of which will be spent on developing and manufacturing AI servers to power its Apple Intelligence AI tools. Moreover, Meta Platforms is reportedly planning to construct a new data center campus for its AI projects, with potential costs exceeding $200 billion.\n\nContinuous Innovations\n\nFor all the above-mentioned companies, NVIDIA is the largest chipset supplier. In addition to Blackwell, on June 2, 2024, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called Rubin. The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called Vera. Rubin is expected to be introduced in 2026.\n\nThe automotive industry may become another growth driver for NVIDIA in the future. In the last reported quarter, Automation segment revenues came in at $570 million compared with the consensus estimate of $472.35 million, up 102.9% year over year. The Automation segment\u2019s growth was primarily driven by NVDA\u2019s self-driving platforms. The company is increasingly focusing on powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.\n\nExcellent Estimate Revisions for NVDA Stock\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 45% and 41.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last seven days.\n\nIt has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.7% and 25.5%, respectively, for next year (ending January 2027). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.4% in the last seven days. NVDA has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 20%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 12.2% growth rate.\n\nLucrative Valuation of NVDA Shares\n\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has a return on equity (ROE) of 122.83% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s ROE of 17.1% and the industry\u2019s ROE of a mere 6.4%.\n\nNVDA has a current net margin of 55.85% compared with the industry\u2019s net margin of 8.4% and the S&P 500\u2019s net margin of 12.57%. It has forward P/E (price/earnings) of 31.14% compared with the industry\u2019s P/E of 31.01% and the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 18.9%.\n\nAs of Jan. 26, 2025, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $43.2 billion, up from $38.4 billion as of Oct. 27, 2024. The increases primarily reflect higher revenues partially offset by stock repurchases. As of Jan. 26, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, which remained unchanged sequentially. NVIDIA generated $16.6 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $11.5 billion\n\nThe short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 35% from the last closing price of $120.15. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $220-$135. This indicates a maximum upside of 83.3% and no downside.\n\nInvestment Thesis for NVDA\n\nShares of NVDA have seen a growth rate of -10.5% year to date. However, given that earnings estimate revisions are likely to trend higher in the coming weeks, many analysts are expected to raise their price targets. This will make NVDA\u2019s risk/reward ratio more favorable.\n\nNVIDIA represents a rare opportunity to invest in a company with proven execution and substantial unrealized potential in the AI revolution. At this stage, it will be prudent to buy this stock on every dip. Create a systematic investment plan for this stock to do a cost average.\n\nHold this stock for the long term as the company\u2019s strong execution of the last several quarters and robust future projections will generate more value. Consequently, the stock price of NVIDIA should witness an attractive upside.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~29.4%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~19.2x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\n\nAs per Morningstar, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a wide moat, thanks to the intangible assets, network effect, cost advantage, and customer switching costs. The firm anticipates Google Search to see growth at a mid-to-high-single-digit level over the upcoming 5 years as and when the broader digital advertising market matures and growth rates slow down. Notably, YouTube is expected to grow at a low-double-digit rate over the next 5 years as robust advertising business continues to be supported by increased subscription business, says Morningstar. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s core advertising business is significantly involved in the advertising budgets, allowing the company to benefit from a secular increase in digital advertising spending.\n\nThe cash flows generated by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s advertising business can be reinvested in growth areas including Google Cloud Platform, AI-infused search, and dynamic projects like Waymo. Apart from this, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-placed to capture significant opportunity in the ever-evolving public cloud space given its position as a critical cloud vendor for enterprises focused on digitizing their workloads.\n\nQualivian Investment Partners, an investment partnership focused on long-only public equities, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet\u2019s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Management continued to highlight developments with their generative AI program, which is seen as a foundational platform with opportunities across their businesses but particularly in search and cloud. However, this comes with material capex investment well ahead of the expected economic benefits from Gen AI, and the level of spending is leading investors to worry about the ROI on that spend for Alphabet, as well as the other hyperscalers (Microsoft and Amazon). We continue to have confidence in Alphabet\u2019s ability to generate strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth well above the S&P 500\u2019s in the years to come and view it as a core holding for the long term.\u201d\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Taara's general manager, Mahesh Krishnaswamy, has introduced the Taara chip, a silicon photonic chip that uses light to transmit high-speed data through the air. The Taara chip is abut the size of a fingernail, far smaller than the technology the Alphabet division has been using. Taara Lightbridge, which is what its first-generation technology is called, is the size of a traffic light and uses a system of mirrors and sensors to physically steer light to where it needs to go. The new chip uses software instead.\n\nTaara is a project under X, Alphabet's moonshot factory. The high speed wireless optical link technology underpinning the project was originally developed for X's Project Loon internet broadcasting balloons. Alphabet pulled the plug on Loon in 2021 and focused on Taara instead, using its technology to beam broadband across the Congo River and the streets of Nairobi. Even years before Loon shut down, Alphabet's X was already toying with the idea of using light to beam internet and tested the technology in India.\n\nTaara's technology works by using a \"very narrow, invisible light beam to transmit data at speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second, up to distances of 20 kilometers (12.1 miles).\" It's like traditional fiber, in the sense that it uses light to carry data, except that light doesn't travel through cables. Instead, Taara's hardware emits beams of light. The beams from two units must be aligned with each other to be able to form a secure link that can transmit data, which is why Lightbridge was fitted with the parts needed to be able to physically steer the light. Taara's new chip doesn't need those components: It contains hundreds of tiny light emitters controlled by software with automatic steering\n\nKrishnaswamy said Taara's light-beaming units will only take days to install instead of the months or years it can take to lay fiber. During tests in the lab, the Taara team was able to transmit data at speeds of 10 Gbps over a distance of one kilometer (0.62 miles) using two of the new chips. They're now looking to improve the chip's capacity and range by creating an \"iteration with thousands of [light] emitters.\" The team expects the chip to be available in 2026.",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other best money making stocks to buy now.\n\nThe US markets have been on a stellar run over the past couple of years, with two-year gains of 53%. This is the best performance for the broad market index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market has benefited from waning inflation, declining interest rates, and a resilient economy that has avoided recession. While continued growth is projected for 2025, analysts also warn of the rally having gone too far, with a correction in the offing this year. Moreover, the looming threat of fierce trade wars is already taking a toll on investor sentiment.\n\nThe broad market index fell for the fourth successive day on Tuesday, February 25, slipping 0.47% amid heightened concerns about economic growth and global trade. According to CNBC, investors are turning to US bonds, with treasury yield dropping below 4.3% to touch the lowest level since December.\n\nThe US president has announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will begin next month, ending the month-long suspension. The new administration also recently imposed additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and continues to warn the European Union of similar import taxes, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of Washington.\n\nProtectionist policies have sparked market concerns about which countries will be next on the American president\u2019s list, leaving several large multinationals unsure of how to plan. Past trends show that the broad market index dropped by 5% on days when the US, under Trump\u2019s first stint as president, announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. The index fell by a cumulative 7% when other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe recent consumer confidence survey for February has added to the negative mood, with results coming in weaker than economists\u2019 estimates and registering the largest deterioration since August 2021. This is the third straight monthly decline, pushing the index to 98.3%, its lowest since June 2024.\n\nStephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, stated the following about the dip:\n\nOf the five components of the Index, only consumers\u2019 assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through screeners to identify stocks with a market cap of over $2 billion (mid-cap or above), whose ROE was greater than 30%, and ROI of more than 25%, as of the close of business on February 25. From there, we selected the 7 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 prominent hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nMarket Cap: $2.15 trillion\n\nROE: 32.91%\n\nROI: 28.68%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 174\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. The company is also known for pioneering work and research in cloud computing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. It is on the fourth spot in our list of the best money making stocks to buy now.\n\nDuring the Q4 2024 earnings call on February 4, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a quarterly revenue of $96.47 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong momentum across the business. Total operating income increased 31% during the quarter while operating margin rose by five percentage points to 32%. Net income surged 28% from last year to $26.54 billion. EPS stood at $2.15, representing a 31% growth compared to Q4 2023 and beating estimates by two cents.\n\nRobust results in Q4 have raised investor confidence in the stock. The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u2013 GOOG was a top performer this quarter reflecting strong results from its ad business, Cloud growth, and margin enhancements. Investors got some clarity on the antitrust lawsuits during the quarter, but potential outcomes from these cases remain uncertain. Margins in the core business continue to improve, and growth in the Cloud business accelerated. Management has executed its expense control plans and expanded margins through better product and process organization. GOOG has a solid balance sheet, significant market share, and generates strong returns on invested capital.\n\nAnother driver of positive momentum for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been the recent launch of its latest quantum computing chip, called Willow, which is expected to be useful for large-scale simulation and code-breaking when quantum computing matures. The technology will help reduce errors exponentially as it scales up using more qubits. Industry experts describe this as a major breakthrough that has been pursued for nearly three decades.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average share price upside potential of over 22%. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database for Q4 2024, 174 hedge funds held a stake in the company.\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 4th on our list of best money making stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Quantum computing stocks are receiving outsized attention as it emerges as AI's newest breakthrough.\n\nFor the last couple of years, investors have learned how artificial intelligence (AI) is paving the way for a new frontier in the technology sector. At this point, it's common knowledge that AI is used for developing software, building large language models (LLMs), and even training autonomous vehicles.\n\nWhile these applications are exciting, a new pocket of the AI realm is starting to receive quite a bit of attention. Stocks including Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ have witnessed quite a bit of action over the last few months, as each of these companies claims to be leading the charge in AI's \"next big thing\" -- quantum computing.\n\nThe temptation to follow momentum into little-known opportunities is very real. After all, what if one of these companies becomes the next millionaire-maker AI stock?\n\nAlthough I understand this line of thinking, I'd encourage potential investors to take a step back and remember that Rigetti, D-Wave, and IonQ were all penny stocks less than a year ago. Instead of buying into a narrative, investors are better off focusing on existing leaders in the AI market and assessing which of those companies may parlay its accomplishments into quantum computing.\n\nLet's explore two companies that I think are poised to make a splash in the quantum computing arena, and assess why each looks like a great buy right now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nMy hunch is that you're already familiar with Alphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) since the company operates two of the most visited websites on the internet -- Google and YouTube.\n\nWhile Alphabet derives most of its sales through advertising, the company has made investments in AI-powered services to bolster its business model, which now supports workplace productivity tools akin to Microsoft's Office suite, cybersecurity solutions, cloud computing infrastructure, and hardware devices such as mobile phones.\n\nIn addition to its existing AI products, Alphabet has also been quietly exploring the area of quantum computing. Back in December, the company revealed that its quantum chip, dubbed Willow, demonstrated reduced error rates and astonishingly fast computational speeds during an experiment. Specifically, Willow's superior processing power solved a problem in five minutes that would otherwise have taken the most sophisticated supercomputers 10 septillion years to crack.\n\nIndeed, this is impressive work from Alphabet. But I think this case study underscores one thing above all else: Quantum computing doesn't have much application today, given where things currently stand in the AI revolution.\n\nNevertheless, I actually see that dynamic as a benefit for Alphabet. The company already has an established footprint in the AI market, and given Alphabet's hugely profitable business, the company has the financial flexibility to explore and build best-in-class products in emerging areas.\n\nSo even if Willow isn't a money-making machine for Alphabet today, the company's accomplishments have me optimistic that quantum computing will at some point become further integrated into Alphabet's existing AI suite, further separating the company from an intense competitive landscape.\n\n2. IBM\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM 0.27%) has developed a series of quantum computing processors known as Heron, Condor, Eagle, and Osprey. However, it's the company's software platform that has me most excited.\n\nIBM offers a quantum computing software application called Qiskit. Qiskit is a software suite marketed toward quantum developers. Some of the selling points of the platform are that it helps streamline workflows, assists with code generation, and provides cloud-based infrastructure to run workloads across various devices.\n\nFor me, IBM is flying under the radar in both the AI race and specific quantum computing use cases. While many quantum computing companies are still experimenting in theory-based advancements, IBM has a unique opportunity to build end-to-end quantum infrastructure through a combination of its hardware processors and the Qiskit software suite. This could be a major differentiator from other companies developing quantum computing products and one that could help IBM begin to really scale as the AI movement heats up.",

That's the goal of Google's secret R&D lab \"X\" which is working on a project codenamed Taara. The latter is a chip that was developed to deliver data at the speed of light. Google's Mahesh Krishnaswamy, General Manager, Taara, wrote in a blog post that the chip has been tested for the last seven years and has been able to deliver the internet at speeds as fast as fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chip would be able to bring internet access to areas where traditional connectivity is too expensive or too geographically challenging to offer it. Looking to reduce the complexity and cost of the Taara chip, Google today announced its next-gen Taara chip. Most of the core functionality of the Taara Lightbridge, the first generation of the system, moved light physically using a system of mirrors, sensors, and hardware; the next-gen chip uses software to steer, track, and correct the beam of light without requiring bulky moving parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith today's big news, the core functionality of Taara Lightbridge has been reduced from the size of a traffic light to the size of a fingernail. That's the kind of breakthrough that takes ideas over the finish line to become real-life technology used by many.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive the latest Google news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile mechanical components used to be needed for automatic beam steering, with the new Taara chip, an advanced tracking system \"steers, tracks, and corrects light with extraordinary precision.\" Each Taara chip has hundreds of light emitters and software is used to control the direction that the lights are sent to make sure they go where they need to go for the system to work correctly. When the two light beams lock into each other, they form a secure link for data transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile fiber uses light transmitted through underground cables to carry the internet, Taara uses an invisible narrow, light beam to transmit data at speeds as fast as 20 Gbps for a distance as far away as 12.43 miles. One of the reasons why Taara is so important is that it takes only a matter of hours to have the platform up and running compared to the days, months, or even years it takes to install fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle believes that using light to transmit data will save money and allow underserved areas of the world to connect to the internet. The technology could lead to the launch of autonomous vehicles using Taara to communicate faster. \"The possibilities are as boundless as light itself,\" Krishnaswamy writes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taara chip will launch in 2026, says Google. The company is asking innovators and researchers interested in \"exploring new applications for the technology\" to contact the team via email at \"taarateam@x.team. Who knows? You might just stumble on an amazing application that uses Taara to disseminate the internet to those who might otherwise might never have the chance to tap into its awesome powers.\n\n",

            "content": "As winter starts to wrap up and we head into March, one thing is clear: Artificial intelligence (AI) investing will still be a major theme in 2025. As a result, investors need to ensure their portfolios are properly positioned to take advantage of this massive investment trend.\n\nI have four stocks that look like top-notch buys in March. They can be divided into two categories: AI facilitators and AI hardware providers.\n\nAI facilitators: Alphabet and Meta Platforms\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) and Meta Platforms (META 2.29%) are two key companies facilitating the AI arms race. Both have generative AI models to offer potential users, with Alphabet's Gemini and Meta's Llama models. How these two models are set up and utilized is entirely different, but each has a strong user base.\n\nBy facilitating the AI arms race, each is locking in a potential user base, which will pay off over the long term. Because Meta's model is free to use, it does not benefit from a subscription cost. Instead, it's using all the data it gets from being a free-to-use platform to train future models. Gemini is available as a free offering, but a premium subscription unlocks further capabilities. However, Alphabet has also woven its Gemini model into its primary business: Google Search.\n\nAI has a huge effect on both companies, and each is heavily investing in its AI capabilities to ensure that the demand is met. Furthermore, each stock sold off substantially over the past week, as the broad tech market weakness hit both. This opens up a potential investment opportunity, as each is fairly priced, considering their growth levels.\n\nAt 26 times forward earnings (Meta) and 19.5 times forward earnings (Alphabet), each stock looks like a very strong buy, considering how much they benefit from the AI trend. I think each is a great buy in March, and investors should use this near-term weakness to their advantage.\n\nAI hardware: Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML\n\nNone of these AI innovations would be possible without chip manufacturers and suppliers' equipment, which is why Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.63%) and ASML (ASML 1.91%) made this list.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, making chips for many of the world's most advanced tech companies. It's seeing a massive boom on its AI chip side, with management expecting around a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years for its AI-related chips. That's a massive growth rate, and it shows the high demand for hardware to power all the AI innovations.\n\nHowever, Taiwan Semi has to buy machines to fulfill this capacity, which is where ASML comes in.\n\nASML is the only company in the world that makes extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which lay microscopic traces on a chip. The chip technology we enjoy today wouldn't be impossible without its machines. Furthermore, ASML's technological monopoly is protected by decades of research and billions of investment dollars, so it will be almost impossible to unseat it from its leadership position.\n\nBoth ASML and Taiwan Semi are key beneficiaries of the AI arms race but also benefit from the general proliferation of chip usage. Fortunately for investors, each stock is also priced at an attractive entry point.\n\nBoth of these prices for TSMC's and ASML's stock are reasonable, considering their market leadership positions in their respective industries. These stocks look like fantastic buys in March, and investors should use any weakness to load up on them. Thanks to the AI arms race, they should be long-term market winners.",

            "content": "Similar to how artificial intelligence (AI) investing has been one of the biggest market drivers over the past few years, quantum computing could be another massive investing wave. Considering that traditional computing has been around for a long time, and the first personal computer could have been purchased 50 years ago, quantum computing has the chance to be a generational investing trend if it takes the same amount of time to be implemented.\n\nMany companies are vying for the top spot in this lucrative field, ranging from smaller pure plays to the most established big tech companies. Two of the big tech companies that have captured the most quantum computing headlines are Alphabet (GOOG 1.82%) (GOOGL 1.87%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.74%). Both of these tech giants have announced innovative quantum computing breakthroughs over the past three months, but is either of them clearly ahead in this important race?\n\nBoth companies have made innovative discoveries\n\nFirst, let's discuss why quantum computing is a big deal. Traditional computing transmits information in bits, which come in the form of either a 0 or a 1. Quantum computing transmits information in qubits, which can better be described as the probability of information being a 0 or 1. Because qubits aren't exactly a 0 or a 1 but instead a superposition between a 0 or a 1, they can hold infinitely more information than a bit. On the flip side, there are inherent errors in the system because qubits don't have an exact 0 or 1 answer.\n\nThis is the biggest hurdle for quantum computing companies right now, as they need to be able to produce answers without errors. Imagine running a program on a quantum computer, and the answer is right 99% of the time. That's not acceptable, and to fix that, you'd likely run the program a few times to ensure that the answer you got is correct. However, the advantage that quantum computing would have over traditional computing is eroded if we run a task multiple times to ensure we get the correct answer.\n\nThis problem is being handled in different ways by different firms. Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet) used the chip's geometry to solve this problem. Its Willow quantum computing chip organizes qubits in a grid, making the chip more accurate as it scales up. The Willow chip had 105 qubits and produced less than 1% error for the test it was running.\n\nMicrosoft recently announced its Majorana 1 chip, and they invented a new state of matter to help solve this issue: a topological state. This allows them to control qubits digitally without the drawbacks of other quantum computing designs. The Majorana 1 chips currently have eight qubits on the chip but can scale up to 1 million qubits as the technology progresses.\n\nThese are two important breakthroughs, but we're still way too far away to understand if one of these innovations is the deciding factor in the quantum computing arms race. As a result, if you're buying either of these two stocks now, you're really buying them for their current businesses in addition to the wild card of quantum computing.\n\nAlphabet looks like a better buy based solely on current business results\n\nBoth of these big tech companies have dominant offerings in their respective fields and are huge players in the AI arms race. Additionally, each has a strong cloud computing wing that provides computing power to many clients.\n\nIt's hard to say if one company has a better business model than the other, so we'll compare their growth rates and valuations.\n\nOn the revenue side, Microsoft has a slight edge over Alphabet in recent and projected growth rates over their current fiscal years.\n\nMicrosoft has a slight edge here, but it's hardly one that can be quantified. However, there's a clear edge when it comes to the price you have to pay to either stock.\n\nMicrosoft's stock trades at a 50% premium to Alphabet's, which is rather significant. I'm not sure if the financial results support Microsoft's valuation as 50% higher than Alphabet's, so based on their current business, I'd say Alphabet is the better buy of the two.\n\nHowever, if you're judging this race based on quantum computing results, then it's too early to tell which company has the better offering. So, buying both companies is a good idea if you're only focused on quantum computing.",

            "content": "When MTV launched in 1981, the first video it aired was The Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star.\" At the time, it seemed as if the song's premise might come true. Over four decades later, though, radio remains strong, and MTV's heyday is long gone.\n\nThis music trivia comes to mind when considering the impact of generative AI on Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). After OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, some proclaimed generative AI presented an existential threat to Google. But could the technology help Alphabet instead of hurting it? The company thinks so.\n\nHere's how generative AI factors into Alphabet's plans for growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nJack Caporal, research director for The Motley Fool, analyzed all of Alphabet's references to AI in earnings calls from the end of December 2023 through September 2024. He concluded that Alphabet views \"generative AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity in which it has deep institutional expertise.\" The obvious way generative AI could help Alphabet grow is in its Google Cloud business.\n\nGoogle Cloud ranks as the third-largest cloud services provider, behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Google Cloud's revenue soared 30% to $11.9 billion. In Alphabet's Q4 earnings call, CFO Anat Ashkenazi attributed much of this growth to \"very strong demand for our AI products.\" She added, \"And we exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\"\n\nThose generative AI products include Vertex AI Studio, which helps customers rapidly prototype and test generative AI models. Vertex AI Builder supports the development of generative AI agents and applications. Generative AI Document Summarization extracts text from PDFs and summarizes the text. Gemini Code Assist helps create, modify, and troubleshoot software code.\n\nWhile Google Cloud (like AWS and Microsoft) uses Nvidia's GPUs, the unit also relies upon its own chips to handle generative AI models. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), including its Trillium chip, are custom-designed AI accelerators used in the training and inference of AI models. Its Axion chips are CPUs based on Arm's Neoverse V2 platform.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAs important as Google Cloud is to Alphabet, the company still makes most of its money from advertising on its Google Search and YouTube platforms. Generative AI is key to the growth of these products, too.\n\nThe introduction of AI Overviews (generative AI-generated summaries of search results) in Google Search has proven highly successful so far. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in the Q4 earnings call, \"People use Search more with AI Overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions.\"",

            "content": "Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot factory,\u201d known as X, has long cultivated craziness in its edgy projects. Perhaps the most outlandish was Loon, which aimed to deliver internet via hundreds of high-flying balloons. Loon eventually \u201cgraduated\u201d from X as a separate Alphabet division, before its parent company determined that the business model simply didn\u2019t work. By the time that balloon popped in 2021, one of the Loon engineers had already left the project to form a team specifically working on the data transmission part of connectivity\u2014namely, delivering high-bandwidth internet via laser beams. Think fiber optics without the cables.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new idea, but over the past few years, Taara, as the X project is called, has been quietly perfecting real-world implementations. Now, Alphabet is launching a new generation of its technology\u2014a chip\u2014that it says will not only make Taara a viable option to deliver high-speed internet, but potentially usher in a new era where light does much of the work that radio waves do today, only faster.\n\nTaara Chip 1. Courtesy of X, the Moonshot Company. Taara chip close-up. Courtesy of Kristen Sard/ X, the Moonshot Company\n\nThe former Loon engineer who leads Taara is Mahesh Krishnaswamy. Ever since he first went online as a student in his hometown of Chennai, India\u2014he had to go to the US embassy to get access to a computer\u2014he has been obsessed with connectivity. \u201cSince then, I made it my life's mission to find ways to bring people like me online,\u201d he tells me at X\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, California. He found his way to America and worked at Apple before joining Google in 2013. That\u2019s where he first got motivated to use light for internet connectivity\u2014not for transmissions to ground stations, but for high-speed data transfer between balloons. Krishnaswamy left Loon in 2016 to form a team to develop that technology, called Taara.\n\nThis is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.\n\nMy big question to Krishnaswamy was, who needs it? In the 2010s, companies like Google and Facebook made a big deal of trying to connect \u201cthe next billion users\u201d with wild projects like Loon and high-flying drones. (Facebook even worked on the idea that\u2019s at the core of Taara\u2014\u201cinvisible beams of light \u2026 that transmit data 10 times faster than current versions,\u201d as my former colleague Jessi Hempel wrote in 2016. Mark Zuckerberg quietly shut the project down in 2018.) But now, through a variety of approaches, more of the world can get connected. That\u2019s one reason X cited for ending Loon. Most conspicuously, Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink can provide internet anywhere in the world, and Amazon is planning a competitor named Kuiper.\n\nBut Krishnaswamy says the global connectivity problem is far from solved. \u201cToday there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,\u201d he says. In addition, many more people, including in the US, have internet speeds that can\u2019t even support streaming. As for Starlink, he says that in denser areas, a lot of people have to share the transmission, and each of them gets less bandwidth and slower speeds. \u201cWe can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,\u201d he claims, though he seems to be referring to Taara\u2019s future capabilities and not its current status.\n\nOver the past few years, Taara has made advances in implementing its technology in the real world. Instead of beaming from space, Taara\u2019s \u201clight bridges\u201d\u2014which are about the size of a traffic light\u2014are earthbound. As X\u2019s \u201ccaptain of moonshots\u201d Astro Teller puts it, \u201cAs long as these two boxes can see each other, you get 20 gigabits per second, the equivalent of a fiber-optic cable, without having to trench the fiber-optic cable.\u201d Light bridges have complicated gimbals, mirrors, and lenses to zero in on the right spot to establish and hold the connection. The team has figured out how to compensate for potential line-of-sight interruptions like bird flights, rain, and wind. (Fog is the biggest impediment.) Once the high-speed transmission is completed from light bridge to light bridge, providers still have to use traditional means to get the bits from the bridge to the phone or computer.\n\nSanam Mozaffari and Devin Brinkley in the Taara lab. Courtesy of Peter Prato/ X, the Moonshot Company Taara's unit in the field. Courtesy of X, the Moonshot Company\n\nTaara is now a commercial operation, working in more than a dozen countries. One of its successes came in crossing the Congo River. On one side was Brazzaville, which had a direct fiber connection. On the other, Kinshasa, where internet used to cost five times more. A Taara light bridge spanning the 5-kilometer waterway provided Kinshasha with nearly equally cheap internet. Taara was also used at the 2024 Coachella music festival, augmenting what would have been an overwhelmed cellular network. Google itself is using a light bridge to provide high-speed bandwidth to a building on its new Bayview campus where it would have been difficult to extend a fiber cable.\n\nMohamed-Slim Alouini, a professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology who has worked in optics for a decade, describes Taara as \u201ca Ferrari\u201d of fiber-free optical. \u201cIt\u2019s fast and reliable but quite expensive.\u201d He says he spent around $30,000 for the last light bridge setup he bought from Alphabet for testing.\n\nThat could change with Taara\u2019s second-generation offering. Taara\u2019s engineers have used innovative light-augmenting solutions to create a silicon photonic chip that not only will shrink the gadgetry in its light bridges to the size of a fingernail\u2014replacing the mechanical gimbals and costly mirrors with solid-state circuitry\u2014but will eventually allow a single laser transmitter to pair with multiple receptors. Teller says that Taara\u2019s technology could trigger the same kind of transformation that we saw when data storage moved from tape drives to disk drives to our current solid-state devices.\n\nTaara lightbridge alignment.\n\nIn the shorter term, Teller and Krishnaswamy hope to see Taara technology used to provide high-bandwidth internet when fiber is unavailable. One use case would be delivering elite connectivity to an island community just offshore. Or providing high-speed internet after a natural disaster. But they also have more ambitious dreams. Teller and Krishnaswamy believe that 6G might be the final iteration to use radio waves. We\u2019re hitting a wall on the electromagnetic spectrum, they say. Traditional radio frequency bands are congested and running out of available bandwidth, making it harder to meet our growing demand for fast, reliable connectivity. \u201cWe have an enormous worldwide industry that's about to go through a very complex change,\u201d says Teller. The answer, as he sees it, is light\u2014which he thinks might be the key element in 7G. (You think the hype for 5G was bad? Just wait.)\n\nProfessor Alouini agrees. \u201cThose of us who are working in the field fully believe that at some point we will need to rely on optics, because the spectrum is getting congested,\u201d he says. Teller envisions thousands of Taara chips in mesh networks, throwing beams of light, in everything from phones to data centers to autonomous vehicles. \u201cSo to the extent that you buy this, it\u2019s going to be a very big deal,\u201d he says.",

( GOOGL ) has evolved beyond its roots as a search engine provider into cloud computing, digital advertising, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. The company dominates the online search market, with over 94% market share, while also expanding its presence in cloud services through Google Cloud and Google Workspace.\n\nCompanies valued over $200 billion are generally considered \u201cmega-cap\u201d stocks and Alphabet fits this criterion perfectly, exceeding the mark. Alphabet is a holding company that operates through Google, encompassing core internet services, and Other Bets, which includes innovative ventures like Waymo, Verily, and X.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThe internet search leader has seen a 17.3% decline from its 52-week high of $207.05 , reached on Feb. 4. Over the past three months, its shares have risen 1.2% , outperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrials Average's ( $DOWI ) 1.9% decline during the same period.\n\nLonger term, shares of Alphabet have soared 23.4% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the Dow Jones\u2019 12.6% rise over the same time frame. However, GOOGL is down 9.5% on a YTD basis, lagging behind DOWI's 3.1% return.\n\nGOOGL had been in a bullish trend last year, trading mostly above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, but recently, it has dipped below both indicators,\n\nAlphabet shares tumbled 7.3% following its Q4 earnings release on Feb. 4 due to Google Cloud's revenue growth slowing to 30%, missing the analyst consensus. Investors were also wary of Alphabet\u2019s aggressive AI infrastructure spending, with capital expenditures rising to $75 billion. Additionally, Google's Network ad business revenue declined by 4% to $8 billion, raising concerns about advertising weakness. Despite total revenue growing 12% to $96.5 billion and adjusted EPS rising 31% to $2.15, the market reacted negatively to slower cloud growth and rising costs.\n\nIn addition, GOOGL has underperformed its rival, Meta Platforms, Inc. ( META ), with META experiencing a 14.9% YTD rise and a 38.1% surge over the past 52 weeks.\n\nHowever, analysts are bullish about GOOGL's prospects, given its outperformance compared to the Dow Jones over the past year. With a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating from 50 analysts, the mean price target of $218.75 indicates a 28.6% premium to current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

For those who don\u2019t know, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek wreaked havoc in the tech world last month with its cut-price AI reasoning model, the R1, claiming that it outperforms many Western competitors.\n\nOnly a month later, hundreds of Chinese companies have already integrated the AI model into their products and services. At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies also report deploying DeepSeek into their systems. Tech giants Lenovo, Baidu, and Tencent have integrated it too.\n\nGoldman Sachs anticipates that the country\u2019s economy will reflect the positive impact of AI adoption from next year.\n\n\u201cThe recent emergence of DeepSeek ... suggests faster AI development and adoption in China than we previously anticipated.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm\n\nThe impact of the emergence was so intense, that it triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month. While the initial release of the R2 model was scheduled for release sometime in May, the company is now planning to launch it as early as possible.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek demonstrates that China is at or near the cutting edge of AI development, which boosts the prestige of China\u2019s economy and tech ecosystem, making them more attractive for global investors\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek is expecting highly of its new model too. The company said that it hopes that its new model will be able to produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. While competitors are still dealing with the implications of the R1 model, only time will tell how the market is going to react to its successor.\n\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Mid to senior-level employees may receive severance packages of 14 weeks\u2019 salary plus one additional week for each year of service.\n\nSeparately, Google\u2019s cloud unit is facing layoffs primarily affecting operations support staff.

Alphabet has been generating profit from its cloud business while competing with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nThese reductions follow comments from CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who recently identified cost-cutting as a top priority while Google expands AI infrastructure spending in 2025.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks that are linked to data centers.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, highlighted the growing significance of data centers as a major theme in the technology sector during Tuesday\u2019s episode. He pointed out that although it might not always be immediately visible in the broader market indices, data centers have become a significant investment focus.\n\n\u201cThe data center has been the single biggest investment story for months on end, even if it\u2019s not always obvious from the averages\u2026 This sea-change, one that we are undergoing in real time, with the data center theme suddenly going from positive to negative, is buried within the broader indices, but it\u2019s like a living, breathing, seething animal, a snorting bull turned into a grizzly, scratching and clawing back the gains in your portfolio.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer on 10 Stocks With The Biggest Declines Last Week and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer offered a historical perspective, tracing the rise of NVIDIA, a graphics and gaming chip maker, as pivotal to the development of modern data centers. He explained that the company\u2019s invention of a semiconductor capable of enabling both accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence became foundational to a wide range of technologies.\n\n\u201cThis semiconductor becomes the backbone of electric vehicles, of robots, and most important, of the data centers themselves\u2026 Huge warehouses full of servers. No large tech company worth its salt can afford to do without these data centers.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cramer revealed that the situation took a dramatic turn when a Chinese company found a way to achieve similar results with fewer, less expensive chips, throwing the entire data center industry into turmoil.\n\nDescribing the company as \"the odd man out of the Magnificent Seven,\" Cramer emphasized the company's central role in the tech market, noting that its products are essential to the operations of numerous tech companies. Cramer pointed out that President Trump's administration may impose tighter export controls on Chinese technology, which could further complicate the company\u2019s market position.\n\nAmong the companies most at risk from these changes, Cramer singled out semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment players, with the GPU kingpin standing out as the most exposed. He concluded by suggesting that some people even argue that the company\u2019s performance could be decisive to the future fortunes of major momentum stocks in the tech sector.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google on Wednesday cut staffers in its cloud division, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe reductions affected fewer than 100 people working in sales operations and were intended to free resources invest in the business and artificial intelligence, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn\u2019t been publicly announced. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company continues to make adjustments to \u201cmeet our customers\u2019 needs and the significant opportunity ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs teams have been doing across the company, we\u2019re making changes to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe retrenchment comes in the wake of slower growth from Google\u2019s cloud business, as well as massive spending aimed at supporting the tech giant\u2019s ambitions in AI. Earlier this month, Alphabet missed analysts\u2019 revenue projections for cloud, and its guidance for 2025 capital expenditures also far exceeded expectations.\n\nGoogle\u2019s reductions in cloud headcount follow previous, smaller moves by the company to downsize. In late January, as first reported by 9to5Google, the company announced a \u201cvoluntary exit program\u201d for employees working in its Platforms and Devices unit \u2014 a group of staffers from its Pixel hardware and Android software division that were merged in 2024 into one team. Throughout 2024, Google made cuts that slowly rippled across the company as it went through a process of reorganization unit by unit.\n\nThe cloud layoffs come as the tech industry\u2019s culling of its corporate workforces has become all but standard in a new year. Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are among those that have said they will cut underperforming employees or seek to hire cheaper international labor. The companies are under pressure to invest in AI technologies without risking profits.\n\nGoogle Cloud, which is regarded as one of the company\u2019s best bets for growth as the search business matures, remains a key area of investment. During the company\u2019s earnings call in February, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said the company expects \u201csome head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud.\u201d",

While the company hasn\u2019t shared how many roles were cut, reports suggest fewer than 100 employees in the cloud team were affected. This move reflects Google\u2019s effort to streamline operations and cement its position in the rapidly growing AI market. GOOGL stock has gained over 25% in the last 12 months.\n\nWhy Google Is Making These Cuts\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud job cuts come amid slower growth in its cloud business. In its recent fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report, the Silicon Valley giant posted $11.96 billion in cloud revenue, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $12.19 billion. This slowdown has led the company to rethink spending and make changes across various teams to stay on track.\n\nAt the same time, Google is making a major push into AI, which is now a core part of its strategy. During its Q4 earnings call, the company announced plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenses this year to accelerate its AI projects.\n\nCFO Anat Ashkenazi also emphasized the need to control costs while increasing AI investments to maintain an edge in the competitive tech landscape. By restructuring, Google aims to keep pace with rivals like Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure, both of which are expanding their AI capabilities.\n\nEmployees Push Back on Layoffs\n\nThese cuts follow earlier, smaller layoffs as Google gradually reduced jobs across teams during its 2024 reorganization.\n\nHowever, not everyone is happy with these changes. More than 1,250 Google employees have reportedly signed a petition demanding better job security. Led by the Alphabet Workers Union, the petition urges Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to provide buyout packages before further layoffs and ensure fair severance for those affected.\n\nThis shows that workers are demanding fair treatment as the company undergoes major changes.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Alphabet has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 37 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 26 Buy and eleven Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average GOOGL price target of $215.56 implies 24.80% upside from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL stock analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nThe race to gain a competitive edge in the generative artificial intelligence industry fiercely continues, and Anthropic is the latest one making a move. On Monday, the artificial intelligence startup announced the launch of its advanced AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, stating that it is its \u201cmost intelligent\u201d version yet. This model can produce faster responses or display its step-by-step reasoning process, as reported by Reuters.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Surging on News and Analyst Calls\n\nAnthropic\u2019s hybrid model combines multiple reasoning approaches to solve complex problems more effectively. It was launched amid fierce competition in the world of AI. According to the company, the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model is its most advanced version and will be available on all Claude plans, including Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise. However, it noted that the \u201cextended thinking mode\u201d feature is only available on paid plans.\n\n\u201cThis model has all the capabilities wrapped together \u2014 we want one coherent AI that can help with everything. There\u2019s an advantage in simplicity for our customers.\u201d\n\nKaplan further stated that the \u201chybrid\u201d model, going live immediately, operates like a human brain. While some questions require quick responses, many others require critical thinking, which is why the company is looking to integrate both. Elaborating on the extended thinking mode, the company said that it is a model that \u201cself-reflects before answering,\u201d thereby improving its performance in math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks. Notably, the company said that this model has been specifically designed to focus on \u201creal-world\u201d tasks instead of math and computer science problems. This is so that it can reflect how businesses use large-language models.\n\nAccording to analysts, Anthropic\u2019s move can grant it an edge against OpenAI and other tech companies investing in AI technologies.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

Winner of Vogue Italia and Alta Roma\u2019s 2022 Who Is on Next? Franca Sozzani Award, the label work with upcycled and found materials to create imaginative worlds and one-of-kind-garments. The brand is now under the wing of the Sozzani Foundation, where it presented today and in 2023; last season Sunnei lent the label space to show. Going into year five, the brand is starting to get some traction in retail with stockists in Japan that, Scaburri noted on a call, \u201cunderstand our poetry\u201d and a recent installation at Dover Street Market Paris.\n\nThe brand name, Lessico Familiare, is adapted from Lessico Famigliare (Family Sayings), a 1963 novel by Natalia Ginzburg, and the label\u2019s work stays closes to home in the sense that it often makes use of (familiar) home textiles and furnishings. This season\u2019s work is titled Abecedario (the Alphabet), and the idea was that the letters would be the models. \u201cEvery single letter is going to have an object, a color, a movie, a character, a dress that belongs to our world,\u201d Scaburri said. Only a half dozen or so of the letters are garments; the rest are physical objects and photographs of flea markets finds. All of these, plus commissioned text, have been gathered together into a small book (see the pages below).\n\n\u201cI hope people will understand it. I don\u2019t want them to think that it\u2019s just a table full of objects; I want them to understand that the alphabet is the runway and the letters are going to be our cast,\u201d Scaburri said. \u201cIf a stylist asks us for Look No. 6 (which is F), they are going to receive an actual object. We were always thinking that one day we wanted to do something different from just garments,\u201d the designer continued, \u201cand since the brand started from a novel, we went back to the novel, we went back to the alphabet, to the sentences, the letters, the words, and that\u2019s why we wanted to create our own alphabet. And in this collection, there are not just our letters; we asked Jonathan Bazzi, a young Italian writer, to write small stories about five letters.\u201d\n\nFashion\u2019s relationship to literature has been depicted in many forms over the years. Stories such as Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland have inspired shoots. At Gucci, for fall 2017, Alessandro Michele issued an invitation in the form of an LP with readings from William Blake and Jane Austen and designed clutches that resembled Austen novels. Kim Jones had TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land read aloud at his fall 2023 Dior Men show, and Christian Dior himself is famous for giving letter names\u2014H and Y\u2014to his ever-changing silhouettes. This LF collection payed direct tribute to three female authors (Ginzburg, Jane Austen, and Virginia Woolf), but the team took the idea of language beyond reference point and into experience, connecting to a realm bigger than fashion. Scaburri put it this way: \u201cI love the idea of escapism in terms of inspiration. Maybe I need to create my own bubble, but in the end this bubble, it\u2019s in a world\u2014you have to deal with what is happening.\u201d This collection, he continued, is a \u201creflection on the importance of the words, how we use words. A good picture is no longer enough; I feel like there should be words, as well as the eye and smell, as well as the thought and the mind too.\u201d",

The company argues this keeps traffic on Google while diminishing the value of publishing content online.\n\nChegg warns in its lawsuit that this practice will result in a \u201chollowed-out information ecosystem of little use and unworthy of trust.\u201d While Chegg notes this has dropped its own traffic and use of services, it also warns this is a larger danger to online search and publishing.\n\nAlphabet argues against these claims, but it\u2019s already facing scrutiny over an alleged domination of the search ecosystem. Additional lawsuits against it further these arguments as U.S. judges weigh what to do with the search giant.\n\nChegg Considers Strategic Alternatives\n\nAlongside the lawsuit, Chegg warned investors that the company is pursuing strategic alternatives. That\u2019s a red flag in the financial sector as it signals the company is running out of options to maintain operations.\n\nChegg\u2019s warning includes several options the company will consider in its strategic review. Among them are a potential acquisition of its business, going private, or continuing its current public listing.\n\nInvestor confidence was hammered after this announcement, sending shares of CHGG stock down 30.77% as of this writing. That\u2019s in addition to a 32.92% drop year-to-date. It also comes with heavy trading as 10.8 million shares change hands, compared to a three-month daily average of 2.49 million units.\n\nIs CHGG Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, the analysts\u2019 consensus rating for Chegg is Moderate Sell based on three Hold and three Sell ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $1.67, a high of $3, and a low of $1. This represents a potential 54.63% upside for CHGG stock.\n\nSee more CHGG stock analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned -10.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.90 points to a change of +10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.23 indicates a change of +15% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $75.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.9%. The $329.96 billion and $366.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.8% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $81.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.15 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +1.42%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025. Handpicked by Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian, this portfolio has been stunningly and consistently successful.

            "content": "The U.S. wants the European Union (EU) to urgently clarify its position on rules limiting the actions of American technology stocks, as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) faces a big fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s laws. According to Reuters, U.S. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan wrote to EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera requesting details of how the bloc enforces regulations that appear to target American tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms. (META).\n\n\u201cOverseas Extortion\u201d\n\nIt comes days after President Donald Trump said his administration would scrutinize the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA), which set strict rules on how technology firm operate. Trump signed a memorandum on Friday to \u201cdefend American companies and technology from overseas extortion.\u201d\n\nFollowing this move, in a letter seen by Reuters, Jordan suggested that the DMA \u201cmay target American companies\u201d and was stifling innovation. The Judiciary Chair also criticized the EU for imposing hefty fines on companies that breach rules, which he said amounted to a \u201cEuropean tax on American companies.\u201d\n\nThe letter comes after it was reported the EU is about to charge Alphabet with breaching rules designed to stop its search results favoring its own services.\n\nU.S. and Europe Diverge\n\nWhile the EU has been investigating Alphabet since March, it comes amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over tariffs, trade, the Ukraine war and regulations over areas such as the climate and artificial intelligence.\n\nLast week for instance executives from Meta and Google criticized the EU over its perceived failure to foster innovation in AI, adding further weight to hard-hitting comments from Vice President JD Vance at the Paris AI summit.\n\nMETA has also been subject to investigations after it was accused of violating the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) with its \u201cpay-or-consent\u201d advertising model, prompting moves by the company to fall in line. However, the social media platform\u2019s revised no-ads subscription service may still be in breach of EU consumer and privacy laws, in addition to antitrust rules, according to the European Consumer Organisation, a consumer watchdog.\n\nFailure to comply with the DMA entails fines up to 10% of global annual revenue, which was about $350 billion for Alphabet last year, suggesting it could be fined as much as $35 billion. META boss Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that American tech companies operating in Europe had paid more than $30 billion in fines over the last two decades, suggesting a full fine of 10% of Alphabet\u2019s revenues would mark a major escalation by the EU authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s also been noted that the EU\u2019s mooted response to U.S. tariffs could include use of a further piece of legislation to target big tech stocks. The EU could lead on the \u201canti-coercion instrument\u201d (ACI), a powerful tool that was devised in 2023 as a deterrent to China but now could now form a key part of Europe\u2019s defense against U.S. trade measures. The ACI provides the EU a wide range of possible countermeasures against economic \u201ccoercion,\u201d including the imposition of tariffs and restrictions on trade in services.\n\nThe letter from House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan to Ribera, the top EU antitrust official, requests she brief the committee by March 10th.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Good Buy?\n\nOn Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 27 Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months. After a 25% rally in the past 12 months, the average GOOGL price target of $215.85 per share implies nearly 20% upside from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500, and if you\u2019re looking for a solid investment with growth potential, this tech giant should be on your radar.\n\nWith strong performance across its core businesses and a valuation that\u2019s cheaper than the broader market, now might be the perfect time to load up on shares.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Growth Engine Is Still Roaring\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: Alphabet isn\u2019t slowing down. In Q4, Google Search alone raked in over $48 billion in revenue, up 12.5% year over year. That\u2019s impressive for a business already dominating its space. But the real growth driver? Google Cloud.\n\nThanks to the booming demand for AI, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue soared 30% to hit $12 billion. As companies race to develop AI without the massive costs of in-house infrastructure, Google Cloud offers a scalable, cost-effective solution. And Alphabet is cashing in on that demand.\n\nCompany-wide, Alphabet\u2019s revenue jumped 13% year over year, while its operating margin improved from 27% to 32%. Even better, Alphabet repurchased $15.6 billion in shares last quarter, helping its earnings per share (EPS) climb an impressive 31%.\n\nWhy Alphabet Is Undervalued Compared to the S&P 500\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Alphabet\u2019s stock trades at 23 times trailing earnings and 20.6 times forward earnings estimates. Compare that to the S&P 500\u2019s 25.7 times trailing earnings and 22.5 times forward estimates, and it\u2019s clear that Alphabet is trading at a discount.\n\nThink about it: You\u2019re getting a company with double-digit revenue and earnings growth for a lower price than the broader market. That\u2019s a rare deal, especially when you consider Alphabet\u2019s dominant position in both digital advertising and cloud computing.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Alphabet?\n\nWall Street is optimistic about Alphabet\u2019s future. Analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue to grow by 11% annually in both 2025 and 2026. EPS is projected to rise by 12% next year and 14% the year after. Given that the stock market\u2019s long-term average growth rate is about 10%, Alphabet is poised to outperform.\n\nPlus, with its continued investment in AI and cloud computing, Alphabet is well-positioned to capitalize on some of the biggest trends in tech. Whether it\u2019s powering AI applications through Google Cloud or driving digital advertising revenue through Google Search and YouTube, Alphabet\u2019s growth story is far from over.\n\nBottom Line: Alphabet Is a Buy Right Now\n\nWhen a high-quality company like Alphabet trades at a discount to the broader market, it\u2019s an opportunity investors shouldn\u2019t ignore. With strong growth across its core businesses, improving profitability, and a valuation that\u2019s cheaper than the S&P 500, Alphabet is primed to deliver market-beating returns in the years ahead.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to add a reliable growth stock to your portfolio, now\u2019s the time to consider Alphabet.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

            "content": "\u201cMore flexibility, in an affordable way\u201d: that\u2019s what Alphabet\u2019s CEO wants to offer his customers. Who is Jesper Lyndberg, and how will he achieve that ambition? We found out, in a first interview with Fleet Europe.\n\nIn his previous role, Lyndberg was CEO of BMW Financial Services Denmark. Since November, he is the CEO of leasing company Alphabet International.\n\nHow have your first few months been at Alphabet\u2019s Munich HQ?\n\n\u201cAlphabet International really lives up to its name. It\u2019s a truly international environment,\u201d Lyndberg says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even need German in these first couple of months. However, taking over as leader here also means taking in the culture, so I\u2019m taking German language classes now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people here have been extremely welcoming. Working in the same business and across the same business lines has made it easy to step in and take over. One key difference: I used to focus on executing strategy and being very operational. Here, we develop a longer-term vision, look at trends to build a strategy for years to come, and craft an Alphabet customer experience to deliver to our international corporate customers and ultimately to our markets.\u201d\n\nAnd what is that Alphabet customer experience?\n\n\u201cA personal touch, supported by a strong digital standard. Yes, we believe people are central to our business, but where people don\u2019t create extra value, digitalization can. Let me explain. We have experienced employees who have built strong, long-lasting customer relationships. This remains key to our customer experience. However, when it comes to the practical, operational level, automation and digital support can help create value for our customers by making their work easier, faster, and more secure.\u201d\n\nHow will you create that value for your customers?\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of focus areas, like electrification and digitalization. Those are on everyone\u2019s agenda, but the difference is in how we execute these. Alphabet is probably the lessor which has taken the most concrete steps in these areas, with our Carbon Manager and our AI tool (launched at the Fleet Europe Days last October, Ed.). Our third pillar is our consultancy offer, which will soon be available in all our markets. In these three areas, our approach is the same: we focus on execution, we move the goalposts, and we measure our success by implementation, not by great ideas or great PowerPoints.\u201d\n\nWhat are your ambitions in terms of growing your customer base?\n\n\u201cOnce we have the tools in place, it will be easier to grow market share. Currently, we\u2019re the fourth-biggest leasing company in Europe. There is room for us to grow organically. Recent consolidations in our industry, like the merger of ALD and LeasePlan into Ayvens, provide us with opportunities to connect with fleet customers who may be interested in exploring a range of new service options.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is on Europe. Additionally, we need strong partners across the globe to support the activities of our customers outside of Europe. For this, we have OneNet, our network with 16 partners covering 26 markets. Of course, it\u2019s not the number of partners that\u2019s important, but the level of service our customers can expect. It needs to make sense to our customers, and to us.\u201d\n\nHow would you describe Alphabet\u2019s longer-term ambition?\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way to offer flexibility in an affordable way. When our customers commit to us for 48 months, that\u2019s a long period. In these challenging times, it\u2019s good to offer them more flexible solutions. This is where I want us to create success.\u201d\n\nHow, specifically?\n\n\u201cBy making BEVs more affordable. We can do this by not just looking at it from a contract perspective, but also by thinking about what we do with the asset after the contract. Who are our customers for that phase? That\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at not just at Alphabet, but with the whole BMW Group.\u201d\n\nIn your opinion, what is a leasing company\u2019s biggest hurdle when it comes to customers?\n\n\u201cBringing transparency to costs, and handling emissions. Everyone should go into this with open eyes. We can do this with our Carbon Manager and Consultancy services. With strict CSRD regulation coming, fleet managers need to know that they can\u2019t just scale down their fleets and have their employees acquire the cars for themselves. Three to four years from now, those emissions will also need to be part of a company\u2019s sustainability reporting. Fleets should carefully consider which cars to select and how to use them, and what impact they will have on their P&L and their reporting duties.\u201d\n\nFinal question: What\u2019s your advice for 2025 for the fleet managers community?\n\n\u201cStay the course! Stay true to your strategy, and stick to it even when your targets are under pressure. Companies that invest in the future and stick to their ambition will attract the right talent for future success. Leasing companies are sometimes the hammer with which fleets nail in their targets, but that also means we\u2019re the ones helping companies attract the right talent for the job.\u201d\n\nPhoto Source: Alphabet",

As part of the agreement, Salesforce commits to investing at least $2.5 billion in Google Cloud over the next seven years, allowing its clients to run software on Google's platform. This partnership is designed to attract enterprise customers, particularly those currently using Microsoft's products.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Salesforce's stock saw a recovery, initially dropping over 2% then rising more than 0.4%. Alphabet's stock also improved, gaining over 0.7% after a near-flat start.\n\nThe collaboration extends beyond cloud services, focusing on developing AI-enhanced tools for businesses. For example, Salesforce customers can utilize Google Workspace for drafting proposals and use Google's Gemini AI model for refining them. This move signifies Salesforce's shift towards developing AI agents to automate tasks like customer support and sales development, supported by Google Cloud's capabilities.\n\nDespite Microsoft's lead in enterprise AI, this partnership provides Google and Salesforce an opportunity to challenge Microsoft's dominance. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has criticized Microsoft's AI efforts, claiming Salesforce's AI agents offer superior performance.\n\nInvestors are keenly watching Salesforce's upcoming earnings report for signs of sales growth driven by new AI tools, with expectations of numerous Agentforce deals being signed this fiscal quarter.",

            "content": "The headline of this article says it all: Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) stock is cheaper than the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) index. It might seem a bit odd that a dominant tech company would fall behind the valuation of a broad market index, but that is exactly what happened.\n\nThis provides investors a rare opportunity to scoop up a best-in-class business for cheap and quells fears of potentially buying a significantly overvalued stock. I think it's time to load up on shares (if you haven't already), as Alphabet's stock is primed to deliver market-beating returns.\n\nAlphabet has multiple strong business units\n\nAlphabet's primary business is one of the most dominant in the world: Google. Many people surf the internet using the Google search engine, and Alphabet has built an incredible advertising business on top of that. In Q4, Google search generated more than $48 billion in revenue. Although its growth wasn't super-fast by any means, it still rose 12.5% year over year, a strong pace for a mature business unit.\n\nAlphabet gets its growth from other divisions, namely Google Cloud, its cloud computing segment that has seen strong growth thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. Cloud computing is primed to benefit from the general build-out of AI because it provides computing muscle to its users that would otherwise be too expensive to buy.\n\nMost companies can't justify spending tens of millions of dollars on a powerful computing server dedicated to AI development. Instead, they can rent that computing power from a cloud computing provider like Google Cloud and use it whenever they need to. This allows them to scale usage up or down easily.\n\nThis is a profitable business for Alphabet because Google Cloud can charge a premium for using the computing power bandwidth versus buying the equipment outright. In Q4, Google Cloud's revenue rose 30% to $12 billion, which is still about a quarter of the size of the Google search engine. Still, this is solid progress, and it's an area that will continue to grow as the AI arms race continues.\n\nWith Alphabet's revenue growing companywide 13% year over year, it's clear that it has the ability to beat the market based on growth alone. However, it also improved its operating margin (rising five percentage points from 27% to 32% year over year) and repurchased $15.6 billion shares in the quarter, which caused its earnings per share (EPS) to rise by an impressive 31% year over year.\n\nThat doesn't sound like a stock that should be valued at a discount to the market; it should have a premium. However, that's not the case. But if you can find these deals in the market, buying them is a smart idea, as the market will eventually correct itself.\n\nAlphabet's stock is priced to buy now\n\nRight now, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times trailing earnings and 20.6 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nFor comparison, the S&P 500 trades for 25.7 times trailing earnings and 22.5 times forward earnings estimates, so Alphabet's stock is discounted to the market in both of these important metrics.\n\nAlphabet's optimism-producing growth is expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 11% revenue growth in 2025 and 2026, alongside EPS growth of 12% and 14%, respectively. Considering the stock market's long-term average growth rate is 10% annually -- some years it's more; some years it's less, even a big loss -- and that stock returns are highly correlated to EPS growth over the long term, Alphabet looks like a stock that can grow faster than the market for some time.\n\nAs a result, it makes for a great purchase today for investors of all types, as it can be considered both a value play (cheaper than the market), as well as a growth story (Google Cloud and AI).",

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the world's fifth-largest company, with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion. It's experiencing strong growth thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming its legacy businesses, such as Google Search and Google Cloud.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's how Alphabet can chart a path to the ultra-exclusive $3 trillion club.\n\nAn image of Google's office headquarters.\n\nImage source: Alphabet.\n\nGoogle Search is transforming for the AI era\n\nAI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT offer a new way to access information online. Since they can provide direct answers to almost any question, they provide a more convenient user experience than traditional search engines, like Google, which require users to sift through web pages to find the information they need.\n\nAlphabet developed the Gemini family of large language models (LLMs) to compete with OpenAI's latest models, and it released a chatbot with the same name. However, Gemini is also powering new features within Google Search to protect its dominant market share during the AI era.\n\nOne of those features is AI Overviews, which uses a combination of text, images, and links to third-party websites to produce complete responses to user queries. They appear at the top of the traditional search results, so users no longer have to click through to different web pages. Alphabet says Overviews are live in more than 100 countries and are driving people to use Google Search more frequently because they can ask different questions and extract more information than before.\n\nPlus, Alphabet says Overviews monetize just as well as traditional sponsored ads in Google Search results, so they shouldn't cannibalize its advertising business. Last year, Alphabet noticed that the links placed within Overviews received more clicks than the same links placed among traditional search results, which might create an opportunity to make even more money in the future.\n\nMonetization is extremely important because Google Search generated $54 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended Dec. 31), representing more than half of Alphabet's total revenue of $96.4 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud is Alphabet's growth engine thanks to AI\n\nAlthough the search business accounts for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue, Google Cloud is the conglomerate's fastest-growing segment. It generated $11.9 billion in revenue during Q4, up 30% from the year-ago period (compared to just 12% growth in search revenue).\n\nGoogle Cloud operates data centers worldwide and provides many different services to help its business customers transition into the digital age. However, it's also becoming a popular destination for businesses needing data center computing capacity and ready-made LLMs (like Gemini) to build their own AI software.\n\nAlphabet says customers are currently using eight times the amount of computing capacity for AI training and inferencing than they were just 18 months ago. Plus, the number of developers using Gemini models to create their own AI software through Google Cloud doubled over the last six months to 4.4 million.\n\nMoreover, Google Cloud's AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a fivefold increase in customers during 2024 and a whopping 20-fold increase in usage. It now hosts more than 200 LLMs (including Gemini) for customers to choose from, giving them an incredible amount of variety to suit almost every use case.\n\nAlphabet allocated a record $52 billion to capital expenditures (capex) during 2024, most of which went toward building AI data center infrastructure and buying chips from suppliers like Nvidia. The company plans to increase its capex spending to $75 billion during 2025, which is the main reason its stock price sank by 7% the day after these results were released.\n\nCapex spending eats into profits, so investors are concerned about a potential dip in Alphabet's future earnings. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says for every $1 cloud providers spend on AI hardware, they could earn $5 over four years. Therefore, the long-term payoff could be enormous for Alphabet and its shareholders.\n\nAlphabet's (mathematical) path to the $3 trillion club\n\nAlphabet generated $8.04 in earnings per share (EPS) during 2024, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7. That makes it significantly cheaper than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, which trade at an average P/E ratio of 39.7:\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nIf Alphabet's P/E ratio simply rises to meet the average of the other three $3 trillion companies (39.7), it would translate to a 67% increase in its stock price and its market capitalization. In other words, Alphabet would become a $3.8 trillion company.\n\nAlphabet could also join the $3 trillion club if its P/E ratio remains the same (23.7) but grows its EPS by 30%. Wall Street's consensus forecast (provided by Yahoo!) suggests Alphabet's EPS could reach $10.22 in 2026, translating to 27% growth over the next two years. That means the company's valuation could cross $3 trillion sometime in 2027, with only a tiny amount of EPS growth required that year.\n\nI think a mixture of a higher P/E ratio and higher EPS will catapult Alphabet into the $3 trillion club sometime in the next 12 to 18 months. The company's P/E is currently so low because it lost a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice last year in which it was found guilty of monopolistic practices. The official punishment is expected to be handed down later this year.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought in 2020, at the tail end of President Donald Trump's first term, but he has returned to office with a very aggressive plan to slash regulation for businesses. When President Joe Biden was in the White House, the DOJ asked the judge to consider breaking Alphabet apart, which would hurt the company's earnings potential. However, on the campaign trail last year, Trump suggested he wasn't in favor of that outcome.\n\nIf the punishment amounts to a simple financial penalty instead (which sounds like the more probable outcome under Trump's DOJ), I think Alphabet's P/E ratio could soar from here and create a much easier path to the $3 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is within striking distance of all-time highs set in December. Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked growth and enthusiasm across the technology sector, fueling a rally that began in early 2023. Understandably, it has become increasingly challenging to find high-quality technology stocks trading at attractive prices.\n\nBut as I like to say, Wall Street is a market of stocks, not a stock market. In other words, there is always value somewhere.\n\nHigh-growth industries within technology, like AI, cloud computing, semiconductors, and cybersecurity, provide excellent hunting grounds for investors seeking the most bang for their buck. Here are three top technology stocks you can buy right now:\n\n1. Alphabet (Google)\n\nSearch engine giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is one of the few top tech stocks not trading near all-time highs. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has slipped since its fourth-quarter earnings release after the company disclosed plans to invest more money into AI data centers than analysts anticipated. Alphabet has traditionally generated gobs of cash profits through its advertising via Google and YouTube. These massive AI investments are new, impact cash flow, and don't have an immediate payoff.\n\nHowever, as management said on the Q4 2024 earnings call, the investments support cloud demand that currently outstrips Alphabet's available capacity. Additionally, these investments don't compromise Alphabet's robust financials. The company generated over $72 billion in free cash flow (net of capital investments) in 2024 and still has a whopping $95 billion in cash to under $11 billion in debt.\n\nAlphabet's golden goose, its ad business, grew over 10% in 2024. In other words, the core business is strong and can afford these investments aimed at long-term growth. Analysts estimate Alphabet will grow earnings by an average of over 16% annually over the long term. Yet, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio is just 23. The resulting PEG ratio (1.4) is among the best values in the Magnificent Seven today.\n\n2. SentinelOne\n\nNext-generation cybersecurity company SentinelOne (NYSE: S) appears to be underappreciated by Wall Street. Its price-to-sales ratio (10) is notably lower than that of peers like CrowdStrike (30), Palo Alto Networks (17), and Zscaler (14). That's despite SentinelOne's revenue growth continually keeping pace with its competition. SentinelOne's lack of profits could explain the disparity, which is a fair knock on the stock. Yet, it could be overblown because the company is rapidly improving its operating margin and has plenty of cash to balance profitability and investing to grow the business.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Alphabet\u2019s stock is undervalued, trading below the S&P 500, offering a rare investment opportunity in a dominant company.\n\nGoogle\u2019s advertising business generated over $48 billion last quarter, maintaining a 12.5% annual growth rate.\n\nGoogle Cloud is key to Alphabet\u2019s growth, with a 30% revenue increase to $12 billion and a significant role in the cloud and AI sectors.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s overall revenue rose by 13%, and its operating margin improved to 32%, indicating significant financial strength.\n\nA $15.6 billion share buyback enhanced earnings per share by 31%.\n\nAnticipated revenue and EPS growth of 11% and 12-14% suggest Alphabet\u2019s potential to outperform the market.\n\nBeneath the bustling waves of the stock market, a surprising gem has emerged. Alphabet, the titan behind Google, finds itself priced below the S&P 500, a rare anomaly for such a dominant force. This undervaluation cracks open a door for investors to snatch a piece of a premium company at a discount.\n\nWithin Alphabet\u2019s empire, Google reigns supreme. Its search engine doesn\u2019t just guide internet users\u2014it propels a colossal ad business, generating over $48 billion last quarter from Google\u2019s ever-reaching tentacles. Despite a mature brand, it still chalks up a robust 12.5% yearly gain. Yet, the real surge comes from the cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud, a powerhouse in cloud computing, fuels the AI revolution with its high-octane servers, allowing businesses to rent rather than own. This trend suits companies that crave flexibility without the hefty price tags associated with powerful AI hardware. Enjoying a 30% revenue uptick to $12 billion, it signifies a sector ready for explosive growth.\n\nAcross the board, Alphabet\u2019s figures are nothing short of impressive. With a 13% rise in overall revenue and an operating margin leaping from 27% to 32%, the numbers narrate a story of burgeoning strength. The company\u2019s shocking $15.6 billion share buyback further lifts its earnings per share by 31%.\n\nYet, against the odds, Alphabet\u2019s stock trades below the S&P 500 at just 23 times trailing earnings. Expected revenue and EPS growth, projected at around 11% and 12-14% in the coming years, only solidify its market-beating potential.\n\nFor investors, Alphabet presents itself not merely as a value opportunity but a growth narrative\u2014a chance to ride a wave of tech innovation at a discounted fare.\n\nWhy Alphabet\u2019s Low Valuation Amidst Robust Growth is a Golden Investment Opportunity\n\nFeatures, Specs & Pricing: Understanding Alphabet\u2019s Diverse Portfolio\n\nAlphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, encompasses a wide range of businesses. The core services include the Google Search engine, YouTube, Android, and Google Cloud. Each plays a pivotal role in Alphabet\u2019s revenue stream:\n\n\u2013 Google Search and Advertising: Continues to be the largest contributor to Alphabet\u2019s revenue, with cutting-edge AI models enhancing ad targeting and efficiency.\n\n\u2013 YouTube: Dominates video streaming and has expanded into podcasting and live content, driving up its ad revenue.\n\n\u2013 Google Cloud: Competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, with a focus on AI and machine learning as major growth areas.\n\nThe stock\u2019s current undervaluation at 23 times trailing earnings presents a unique investment opportunity against the S&P 500\u2019s average P/E ratio, particularly for a company with such significant growth potential.\n\nReal-World Use Cases: Alphabet\u2019s Impact and Applications\n\n1. AI and Machine Learning: Google Cloud offers platforms like TensorFlow that enable businesses to harness AI for predictive analytics, enhancing both operational efficiencies and customer experiences.\n\n2. Digital Advertising: Small businesses can leverage Google\u2019s ad services to reach vast audiences cost-effectively, thanks to targeted advertising algorithms.\n\n3. Education and Remote Work: Google\u2019s tools, like Google Workspace, enable seamless collaboration, making it a staple in both education and business environments.\n\nMarket Forecasts & Industry Trends\n\nThe cloud computing market, where Google Cloud is a major player, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 17% from 2021 to 2025 (Source: Gartner). This positions Alphabet to continue benefiting from shifts towards digital transformation.\n\nComparisons & Controversies: Alphabet Versus Competitors\n\nAlphabet\u2019s standing against competitors like Amazon and Microsoft highlights both its strengths and vulnerabilities:\n\n\u2013 Strengths: A robust ad-based business model, leading AI technology, and YouTube\u2019s dominance.\n\n\u2013 Weaknesses: Concerns over data privacy and heavy regulation could impact operations, highlighted in recent antitrust cases.\n\nPros & Cons Overview\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Diverse revenue streams reducing dependency on any single business unit.\n\n\u2013 Strong growth in sectors like cloud computing and AI.\n\n\u2013 Significant share buybacks that enhance shareholder value.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Subject to regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\u2013 Fierce competition from tech giants in cloud services.\n\n\u2013 Market sensitivity to any slowing in ad revenue growth.\n\nActionable Recommendations for Investors\n\n\u2013 Diversified Investment: Consider Alphabet as part of a broader technology and growth-focused portfolio.\n\n\u2013 Leverage Market Valuation: Take advantage of the current undervaluation for potential long-term gains.\n\n\u2013 Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about regulatory impacts on large tech companies, which could affect stock performance.\n\nInsights & Predictions\n\nGiven the steady growth in digital advertising and cloud computing, Alphabet\u2019s innovative developments in AI put it in a position to capitalize on the next wave of tech. The undervaluation presents a rare opportunity for investors to acquire high-growth stocks at a discounted rate.\n\nQuick Tips\n\n1. Research Analyst Opinions: Keep an eye on expert analyses and forecasts regularly to stay updated on stock performance.\n\n2. Monitor Quarterly Earnings: Quarterly reports can provide insight into how well Alphabet navigates market challenges.\n\n3.

            "content": "Both Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) fell following their Q4 results over the past few weeks. It wasn't for the strength each displayed in Q4; rather, it was because each company plans to spend a significant amount of money on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in 2025.\n\nSome investors would rather see that money returned to shareholders as dividends or stock buybacks, not reinvested in the business. While Alphabet spent a lot of money on share buybacks and dividends in 2024, it could have spent far more if it wasn't significantly spending on its AI capabilities. Amazon didn't spend a penny on share repurchases or dividends, so it clearly could have done more.\n\nHowever, that's shortsighted thinking, and long-term investors should be cheering the spending on as it secures the future of the business rather than only focusing on short-term outcomes. Alphabet and Amazon have been thinking this way for a long time, so it should be no surprise to investors that they are acting this way.\n\nI think there's one old adage that investors need to remember about Alphabet and Amazon. It will help them understand where these two are coming from.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet will have a massive increase in capital expenditures in 2025\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are planning to spend some serious dough on AI infrastructure this year. Alphabet plans on $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, while Amazon plans on around $100 billion. Compared to what these companies have spent over the past 12 months and what historical levels have been, this is an unprecedented amount of money being spent on capital expenditures.\n\nBoth companies have stated that the vast majority of this will be spent on cloud infrastructure, which is crucial to AI proliferation.\n\nAs the adage goes, you have to spend money to make money, and that couldn't be more true when assessing what Amazon and Alphabet are going to do in 2025. Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy makes it pretty clear as to why they are spending so much:\n\nIt's the way that AWS business works and the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more capex we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so, when AWS is expanding its capex, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign, medium to long term, for the AWS business.\n\nI couldn't have said it better myself (which is why I quoted it). In order to meet the coming demand, both Amazon and Alphabet have to get in front of it. Otherwise, potential customers will go to a different provider. This also signals strong growth over the long term, which is huge for both companies because these cloud computing businesses are absolute cash cows.\n\nCloud computing is a significant part of each company's financial picture\n\nMany companies use cloud computing to power their computing infrastructure, as it allows them to scale up or down easily. This also keeps businesses asset-light, while the burden of purchasing computing power falls to the providers, like Amazon or Alphabet. It's also necessary for AI proliferation, as few companies have the year-round need for massive computing power required to develop an AI model.\n\nThis allows cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud (Alphabet's cloud business) to charge a premium for using their computing resources, turning this business into a powerful subscription model.\n\nIn Q4, AWS posted revenue growth of 19% year over year and converted 37% of that into operating profit. While some may view AWS as a side business for Amazon, I like to think of Amazon as more of a cloud computing business than a commerce business. While AWS only made up 17% of Amazon's total sales in 2024, it accounted for an incredible 58% of Amazon's operating income. That shows how profitable cloud computing can be, making it a lucrative business for Amazon to invest in.\n\nGoogle Cloud isn't as dominant as AWS, but it still provides a meaningful contribution to Alphabet's business. In Q4, Google Cloud revenue rose 30% year over year to $12 billion (for reference, AWS generated $28.8 billion in revenue) with an operating margin of 17.5%. Clearly, Google Cloud has some work to do before reaching AWS-like profit levels, but it is growing at a faster pace.\n\nGoogle Cloud also doesn't contribute as much to the profit picture as AWS does, as Alphabet's primary business, advertising, has inherently higher profit margins than Amazon's commerce business. Still, if Google Cloud can maintain these growth levels for many years, it will become a substantial part of Alphabet's business.\n\nCloud computing is a massive trend that has yet to fully play out. The investments in this business allow every competitor to capture once-in-a-lifetime business opportunities (as Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy put it), so investors should be cheering on Alphabet and Amazon's hefty capital expenditures.",

Johns Hopkins University\n\nCarbon-dated tombs were uncovered at the site, featuring six skeletons as well as gold and silver jewelry, cookware, weapons and pottery. The team also discovered four clay cylinders containing a form of alphabetic print.\n\nThe clay objects \u2014 about the length of a finger \u2014 were perforated, and Schwartz believes they were strung together during their use and operated as an ancient label.\n\n\u201cMaybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian region is about 875 miles north of the great pyramids of Giza, where ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphics as written communication at least 500 years later.\n\nResearchers suspect the clay writing was used as a label. jhu\n\nJust south of Syria in modern-day Lebanon around the 11th century BC, the Phonecians \u2014 from whom the English word \u201cphonics\u201d derives \u2014 are credited with creating \u201cthe prototype for all alphabets in the world,\u201d according to UNESCO.\n\n\u201cAnd this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now,\u201d said Schwartz.",

TSLA\u2019s forthcoming robotaxis into Uber\u2019s platform.\n\nWhat Happened: Speaking with Bloomberg TV at the FII conference in Miami on Friday, Khosrowshahi revealed that Musk plans to roll out Tesla's robotaxi service without external partnerships.\n\n\u201cThey want to build it alone, so to some extent in Austin, we and Waymo will be competing with Tesla when they launch,\u201d he said, referencing Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG GOOGL autonomous vehicle unit.\n\nKhosrowshahi believes that Uber would be a logical platform for Tesla drivers, as it introduces variable demand to the autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystem.\n\nSee Also: Trump Team Threatens To Cut Ukraine\u2019s Access To Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink Over Minerals Dispute: Report\n\nUber has intensified its focus on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology in recent years, forging over a dozen manufacturing partnerships and investing in multiple self-driving tech firms since 2023. The company is preparing to roll out autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin next month, followed by an expansion to Atlanta this summer.\n\nWhy It Matters: This revelation comes after Khosrowshahi expressed optimism about a potential partnership between Uber and Tesla for robotaxis. In a recent interview, he stated that he hoped to convince Tesla to work with Uber, emphasizing that no one wants to compete against Tesla if they can help it.\n\nUber halted its in-house self-driving car development in 2020, selling its autonomous vehicle division to Aurora. Reflecting on the decision, the CEO explained that during the pandemic, he prioritized capital efficiency, as the company was incurring massive losses in robotaxi development. He acknowledged that hardware was not Uber's core strength.\n\nThe launch of Tesla's robotaxis and Waymo's expanded operations could impact Uber's ride volume growth and reduce its commission rates, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, Waymo offers driverless rides through its app in key markets like San Francisco and is set to expand to Miami next year.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Tesla",

The company, whose CEO Eric Jing led Baidu\u2019s AI-powered smartphone and smart speaker Xiaodu unit, raised a $60 million seed round last June.\n\nAccording to its website, Genspark is an AI agent engine which generates custom pages called Sparkpages in real-time based on user queries. It claims to offer users better results in less time than alternatives. Indeed, it says it has developed a feature capable of using multiple AI models that work together to conduct in-depth research online.\n\nGenspark is one of a number of startups trying to disrupt the search engine market dominated by Google. Tech experts say AI-generated search results can offer a single answer with citations, which could provide a better user experience for searchers compared to Google\u2019s link lists.\n\nGoogle Looking For its Own AI Answers\n\nGoogle itself is experimenting with AI search results with its AI Overviews service powered by the Google Gemini Large Language Model, while OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT recently integrated internet search capabilities. Another big player in the AI search space, Perplexity, has raised funds valuing it at $9 billion.\n\nAt present Genspark has over 2 million monthly active users. That compares with figures from Semrush last year which showed that Google has 5.9 million searches per minute and 276 million unique monthly visitors in the U.S. alone. That\u2019s a big mountain to shake but the potential of AI to disrupt the search market\u2014as in every other sector of business and life it seems\u2014is clear.\n\nIs GOOGL a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOn TipRanks, GOOGL has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 27 Buy and 10 Hold ratings.

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 21, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, C3.ai, Inc. AI, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nIs C3.ai Stock the Next Palantir (and a Buy)?\n\nSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) company Palantir Technologies Inc.\u2019s shares have soared 388.7% in the past year, a noteworthy comeback after the stock took a beating in its initial public offering.\n\nAnother SaaS company, C3.ai, Inc., providing AI-based applications, has become a Wall Street darling as it continues to get a lot of business from the government. C3.ai\u2019s shares have gained 17.5% in the past year, with further potential based on recent accelerated revenue growth increases. Does this mean C3.ai can rival Palantir, and is the stock a buy? Let\u2019s delve into it \u2013\n\nReasons to Be Bullish on PLTR Stock\n\nPalantir ended last year with revenues of $2.87 billion, up 29% from the prior year. Palantir\u2019s top line improved as more customers began to use the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which can automate tasks surpassing human capabilities.\n\nAIP\u2019s popularity has lured both new and existing customers. The net dollar retention rate in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased, indicating that current customers are spending more on Palantir\u2019s products.\n\nWith existing customers generating substantial business for Palantir, the company needs to spend less on revenue generation, resulting in strong growth margins. Palantir\u2019s adjusted operating income did improve last year.\n\nWhile Palantir\u2019s total contract value shot up in the fourth quarter of 2024, its remaining deal value (RDV) climbed 40% to $5.4 billion from a year ago. Palantir\u2019s growth is likely to accelerate this year, with RDV exceeding last year\u2019s revenues.\n\nThe company also anticipates further growth due to increasing demand for AI software to enhance productivity. Analysts expect spending on AI software worldwide to jump fourfold between the current year and 2030, generating billions in annual revenues.\n\nReasons to Be Bullish on AI Stock\n\nC3.ai\u2019s revenues soared 29% year over year to $94.3 million in the fiscal second quarter as the company\u2019s ready-to-use AI programs were appreciated by its current customers. C3.ai generated most of its income from subscriptions, reflecting strength through recurring revenues.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "2025 is getting closer, and investors need to start thinking about how they want their portfolios positioned headed into the new year. Fund managers often make big changes before the new year, which can ignite a \"Santa Claus rally.\" This effect pushes stock prices up in December, so individual investors must start considering their moves now.\n\nTwo stocks that I will likely increase my position in before the new year are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). Both of these stocks could see some interest before the new year, as they are relatively cheap compared to many stocks in the market.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company and has a dominant grip on the search engine market. While there were some worries earlier this year that Alphabet's grip on this function could be in danger, it's clear that those fears were overblown. Alphabet has proven itself nimble enough to implement changes (like the generative AI-powered search summary) and will likely be able to copy successful features from rival search products before it sees too many defectors.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet is seeing huge demand in its Google Cloud division. That division, which is thriving as its clients increase their computing power to develop AI models, has many unique tools available. Google Cloud's popularity and usage have soared, leading to revenue rising 35% year over year to $11.4 billion.\n\nOverall, Alphabet's third-quarter revenue increased 15% year over year to $88.3 billion, which is not bad for the fourth-biggest company in the world. Still, it's valued at an incredibly low price, with Alphabet's stock trading for just about 22 times forward earnings. Considering the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) trades at 24.6 times forward earnings, Alphabet could see a rally next year as investors look to find some cheaper stocks with strong growth potential in the market.\n\n2. PayPal\n\nFor about three years, PayPal hasn't received much love from the market. Its stock price peaked at more than $300 per share in mid-2021 and pretty much declined until mid-2024. It has seen some interest recently, with the stock rising 50% since the beginning of July, but there's still plenty of room to go.\n\nPayPal's CEO, Alex Chriss, joined the company in September 2023 and is leading a transformation. He laid out his vision to make the company more efficient and focus on what PayPal does best, rather than becoming an app that is used to do everything. This has worked out well in recent quarters, as PayPal's business is showing signs of life.\n\nPayPal's active accounts increased slightly in Q3, marking the first growth since first-quarter 2023. Transaction margin also ticked up -- something it hasn't done in a couple of years. These slight improvements helped PayPal's revenue rise 6% year over year, which isn't all that impressive. However, investors need to focus on profits with PayPal, as it isn't a growth story anymore. Operating income was up 19% to $1.4 billion, which is outstanding.\n\nWith its cash flows, PayPal is repurchasing a ton of stock and retired 28 million shares in Q3 alone. With about 1 billion shares outstanding, that means PayPal retired nearly 3% of its shares in one quarter. Most companies would be happy if they could do that in a year, yet PayPal is doing it much faster. This is occurring for two reasons.\n\nFirst, PayPal's management devotes all of its cash flows to repurchasing shares. It can afford to do this because its balance sheet is in a healthy spot. Second, it's a good idea because the stock is cheap. At the start of Q3, PayPal's stock traded for around 12 times forward earnings and 14 times trailing earnings.\n\nPYPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nPYPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nPayPal's stock is no longer as cheap after the rally, so the repurchases will be less effective, but it still has plenty of room to run, considering that it's still well below the S&P 500's price tag.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if PayPal's rally continues to the end of the year, making it a great stock to purchase now.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer opened Monday\u2019s Mad Money episode with the observation that CEOs gathered at the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl game weren't just there for football. They were there to talk business, politics, and the economy. According to Cramer, their conversations revealed what\u2019s truly shaping corporate America\u2019s mindset right now, with the biggest one having to do with the current U.S. President:\n\n\"Nobody can figure out Donald Trump. These CEOs are baffled\u2026 They like that he's attacking the federal bureaucracy, but they don't understand why Elon Musk is wasting time on the small stuff.\"\n\nHe also noticed that they appear more relaxed, confident and bullish under the new regime, compared to the previous one under Biden.\n\n\"There\u2019s been a shocking amount of new business going on\u2026 CEOs no longer feel like the government is out to get them. Even Democratic donors can't believe how disrespected they were by the Biden White House.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that all CEOs think Wall Street valuations are stretched, although Cramer is still bullish.\n\n\u201cThey almost all think the stock market\u2019s too high, but their own stocks are too low. When I tell them the market\u2019s actually undervalued and I like their stocks, they nod. But they think I\u2019m a dreamer.\u201d\n\nFinally, of course, the big theme was around Trump\u2019s tariffs and their impact on the markets.\n\n\u201cThey all hate Trump\u2019s tariff plans. These CEOs think they\u2019re disorganized, don\u2019t make sense, won\u2019t raise money, and are terrible for business. They\u2019re free traders at heart and totally baffled by Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 18. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Alphabet Inc.

That\u2019s just one piece of YouTube\u2019s business, not including subscription revenue from services like YouTube TV or YouTube Premium. Last fall, parent company Alphabet said YouTube\u2019s total revenue topped $50 billion for the 12-month period that ended in September 2024 for the first time.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOverall, Alphabet reported Q4 revenue of $96.47 billion and net income of $26.54 billion, or $2.15 per share. That was shy of the $96.67 billion analysts expected on the top line, while the tech giant beat the earnings estimate of EPS of $2.13.\n\nThe increase in YouTube ad revenue was driven by the 2024 U.S. election \u2014 with both political parties almost doubling their spending compared with the 2020 elections, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said on the earnings call. On election day (Nov. 5), more 45 million viewers in the U.S. watched content related to the election on YouTube, according to the company.\n\nAmid its continued growth in search and video, Alphabet has been investing heavily in AI to keep pace with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta. Last month U.S. tech companies were rattled by results touted by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which said it developed a new large language model (LLM) that was far more efficient than other systems.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said the company expects to invest approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. That is significantly higher than Wall Street analysts\u2019 capex estimate of $59.7 billion, according to Visible Alpha.\n\n\u201cQ4 was a strong quarter driven by our leadership in AI and momentum across the business,\u201d Pichai said in prepared remarks. \u201cWe are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficiencies\u2026 Our results show the power of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation and the continued strength of our core businesses.\u201d Asked about DeepSeek on the call, Pichai lauded the start-up as having a \u201ctremendous team\u201d that has \u201cdone very, very good work\u201d but said Google\u2019s latest AI models are \u201csome of the most efficient models out there.\u201d\n\nPichai said that the \u201cAI-powered Google Cloud portfolio is seeing stronger customer demand.\u201d For Q4, Google Cloud revenue came in at $11.96 billion, up 30.1% year over year but short of Wall Street expectations of $12.1 billion.\n\nTogether, Google Cloud and YouTube ended 2024 with an annual revenue run rate of $110 billion, according to Pichai. For the full year, YouTube\u2019s ad revenue totaled $36.15 billion.\n\nOn the AI front, in December YouTube announced a partnership with CAA to let talent identify \u2014 and take down \u2014 AI-generated fakes of themselves uploaded to the video platform. YouTube is trying to convey the message to Hollywood that it is trying to be a good partner to creative industries by taking proactive steps to build \u201cresponsible AI.\u201d\n\nYouTube continues to dominate viewing on TV relative to other streamers. In December 2024, YouTube viewing on connected TVs in the U.S. increased to capture a record 11.1% share of TV usage among streaming platforms ahead of Netflix (8.5%), Prime Video (4.0%), Hulu (2.5%) and Disney+ (2.1%), according to Nielsen.\n\nYouTube\u2019s scale is massive: Worldwide, users watch more than 1 billion hours on average of YouTube content on TVs daily, according to the company. More than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is facing potentially major changes as the result of the Justice Department\u2019s successful antitrust case against the company. A federal court last year held that Google broke the law by inking multibillion-dollar deals to make its search engine the default on browsers and smartphones including devices from Apple and Samsung. The DOJ\u2019s proposed remedies include forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser. The judge overseeing the case is expected to rule on a remedy after a two-week trial scheduled for April 2025.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Mary Long, joined today by David Meier. David, good to see you. Thanks for being here.\n\nDavid Meier: Great to see you, too. Thank you for having me.\n\nMary Long: Always a pleasure. The past two days, we've been talking tariffs on the show as that's been dominating a lot of the news cycle. But today, we get what seems to be a reprieve from that talk and gives us an opportunity to focus back on companies. We'll start with a familiar name that reported earnings recently, and then we'll hit on something that investors have probably heard about but maybe don't have too many details on. That familiar name is, in fact, Alphabet. Big news with Alphabet earnings is that Cloud revenue fell short of analyst expectations. But I want to give a little context to that number because that segment did see 30% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, brought in $12 billion. A year ago, the Cloud unit brought in just over nine billion dollars in revenue. Thirty percent growth on several billion dollars is no small feat. Wall Street isn't pleased. We know that they're pretty obsessed with meeting expectations. David, we take the long-term view. What say you? Does this result 30% growth to $12 billion in Cloud revenue? Does that worry a long-term investor?\n\nDavid Meier: Nope. Not one bit.\n\nMary Long: Next question.\n\nDavid Meier: We're talking a small miss, but we're also talking a very big market that is only getting bigger. Sure, you might miss a little here, a little there along the way, but at the same time we know that sometimes you gain a little more here and gain a little more there along the way. On average, the misses and the shortfalls tend to negate each other. But Cloud is not going away. In some sense, it's a little comical that this happens all the time, but it is the nature of the game now. It is what are expectations. I want them to be high. I want this segment of the company to be growing quickly. I came a little short. That's just the way it is. But at the same time, if you have those lock V expectations and investors have bid up prices, then, these little misses can turn into down days like Google/Alphabet is seeing.\n\nMary Long: Another, I'll say eye-popping number that came out of this report is that Alphabet plans to spend about $75 billion on capital expenditures by the end of their fiscal year. That's up from 52.5 billion dollar in CapEx last year. This is a story we talk about all the time. Talked about it last week when we're talking about Meta and Microsoft. It's not new to this quarter. Big Tech is spending a lot on CapEx to build out AI infrastructure. But I want to hone in on the comparison among companies here because the narrative that we often share and that we're told when we talk about Capex is, these hyperscalers have to keep spending. If they want to keep competitive, they got to shell out money. As an investor, if you buy that, then how do you actually take these massive CapEx numbers and put them in context? We've got Alphabet saying they're going to spend $75 billion. As a refresher, Meta said that they'd increase CapEx to 60 and $65 billion. Microsoft wants to close out their fiscal year, which ends in June, having spent 80 billion. How do you compare these across different companies? These are all massive companies, but is Microsoft's CapEx \"better\". Is their spend better than Alphabet is just because, hey, they're going to shell out $5 billion more cash?\n\nDavid Meier: No, the wrong way to do it is to compare the absolute dollars. Because again, Google brought in a lot of revenue. Microsoft brought in a lot of revenue. Meta brought in a lot of revenue. They still see demand. That's why they're making the investment. The unfortunate thing is, in order to compare them, we need to see the results down the road in time, because what we're looking for is not how much did you spend, but it's actually how much did you earn on the capital that you invested, hence the term return on invested capital. That's the way to look at how well these companies are doing. We get that from, how much revenue did you generate? How much profit did you generate after all the expenses that you needed to make in order to run those businesses? How much cash flow was available as a result of all the profits that you make? It's that cash flow return on investment that is the true line of demarcation. If we go back and look at the history of Amazon and what the ROICs that they were putting up when they were building out AWS, they were phenomenal and that's the reason that they spent billions upon billions building that business.\n\nMary Long: We kicked off this conversation by focusing on Google's Cloud business, but at its core, this is an advertising company, and that business seems to continue to do pretty well. We'll focus in on YouTube in particular. YouTube ad sales brought in $10.5 billion in revenue. That was a record for the company. Relative to other streamers, YouTube dominates viewing on TV. I am not a YouTube person, so that always surprises me. In December of 2024, YouTube viewing captured more than 11% of TV. Netflix, for comparison, owns about 8.5% of that pie. Streaming that's happening on connected TV. Worldwide, users watch more than a billion hours of YouTube content on TV each day. What does YouTube understand about video that maybe other streamers could imitate?\n\nDavid Meier: They know what their viewer wants. It really does get as simple as that. I'm going to use myself as an example and try to bring some light to my comment. I'm a golfer. I go to YouTube, and there are a couple of content creators who talk about the golf swing and how you can make improvements. I like music, so I tend to click on things about guitar or new bands that I just heard of and see what they have to offer, things like that. I like snowboarding. I just got back from a snowboarding trip, so I was like, hey, let me go see what cool things people are doing on their snowboards. You know who knows exactly what I want? YouTube. It's amazing. They see what I look at. In my feed, there are always new things for me to watch. That's the beauty of it. That's actually the beauty of Netflix, as well. Netflix knows what people want to watch, and not only do they put that in front of them, you get basically a curated list of things. Hey, this might be something you might be interested. But like Netflix and for YouTube, it also is a way of feeding back information to content creators.\n\nIf your content is something that people want, then YouTube will say, hey, essentially make more of this. We'll make it worth your while. We'll share some of that advertising revenue with you. The whole thing is one giant feedback loop. It is absolutely incredible to see that these two companies are essentially 25% of streaming TV usage. That's amazing. It's because, again, they have the algorithms that know how to see what people are viewing, translate that into what people might want to view in the future, send that signal out to content creators so they can create an incentive for them to create more content and just keep going and going.\n\nMary Long: All these business segments that we've talked about today roll up into Google. But Alphabet is more than just Google. Almost all of Alphabet's revenue comes from Google, and again, that includes not just the Cloud segment, not just YouTube, but Maps, Gmail, Drive, smartphones. So much of what we think of when we think of Alphabet. But again, there's more to this company than just Google. With that in mind, how do you value a company like this? There's a lot of moonshots that Alphabet is working on, and the results of those are to be determined. Is that baked into the stock price today? How do you think about that as an investor in this company?\n\nDavid Meier: That's an awesome question, and it's actually one that investors have debated for many years. It was interesting. I'll take you back to when Ruth Porat came on as CFO, and she was like, basically, we are going to be more disciplined in how we invest capital. Some of those moonshots that were actually cordoned off into a venture's business, they actually didn't get funded. Some of them lost their funding, but not everything does. But the reason I say that is because the best way to value Google, in my opinion, is essentially to do a sum of the parts. The last I checked, there were at least like 12 or 15 properties that had a billion users. That's a business in and of itself. If you wanted to, you could spin that off and it would live on its own. Essentially, you take those properties and to the best of your ability, you see what comps you can find. You take the information that Google gives you in all of its public filings, and you try to figure out what each individual property is worth, and then add them up at the end of the day. Waymo used to sit over in the venture side of things.\n\nThere was stuff about how do we lengthen human lives? We're making investments there. There's all these other things. That's essentially an option. It's a call option. How much value you assign to that? Well, you could probably do a little bit of math. But essentially, it's the properties that are more mature, generating revenue, generating cash flow that deliver the bulk of it. As those moonshots start to show signs of life, that's when you can start saying, well, if I know how much I'm paying for these mature properties, if I get this moonshot for free or I don't know, for a dollar in terms of stock price, is that worth? Is that call option worth taking? Sometime it is. Essentially, to wrap that up, it's the value of the mature properties plus whatever option value you assign to the ultra long term investments that are making, that's what makes up the overall value of Alphabet.\n\nMary Long: Anything else that you want to call out from Alphabet earnings or that stuck out to you before we move on to our next story of the day?\n\nDavid Meier: I will just say the stock is off today. This is one of those situations where Google is doing so many things and is moving in my opinion, in a good direction forward. It's these dips that can provide opportunity. I would just say to investors, even though Google is a multi trillion dollar company, it's still doing amazing things, expecting double digit growth, low teens growth for the next 2-5 years. That's a pretty incredible opportunity for a business this size. I would just say, keep an eye on it.\n\nMary Long: It's the cheapest of all the Magnificent 7 stocks. I believe that's worth mentioning, too. Speaking of doing great things, we'll move on to Palantir. You mentioned that Alphabet is down a bit today. Palantir Technology was up 24% yesterday and up 40% since the start of the year. The Morning Brew wrote on X, Palantir being up 25% today. They wrote this yesterday. Is even more impressive when you consider that 100% of their investors have no idea what it actually does. David, I've called you into the chat to help out those investors. Tell us what is it that this mysterious company actually does?\n\nDavid Meier: I'm so happy to help here. The way to think about Palantir is that Palantir has developed a technology platform that essentially helps companies analyze their data for a fee at a 30,000 foot level. That's what the company does. Whether it's, optimization and whether it's analytics, whether it's AI, whatever it is, the goal of Palantir or its mission is to say, hey, you as companies, you have all this data. Let us help you make better decisions. Get more out of it. Improve your customer's experience, all these things. That's what Palantir just lives to do. I think the most interesting example, and I love to tell this story when I first learned about Palantir, was the Formula 1 race car. They work with Ferrari, and Ferrari basically made a marketing video, so it was designed to be sensational. But they essentially Ferrari said, look, Palantir in real time helps our car get around the track faster. Formula 1 racing, we're not talking, hey, let's find two seconds, let's find five seconds.\n\nWe're talking tens of seconds. In this partnership, they were taking all the data from the car, running it through analysis, and basically saying, hey, make these adjustments to the car. Tell the driver, this is what you can do. You're a little slow here. You're a little fast here. Your fuel efficiency is here. Change the pressure in the tires. All these things. They're essentially happening in real time to help Ferrari win a race. You can extrapolate that to any business. You're not necessarily driving a race car, but you want your business to get better. You want your business to get stronger. You want your business to grow faster. That's what Palantir does.\n\nMary Long: That example is such a good one to hear because I think depending on your effect, you can hear the words data analysis and AI and either get really excited about that potential or you can be cynical because it sounds like a bunch of buzzwords. That said, Palantir stock is valued at over 170 times forward earnings. If you're somebody listening and you're looking out and you're seeing this wild news cycle that we're sitting in the middle of and you're sitting on the end of all this market uncertainty and the ups downs of the corrections of the back and forth that we saw earlier this week, and you see the stock that shoots up, you see an immensely confident CEO. What do you say to the listener who sees all that and says, I want to ride that race car?[laughs]\n\nDavid Meier: [laughs] No. Again, another great question and it is without a doubt that Palantir is doing amazing things, in terms of the growth of their own business, how they're helping their customers, whether they're commercial or in the private sector or the public sector, helping governments. You can have your own opinion of Alex Carp. He's a unique individual and very passionate about this industry. But let's just go back to something that Warren Buffett always says, and price is what you pay, value is what you get. Now, we just need to be careful. This stock has been bid up. If you look at the valuation we can see that the market essentially says this company is going to continue to do amazing things, and it's going to turn those amazing things into more revenue, more profits, more cash flow. We just have to decide as investors, is the risk of potentially losing money worth the returns that are embedded in the stock price? I would say that the risk is probably higher than the returns right now given these prices, but that does not take away from the fact that, again, what Palantir doing, where it's doing it, the industry that it plays in, amazing things. I would have to say it's better for investors to be patient right now.\n\nMary Long: David Meier, always truly wonderful to have you on the show. Thank you so much for demystifying Palantir for us and for reminding us of the age-old adage that patience is a virtue.\n\nDavid Meier: You're very welcome. Thank you for having me.\n\nMary Long: [MUSIC] Ever notice when a bunch of different publications start talking about a one-snitch topic and I'll start covering that topic from a pretty similar angle, you may be looking at the work of a Black bag or Crisis PR firm. Up next, Ricky Mulvey talks with television writer and novelist Jordan Harper about the world of public relations and how not just celebrities but corporations try to shape the public discourse.\n\nRicky Mulvey: The angle we're getting into is about Crisis public relations, Black Bag PR. It's central to your book, everybody knows, which is the Hollywood angle of it. But I think the fundamentals of this are actually applicable to our investing audience because investors are going to see the work of Crisis PR firms in the companies they follow, especially when things go awry anytime a company needs to spin a story or change public opinion on something. We'll get into it a bit later, but I'm immediately thinking of big food. Before we get to all that, to set the table, what got you interested in the world of crisis public relations? How did you see it?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, as you mentioned, I am a writer and producer for television alongside my novels, and I was working on a pilot based on James Elroy's novel, LA Confidential, which is one of my favorite books and very applicable to what I write about. We were making it for CBS and during the time we were filming it, we started to hear rumors and whispers that there was going to be a big article that was going to come out about the head of CBS Les Moonves and we thought it was going to blow up the network and we just waited and it didn't come. Then we filmed the pilot, we got it done. I did not go to series. Les Moonves did not pick it up. Then a few months after that, the article did come out. It's a very famous Ronan Farrow and a lot of this stuff came out in Ronan Farrow's book Catch and Kill. But having been on the inside of it and watched it play out from the inside made me very aware of how much working in Hollywood, I had learned secrets that didn't make the Light of Day or made the Light of Day years later. Also working on LA Confidential, which is an amazing epic Neo Noir set in the 40s, I wanted to take that energy and tell a story right now in Los Angeles, and it occurred to me that a Crisis PR manager is actually a perfect, neo-noir character to tell a really dark twisted story about the modern world.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I know when you're researching stories while you're writing fiction, you're trying to pull a lot from reality. I think one example is you followed police scanners around just to see what's going on in the city of Los Angeles to gather inspiration for your work. When you were researching the Crisis PR industry, the people that work in it, what was some of the work you did to find out about what they do?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, I did the basic things you do, starting with Wikipedia, which I bring up because I do encourage people to go read the Wikipedia page for crisis management and crisis communication. The reason I recommend it is you will read it and you will see that it has clearly been written by crisis managers and crisis communication specialists because controlling information is the key to what they do. Not just information but the phrases used, the words used, and it's a great example. But I did go beyond that. Obviously, like I said, I worked in Hollywood. I still do, and I had talked to a lot of people who had been in bad situations, and I talked to those people and learned how it was handled. Then I did reach out and sit down with some Black Bag PR people for some really odious men here in Hollywood, and they were very open with me. Obviously, I can't name them. I gave them confidentiality, but they were very blunt about the tools they use and what they do.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Let's get into some of those tools. One thing that these Crisis PR agents need to do is build relationships with journalists at very large media organizations. What did you learn about how they accomplish building those relationships?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, it's something you can see in politicians and reporters in Washington. You can see it in LA with entertainment reporters. Access is a key thing that all reporters need. They need people to talk to, they need to be able to get inside, and they can't burn those bridges because they need constant access to access. Cultivating those relationships, just treating reporters like human beings, very little of this is done in back alleys, very little of it is said out loud. It's just you form the relationships, you become friends with the people, and then they treat you like friends. You can trade on that. You can trade on your access to the powerful people you protect, and you build this network and you use that to set the narrative. There's a very famous idea in crisis management called the Lead Steer Theory. Once you're aware of it, you'll start to see it all the time, which is the concept of the lead steer theory, and this was said to me in very blunt words by a Black Bag PR person, the presser cattle.\n\nWhat you want to do, they told me, is find a lead steer. Tell your story to that lead steer. Now, that's a big media organization. The New York Times was given to me as the absolute best lead steer you can find. You feed them your story, you get them to publish it with your take as the lead take, and now you have set the tone for all the stories that are going to follow because every reporter who researches this is going to start with the New York Times. Now, it doesn't have to be the New York Times. It just has to be a big publication. But when you can set the tone, then you've already won the war, so that's a big part of what they do.\n\nRicky Mulvey: A lot of media is drawing off what other journalists are doing, especially when you're trying to make so much stuff. After I read your book, everybody knows, which I've recommended on the show, and I really enjoyed it. Jordan, it was one of those books where I felt myself slowing down reading, just as a general reader, and I found myself gaining momentum ripping through the pages of that book. Thank you for that. It's that gripping read.\n\nJordan Harper: Thank you.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I think I'm seeing this pattern, especially for big food. We have this big debate around ultra-processed food, and I think there's a general trend where people in the United States want to eat healthier. They're thinking more about what's going into what they eat. I don't think that the big processed food companies are taking this lying down. Now, here's a few examples of what I've seen. One is in the Atlantic, there's an article where it's like coke, Twinkies, skittles, and whole grain bread. Who's to say what ultra-processed food is because there's an ingredient in whole-grain bread that could count it is ultra-processed food? There's also a Wall Street Journal article where it's highlighting this NIH study, finding these interim results where 18 people are reporting that they're feeling just as full and satisfied on an ultra-processed food, diet processed food, and whole healthy foods. I'm getting to this with the lead steer PR strategy because what I'm starting to see is maybe the work of Crisis PR agents, trying to sow confusion, trying to sow doubt in the American public for things that maybe they know intuitively is true. If you eat a piece of beef, it's going to make you feel full in a different way than a meal from McDonald's will. I think I'm seeing the work of Crisis PR here, and that's one of the reasons I wanted to bring you on the show. Bounce that off you. Could there be Crisis PR at work with a lot of these big food companies trying to combat this trend?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, I think in the large sense, yes, I do want to differentiate. Crisis PR is usually done in the face of an actual crisis to be dealt with. But Black Bag PR can cover a lot of different aspects, including what you're talking about. The history of food industries manipulating the press in America goes back decades and decades, and they work hand in hand with scientists who they fund the studies of. They also have access to 1,000 studies, but they're only going to write articles about one. A very famous example of this is the battle between sugar and fat that has occurred in our diets in America and how the entire fat-free craze was powered by Black Bag PR about people highlighting a single study that suggested that fat was what was causing so many of our health problems when a large majority of studies suggested it was in fact sugar. The difference between fat and sugar is fat appears in a lot of different foods, but there isn't such a thing as big fat. Sugar, however, has a very powerful voice behind it. Yes, you do see this Black Bag PR work and big food and I think your examples are exactly right. The thing you have to ask yourself when you encounter the media, you can't let this knowledge of media manipulation shut you off from the news. It just means you have to become a more sophisticated consumer of news.\n\nThe first thing you have to ask is the famous phrase qui bono or who benefits? Who benefits from this article at this moment? Who suggested it? If you ask me, I think it should be just a tenet of reporter ethics that any contact with a publicist should be mentioned in the article, because how is that not news? How is it not news that this idea for an article was brought to you by somebody with a vested interest in this story being told? I think the basic thing at work here is a weaponization of the contradictions inherent in so-called objective news gathering. Reporters have to put on a false identity of objectivity because no one is truly objective. To do that, they have to contort their beliefs and they have to give both sides a voice. They have to allow for crazy ideas to be presented, and they can't just say, hey, here's a crazy idea. We're seeing it more and more and absolutely corporations have to engage in this sometimes. Well, they don't have to, they choose to. They would say they have to in order to protect their shareholders, but I think there's a lot of different ways to protect your shareholders. I could give you an example of the alternative if you'd like.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Go for it.\n\nJordan Harper: People look at Crisis PR as something that came out of the '80s in a lot of ways, and there are two case studies you can look at. There's Three Mile Island, which is a terrible environmental disaster that was caused by corporate malfeasance, and it was covered up and they used pressure to try and keep the story in the alternative to that is the Tylenol murders, where a man in Chicago was dosing bottles of Tylenol with cyanide and people were dying. Instead of covering anything up or denying responsibility, even though they truly weren't responsible, Tylenol made the choice to settle with all the victims, to take full responsibility, to pull Tylenol off the shelves, and they handled it in just an open and honest way and Tylenol is fine. Everybody still takes Tylenol. They solved the problem through honesty and admitting that it was a problem. It's when corporations choose not to do that, that they engage in the cover-ups.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I want to get back to the listener, those consuming media. You said one thing to ask as you read news is who benefits. You also don't want to dismiss all journalism out of hand with the cynical view that everything is controlled by Black Bag and Crisis PR. But for those listening, what are some signs that they're seeing the work of Crisis PR or Black Bag PR in the news they're watching or the news that they're reading?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, I think the number 1 thing to look for, and it's a tricky thing to look for because it's invisible is what are the questions that aren't being asked and what are the ideas being assumed without being questioned? What's missing? That is the trickiest thing to think about if you're not very familiar with the subject. I will say, a great thing to do to educate yourself on this is to look up some news articles if you're able to on something you are tremendously familiar with. As somebody who's worked in Hollywood, I've had an opportunity to do this a lot reading articles in the trades about TV shows I've worked on. I can always see the gaps, and I can see what's missing and I can see what's wrong. The trick is to turn the page and read the next story and assume every gap and mistake that was in that story is in this one. Again, without dismissing it outright, I know that there's a trend now to dismiss legacy media as some wholly owned or wholly constructed entity and that's COPE. That's weak-minded.\n\nIt's just silly, but you can say that and still say it is all shaped, it's all controlled, and look for things like statements that were released by a publicist. You have to ask yourself, did the person that this statement is being attributed to even read this statement before it was published? The answer is often probably not. Be aware of that. Look for things that sound like PR speak coming out of the mouths of people who shouldn't be speaking that way. Again, look for the agendas that aren't being stated, look for the assumptions, and look for trends. The way you're pointing out a trend, while there's been five articles saying, ultra-process food is good for you. That seems fishy. Well, that is fishy and be aware of it. Again, that doesn't mean one fact in the article is false, or the idea is false, or that idea is false, obviously. Again, the other thing to think about is specifically, who is powerful and who has the money and means to shift narratives that could profit from this take. You can't just wave your hands and say, It's rich people. You can't just wave your hands and say it's the elites. You have to find these people have names. That's what you want to know is who with a name is benefiting?\n\nMary Long: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other top AI news you should pay attention to.\n\nLinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said in a latest program on CNBC that the DeepSeek breakthrough was not \u201cnews\u201d for him and maany tech insiders as he believed sooner or later more efficient models would be launched. However, he sees China\u2019s rise in the AI race as surprising:\n\n\u201cI do think that the thing that is news is, well, look, as we\u2019ve been saying, China is in the game. This is actually, in fact, a game-on competition, and it was resoundingly demonstrated that way. There is good, useful work that comes out of it.\u201d\n\nThe tech investor believes efficiency will lead to more use cases and usage:\n\n\u201cSay, for example, you can train a model on a thousand GPUs, but you can make it much better on 10,000 GPUs. You will, in a lot of cases, always spend for the 10,000 GPUs or the 100,000 GPUs because if your coding model is even 20% better with that and you think that there are billions of people who could be using and engaging with that around the world, that\u2019s actually worth it at that kind of cost. So, the fact that you\u2019re trying to do efficiency \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing. All of the American companies will also get to points where they\u2019re focusing on efficiency.

NASDAQ: GOOGL hit an all-time high in early February before experiencing a post-earnings pullback. The 10% decline in recent weeks may have shaken some investors, but this could be a golden buying opportunity for those paying attention.\n\nWhile the earnings report contained a revenue miss that spooked the market, it's worth remembering that Alphabet still posted record-breaking revenue, driven by a 30% surge in Google Cloud growth. Combine that with the stock approaching oversold levels and a continuing wave of almost universal bullish analyst support, and the argument for stepping in at current levels becomes hard to ignore.\n\nGet Alphabet alerts: Sign Up\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Earnings Reveal Strength Beyond the Headline Revenue Miss\n\nAlphabet's February earnings report may have been overshadowed by its revenue miss, but a closer look reveals plenty of reasons to stay bullish. While total revenue came in slightly below expectations, it still hit a record, driven by strong ad revenue and accelerating cloud growth, the latter helping to reaffirm the company's role as the market leader in the space.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai wasn't slow about emphasizing the momentum behind Alphabet's AI initiatives, which are expected to drive even greater revenue expansion in 2025 and beyond.

Earnings Growth 14.94% See Full Analysis\n\nWhile the stock's subsequent drop suggested investors were rattled by the revenue miss, Wall Street's biggest names remain exceedingly bullish.\n\nFor example, Piper Sandler, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup all reiterated their bullish ratings in the aftermath of the report, with price targets ranging as high as $229. From where Alphabet closed last week, that implies nearly 25% upside from current levels.\n\nFor those wondering whether this pullback is a buying opportunity or a warning sign, analysts seem to be answering loud and clear: Alphabet's long-term trajectory remains firmly intact.\n\nConfidence Remains, But Analysts Are Watching Growth Trajectory Closely\n\nIt has to be noted that the team over at DZ Bank stood out among the analysts covering Alphabet, as they actually downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold in the aftermath of the report. The revenue miss undoubtedly raised some concerns about Alphabet's near-term growth stability. Although Google Cloud's impressive expansion is helping to offset this, the DZ Bank team is waiting to see whether Alphabet can reaccelerate revenue growth in the coming quarters before turning more aggressively bullish. However, their refreshed $198 price target still suggests the stock is undervalued at its current levels.\n\nAdditionally, while analysts remain confident, some have trimmed their price targets, suggesting that valuation concerns are creeping in. A P/E ratio that remains above some of its tech peers means Alphabet needs to maintain strong earnings growth to justify its premium valuation.\n\nOne of the Best Buying Opportunities in Months?\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Alphabet's current setup is highly attractive. The stock's RSI sits at 42, signaling that it is verging on oversold territory, a level that often precedes a rebound.\n\nThe recent decline has also started to run out of steam, with shares continuing to see gains since last week's low on Wednesday. If momentum continues to build in the coming sessions, especially with bullish analyst support and strong underlying fundamentals, Alphabet could easily mount a recovery rally back toward its February highs.\n\nFor those waiting for the right moment to get involved, this dip could be one of the better entry points investors have seen in months. If the broader tech market remains strong, it wouldn't be surprising to see Alphabet back above $200 in the near future.\n\nBefore you consider Alphabet, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

As reported by The Information, the Chinese AI startup that has startled the world of AI with its self-proclaimed cheaper and more efficient AI models is now looking for outside funding. The startup has drawn interest from names such as Alibaba and state funds, the report noted. These low-cost AI models that DeepSeek has presented recently have stirred up investor skepticism, making it quite evident that China is leaving no stone unturned to keep up in the AI arms race.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News\n\nWith fame, however, comes challenges. For DeepSeek, the surge in demand has caused outages at the small startup. Due to this reason, the company needs more AI chips and servers so that it can handle the fast-growing usage of its models, all while supporting model development. According to the report, funds that have contacted DeepSeek include China Investment Corp and the National Social Security Fund. It further noted that the startup\u2019s executives and hedge fund parent, High-Flyer Capital Management, are also discussing the potential shift to building a business that generates revenue, eventually profiting from research.\n\nThe move is in line with China\u2019s efforts to bolster the country\u2019s economy and advance its technological capabilities. This has been made evident from China\u2019s President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent meeting with private sector business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the United States. The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the United States.\u201d -Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong.\n\nIn a similar move announced before this news, OpenAI also plans to revamp its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. The move intends to ease restrictions imposed by its current non-profit parent and also increase investments.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses. The company has just introduced its AI co-scientist today, February 19th. Sharing the news on its blog, Google stated that the AI tool will act as a virtual collaborator for biomedical scientists. Tested at the Stanford University in the U.S. and Imperial College London, the tool will empower scientists to use advanced reasoning, helping them synthesize vast amounts of literature and generate novel hypotheses, the company said.\n\nThe multi-agent AI system is built on Gemini 2.0 and mirrors the reasoning process underpinning the scientific method. It will generate novel research hypotheses, a detailed research overview, and also experimental protocols. Scientists will be able to interact with these systems, helping them accelerate the clock speed of scientific and biomedical discoveries. Over time, the tool will also improve solutions generated by experts.\n\n\u201cWhile this is a preliminary finding requiring further validation, it suggests a promising avenue for capable AI systems\u2026 to augment and accelerate the work of expert scientists\u201d.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks every investor should be watching. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 19, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind Meta\u2019s Record Rally? Should We Stay Invested?\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is a well-known social media company with top apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta\u2019s shares surged this year mainly due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Now, let\u2019s determine if it\u2019s a good time to stay invested in Meta.\n\nMeta Stock Rallies 20 Sessions Straight\n\nMeta stock hasn\u2019t finished in the red in any of the trading sessions in February. Instead, the magnificent 7-stock notched 20 successive days of gains on Friday. Meta had only five losing sessions this year and has never had a losing session since Donald Trump became the 47th U.S. President.\n\nSo far this year, Meta has been the best performer among the magnificent seven stocks, up 25.8%. Meta stock soared to a record high of $736.67 on Friday, a 600% increase from its fall 2022 low when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to tame 40-year high inflation.\n\nMeta to Pour Billions into AI\n\nMeta\u2019s clear intention to make a mark in the high-growth potential AI market has bolstered investors\u2019 sentiment and relentlessly helped its stock price scale upward. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that the company intends to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure and strengthen its position amongst rivals like Microsoft Corp., its partner OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.\n\nMeta plans to invest in AI-powered humanoid robots for physical tasks, while Zuckerberg expects Llama 4 to be the most widely used advanced large language model (LLM) this year. The company\u2019s highly personalized AI assistant, Meta AI, is set to assist 1 billion users this year, and a new 2-gigawatt data center in Louisiana is in the works.\n\nMeta is one of the primary buyers of NVIDIA Corp.\u2019s chips and aims to have 1.3 million graphics processing units by the end of the year. Meta is intensifying its AI development by replacing underperforming employees and recruiting new talent to lead the AI competition.\n\nConsider Keeping Meta Stock?\n\nMeta\u2019s AI initiatives, particularly with Llama 4, hold potential for long-term growth due to its agentic capabilities in addressing complex issues for users. Secondly, the company\u2019s AI engineering agent can compete with a mid-level engineer, a ground-breaking innovation that can bolster the stock price. Finally, Meta has over 3.3 billion loyal worldwide users across its apps, surpassing rivals and offering the company a wide moat. This gives Meta a strong position for future stock outperformance.\n\nBrokers also assume that the Meta stock will jump, raising the average short-term price target to $743.55 from the last closing price of $736.67 and setting the highest target at $935, an upside of 26.9%.\n\nInvestors, thus, should continue holding Meta stock for its growth potential and consistent dividend payouts. Meta has a dividend yield of 0.27%. META\u2019s payout ratio presently sits at 8% of earnings. Check Meta Platforms\u2019 dividend history here.\n\nMeta currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "content": "Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software for mobile phones and tablet computers . In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put the company in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones. Google\u2019s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with Apple , IBM , and Microsoft . Despite its myriad of products, the original search tool remains the core of Google\u2019s success. In 2023, Alphabet took in $175 billion in revenue (57% of all Google revenue) from advertising based on users\u2019 search requests.\n\nMost search engines simply returned a list of websites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each website had. A website with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities.\n\nBrin and Page, who met as graduate students at Stanford University , were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page\u2019s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage users\u2019 own ranking abilities by tracking each website\u2019s \u201cbacking links\u201d\u2014that is, the number of other pages linked to them.\n\nIn mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing. (One of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of Sun Microsystems, Inc. ). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in Menlo Park , California, under the name Google, which was derived from a misspelling of Page\u2019s original planned name, googol (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of venture capital funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day. Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web\u2019s most popular sites, Yahoo! . By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google\u2019s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued; by the end of 2011, Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company\u2019s name became so ubiquitous that it entered the lexicon as a verb. To google became a common expression for searching the Internet.\n\nTo accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centers around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, multiprocessor personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). The heart of Google\u2019s operation, however, is built around three proprietary pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in \u201cchunks\u201d across several machines; Bigtable is the company\u2019s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201ctheater,\u201d and \u201cparticipatory\u201d).\n\nThe extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who had previously held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in computer science and melded well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt\u2019s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a \u201ctriumvirate\u201d until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to the S&P 500 Index) in 2006. By 2012, Google\u2019s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nStrategic acquisitions and monetizing Google\u2019s search engine\n\nGoogle\u2019s strong financial results reflected the rapid growth of Internet advertising in general and Google\u2019s popularity in particular. Analysts attributed part of that success to a shift in advertising spending toward the Internet and away from traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, and television. For example, American newspaper advertising fell from a peak of $64 billion in 2000 to $20.7 billion in 2011, while global online advertising grew from approximately $6 billion in 2000 to more than $72 billion in 2011.\n\nSince its founding, Google has spent large sums to secure what it has calculated to be significant Internet marketing advantages. For example, in 2003, Google spent $102 million to acquire Applied Semantics, the makers of AdSense, a service that signed up owners of websites to run various types of ads on their web pages. In 2006 Google again paid $102 million for another Web advertisement business, dMarc Broadcasting, and that same year it announced that it would pay $900 million over three and a half years for the right to sell ads on MySpace.com. In 2007 Google made its largest acquisition to date, buying online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. Two years later the company responded to the explosive growth of the mobile applications market with a $750 million deal to acquire the mobile advertising network AdMob. All of these purchases were part of Google\u2019s effort to expand from its search engine business into advertising by combining the various firms\u2019 databases of information in order to tailor ads to consumers\u2019 individual preferences.",

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The market is experiencing a period of high returns, with two consecutive years of around 25% returns and 15 years of mid-teens returns, prompting investors to be cautious. The average stock market return is around 9-10% per year, historically, based on corporate earnings growth and dividends and buybacks. The 20 companies the fund owns are well-positioned and expected to perform well. Against this backdrop, in the fourth quarter, the fund returned -0.98% compared to 2.41% return for the S&P 500.

            "content": "It could spend even more on this investor-friendly category in 2025 as its AI investments start paying off.\n\nNewly appointed CFO Anat Ashkenazi told analysts to expect a small step-up in Alphabet's (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) capital investments in 2025 during the tech giant's third-quarter earnings call. \"Likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24, but an additional increase,\" she said in late October.\n\nAlphabet ended up spending roughly $52.5 billion in 2024, up 62.5% from the $32.3 billion it spent in 2023. So I guess, by comparison, the 43% increase she forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures is merely an \"additional increase.\"\n\nAlphabet says it will spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, most of which will go toward building cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence training and inference. Prior to Alphabet's updated forecast, Wall Street analysts had expected the figure to be just $58 billion for the year, based on Ashkenazi's previous comments.\n\nWhile Alphabet is spending heavily to support artificial intelligence -- and with good reason -- it spent more than $69 billion on something else entirely in 2024, and it's one of the best reasons for investors to buy shares and hold them forever.\n\nThe massive AI budget can't be ignored\n\nAlphabet is far from the only big tech company spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. And that may be a big reason why it feels the need to spend so much.\n\n\"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call in July. That has actually already shown up in its financial results.\n\nThe Google Cloud segment's revenue growth decelerated to 30% in the fourth quarter. Many investors were disappointed with that, which is one of the reasons the stock price fell after the earnings report. But Ashkenazi was keen to point out that demand for Google Cloud is outstripping available capacity at the moment and it's working to bring more capacity online as quickly as possible. That means it needs to spend more.\n\nThe fruits of the spending should appear in short order, as Google Cloud growth should remain strong throughout 2025.\n\nImportantly, the company is starting to see returns on its AI spending within its core Google operations as well. AI Overviews, which has expanded to over 100 countries and answers more search queries every day, has helped grow overall search traffic on Google. It recently rolled out ads on AI Overviews, and management says the monetization rate is approximately the same for those ads as for traditional search ads. In other words, Google's product is successfully staving off the threat of other AI tools for information discovery without cannibalizing its ad revenue.\n\nOther AI innovations like Circle to Search and Google Lens have further bolstered high-value searches for products or shopping. So, Alphabet is starting to see meaningful returns on its massive AI spending outside of its cloud platform.\n\nEven as it spends much more than was anticipated on AI, though, investors should look at how it impacts an even more important factor for the stock.\n\nHere's Alphabet's biggest cash expense from 2024\n\nIn 2024, the one thing Alphabet spent more on than capital expenditures was capital returns to shareholders. It spent approximately $62 billion buying back shares of its own stock and another $7 billion on dividends.\n\nEven with the \"additional increase\" in capital investments planned for 2025, there's a good chance Alphabet could return even more money than that to shareholders again. That's because it's a free cash flow machine.\n\nIts 2024 free cash flow totaled $72.8 billion. And while Alphabet is planning to spend $22 billion more on data centers and the chips and networking equipment that go inside them in 2025, it could still see an improvement in free cash flow this year.\n\nAs mentioned, Google Cloud's revenue growth is poised to reaccelerate as more capacity comes online. As it scales, it has seen strong operating margin expansion, reaching 14% last year. But larger public cloud platforms have operating margins more than twice as big, indicating Alphabet could see billions more in operating income from Google Cloud in 2025.\n\nFurther AI-powered improvements in search as well as in ad-buying and creatives could help grow the core business, further offsetting the increased spending on data centers. With plenty of cash already on the balance sheet, it's likely Alphabet will once again route the vast majority of its free cash flow into its capital return program in 2025.\n\nWhy that makes Alphabet a stock to buy and hold forever\n\nThe size of Alphabet's share-repurchase program ensures that it will be able to generate strong earnings-per-share growth over the long run even if there are only modest improvements in the business. So while its increased spending on artificial intelligence could weigh on net income in 2025 and beyond as depreciation expenses start hitting the income statement, investors should still see strong improvements in earnings per share. And that extends well into the future, as Alphabet will look to invest in the next thing that could represent a step-change in its business.\n\nWith the strong free-cash-flow generation from its core operations, plus the growing profitability of its cloud computing business, Alphabet looks poised to increase its capital returns in 2025 and beyond. And that makes it an extremely shareholder-friendly stock to own.\n\nMoreover, with shares trading at less than 21 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, the stock looks like a bargain. It might be worth taking this opportunity to add shares to your portfolio and hold onto them forever.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now.\n\nProfitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage\u2014driving valuations and attracting top talent\u2014sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences.\n\nLooking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained:\n\n\u201cWhat is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We\u2019re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.\u201d\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d\u2014a group of leading tech giants\u2014delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025.\n\nTech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc.

            "content": "Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers are doubling down on their AI infrastructure spending this year.\n\nThe stock market appears to be in the middle of quite the storm as of late. In the final days of January, a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek sent shock waves around the world after it released an artificial intelligence (AI) model similar to ChatGPT -- and claims to have trained its AI with legacy architectures that aren't widely leveraged by U.S. developers.\n\nWhile technology stocks in general have been more volatile since DeepSeek's arrival, none has taken a hit as hard as Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%). Investors are panicking that Nvidia's newer chipware may not be as much of a necessity, given DeepSeek's claims.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's future prospects is disorienting, some of the company's biggest partners have been dropping clues as to how DeepSeek is influencing their own AI roadmaps. I'll analyze what these trends are and assess how they might impact Nvidia.\n\nExamining big tech's AI infrastructure plans\n\nNvidia makes its fortune primarily through its compute and networking business, which sells advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are integral for generative AI applications, and are primarily housed in large data centers.\n\nWhile DeepSeek claims to have built its AI using Nvidia's old H800 GPUs, it's been difficult to verify how accurate that is. Nevertheless, all of Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers have reported earnings for the full calendar year 2024, and there is a common thread stitching their broader AI fabric together.\n\nMicrosoft kicked things off by announcing the company will be spending $80 billion this year on data centers and other AI infrastructure projects. Meta Platforms followed up with its own aggressive spending plans -- hinting that the company could see capital expenditures (capex) up to $65 billion this year. Lastly, Alphabet and Amazon are projected to spend an estimated $180 billion combined on AI capex this year.\n\nOn the surface, big tech's rising capex plans this year should be seen as a positive thing for Nvidia. However, when Nvidia reports earnings on Feb. 26, there is one thing in particular I think investors need to be laser-focused on.\n\nWhat should investors be looking for when Nvidia reports earnings?\n\nInvestors should listen carefully to management's commentary as it relates to the spending from big tech I outlined. While Nvidia isn't going to capture all of this spend, investors should still be able to get a glimpse into how much capex the Magnificent Seven will be allocating toward Nvidia.\n\nIn my eyes, the best way to figure this out is to look at Nvidia's financial guidance. If the company's growth rates are accelerating, I'd say this is a good proxy that big tech will be spending heavily on Nvidia's newest chip architectures this year. But on the flip side, if Nvidia's guidance calls for a material deceleration in growth, it could be that its biggest customers are still buying from Nvidia, but doing so in a more protracted way.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy before Feb. 26?\n\nIt's rare that I encourage timing an investment. As long-term investors, buying stock on a specific day isn't the most important factor. Rather, it's more important to reassess your conviction in your holdings, and so long as you remain optimistic, using a strategy of dollar-cost averaging over the course of many years is generally a recipe for success.\n\nThis is a rare occasion where I think buying the dip in Nvidia prior to earnings could be a good formula.\n\nConsidering history suggests that Nvidia stock will indeed rise following its fourth-quarter earnings, combined with big tech's capex plans just for this year, and the share price recovery from the DeepSeek sell-off pictured, I'm cautiously optimistic that Nvidia stock is a lucrative opportunity right now.",

But is it really as inevitable as it seems?\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nWhile one fear tied to the rise of AI revolves around concerns it will make many jobs obsolete, Billionaire Ken Griffin is doubtful AI will soon replace human jobs, citing drawbacks in machine learning models when applied to certain situations.\n\n\u201cMachine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift,\u201d noted the Citadel founder and CEO. Illustrating his point, he added, \u201cSelf-driving cars don\u2019t work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do. Machine learning models do much better when there\u2019s consistency.\u201d\n\nGriffin is no luddite, however, his hedge fund and electronic market-making firm have been leaders in automation, and his skeptical stance does not mean he has been entirely shying away from the AI opportunity.\n\nLately, the billionaire has been fine-tuning his AI stock portfolio, shuffling his stakes in industry giants Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). He\u2019s made a big bet on one while trimming his holdings in the other.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look at these two tech colossuses and by delving into the TipRanks database, we can also find out the broader Street view on these names.\n\nNvidia\n\nTalk of AI and its impact on the stock market and the conversation will naturally turn to Nvidia. While the chip giant was far from a minnow when AI first started making its impact following the release of ChatGPT, Nvidia\u2019s positioning in the space has turned it into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.\n\nThe reason for that is pretty straightforward; the Jensen Huang-led firm simply makes the best AI chips out there and no other company has so far managed to seriously impact its dominant position. The proof is in the chip pudding: Nvidia commands more than 80% of the AI chip market.\n\nBut are cracks starting to appear in the tremendous growth story? One recent headwind has revolved around the delay of its latest GPU architecture, Blackwell, but the company might be facing a threat that seemingly came out of nowhere last month. Chinese startup DeepSeek released its latest AI model with claims it can outperform its US peers. Not only that, it also said it was developed at a fraction of the price, meaning that maybe companies didn\u2019t need to spend enormous sums of money developing their AI models.\n\nWhat followed was a slice of history with Nvidia losing the biggest chunk of market cap over a single session, shedding $590 billion of its value in one day.\n\nMaybe Griffin sensed a day of reckoning for the high-flying stock was about to play out. During 4Q24, he sold 57% (3,993,858 shares) of his NVDA holdings. It should be noted that he still holds 3,128,677 shares, currently worth more than $434 million.\n\nAccording to D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, it might be time to approach the Nvidia story with caution. Looking at the situation following DeepSeek\u2019s noisy entry, he thinks Nvidia might have to face a new reality moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are approaching peak demand, possibly as early as this year as NVDA\u2019s large customers evaluate [the] recent developments,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cThe notion that radically lower prices will led to much higher demand is almost a truism, but in previous instances took time to play out. We believe that lower inference prices will allow enterprises to roll out some new tools faster than they were otherwise planning to, but do not believe there are enough compelling applications for that to increase short-term demand by the 20-30x factor required to make up for the lower need for compute. We see the availability of ready-for-primetime scalable applications as the real gating factor and that may take 2-3 years to materialize. More importantly, as it relates to NVDA, if these new applications get deployed on device, the increased demand may not increase the TAM.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Luria rates NVDA shares as Neutral, while his $135 price target suggests the stock will remain rangebound for the time being. (To watch Luria\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThat said, most on the Street are still getting behind the AI chip leader; based on 37 Buys vs. 3 Holds, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $179.03 average price target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a ~29% premium. (See Nvidia stock forecast)\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhile Nvidia is a company that so far has benefited immensely from AI\u2019s rise, the tech has been seen as something of an issue for Alphabet \u2013 parent company of Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, DeepMind, and other subsidiaries.\n\nDespite actually being an AI pioneer, having been using the tech long before the current AI boom, the rise of GenAI is perceived as a real threat to Google\u2019s core Search business. It\u2019s a narrative that makes sense in a way. AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity are changing how people seek information. Instead of googling something and clicking on links, users can now get information without leaving the platform. This reduces Google\u2019s main bread-and butter \u2013 ad revenue, which heavily relies on search traffic. There\u2019s also direct competition from other AI-powered search engines, with Microsoft, for example, integrating AI into Bing.\n\nAlphabet, for its part, has no intention of getting left behind, and has been aggressively expanding its AI capabilities to counter the threat. It has integrated Gemini AI (formerly Bard) into Search and other products and is competing with Microsoft and AWS by offering AI-powered tools for businesses and cloud computing.\n\nThat said, the shares fell following the recent Q4 readout with Cloud growth being a particularly sore point. Google Cloud\u2019s revenue fell short of expectations, coming at $11.96 billion vs. the Street\u2019s forecast of $12.19 billion. Additionally, the company forecasted $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, far above the consensus estimate of $58.8 billion.\n\nGriffin, however, must think all these worries are overblown. During Q4 he significantly increased his GOOGL holdings by 135% with the purchase of 786,737 shares. His total stake now stands at 1,372,475 shares, worth more than $254 million at the current share price.\n\nMirroring Griffin\u2019s move, RBC\u2019s Brad Erickson, an analyst ranked in the top 2% of Street stock experts, strikes a confident tone regarding the search giant\u2019s prospects. Following the Q4 results, he wrote, \u201cThe company\u2019s AI rollout is accelerating with Search demonstrating improvements as opposed to disruption (consistent with our checks coming in), capacity constraints which likely explain the Cloud miss should ease, Google I/O sets up for a bevy of new AI product announcements and management just lowered the bar on margins given Capex & headcount commentary. No doubt the impact of AI for GOOGL will continue to be hotly debated but intellectual consistency across the space would suggest GOOGL\u2019s playing offense on AI & we\u2019d agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d expect a number of substantive announcements at I/O in early May, however, given the clear breakneck pace of model rollouts in fueling the various products (7 products or platforms now with over 2B users which leverage Gemini), we see the narrative around GOOGL\u2019s overall AI positioning as improving over the medium term versus getting worse,\u201d the 5-star analyst further said.\n\nConveying his confidence, Erickson rates GOOGL shares as Outperform (i.e., Buy) while his $235 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 27%. (To watch Erickson\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n26 other analysts join Erickson in the bull camp and with the addition of 10 Holds, the consensus view is that this stock is a Moderate Buy. The average target stands at $215.85, suggesting the shares will climb 16.5% higher in the months ahead.

The owner of top search engine Google also has an established track record of earnings growth, making it a company investors know they can count on over time.\n\nSo you might expect to pay a lot to get in on Alphabet shares today. But this tech powerhouse, after a pullback in the shares in recent days, right now is trading at its lowest level in months. Why the decline? Investors were disappointed when Alphabet's quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates -- and capital spending plans exceeded estimates.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nNow, let's consider whether we, too, should worry about the company's latest announcements -- or if this tech giant is a no-brainer bargain buy.\n\nAn investor studies something on a laptop and takes notes.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLet's \"Google it\"\n\nFirst, a bit of background on Alphabet. You probably know the company best for something most of us use every day: Google Search. It's such a popular search engine, holding about 90% of the global market, that it's even part of our vocabulary today. If we don't know the answer to a question, we'll \"Google it.\"\n\nAnd this has become Alphabet's key to revenue. Advertisers pay to advertise their products and services to us as we use the Google platform -- generating billions of dollars in earnings for Alphabet.\n\nOn top of this, Alphabet also has a cloud business, sells devices, and operates an autonomous vehicle unit called Waymo.\n\nAdvertising across Alphabet's platforms, and sales of products and services through the cloud business, have helped the company's earnings to advance over time. Return on invested capital also has increased, showing Alphabet has benefited from its investments.\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nNow, let's turn to the recent quarter. Though fourth-quarter earnings per share, at $2.15, slightly exceeded estimates, Alphabet's revenue of $96.47 billion fell short of the $96.56 billion expected by analysts. Meanwhile, the company said capital expenditures would reach $75 billion this year, well beyond the less than $59 billion analysts had predicted.\n\nGrowth of Google Services and Cloud\n\nThose two elements disappointed investors, but it's important to consider the full picture. If we look at Alphabet's revenue breakdown, Google Services and Google Cloud each reported double-digit revenue gains -- only the smaller businesses that fall into the \"other bets\" category saw a drop in revenue. So, Alphabet's key revenue drivers continue to offer a significant amount of growth.\n\nIt's also important to consider the progress of Google Cloud in recent times. In the quarter, revenue climbed to more than $11 billion, and operating income reached beyond $2 billion. Google Cloud offers a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered products and services, and these are driving growth -- last year, the number of first-time commitments doubled from the previous year, and the number of deals surpassing $250 million doubled too. This highlights the importance of Alphabet's investment in AI infrastructure, to set the stage for this growth to continue.\n\nAs for search, Alphabet's investments in AI are driving improvements in the search engine, offering users more variety and precision when it comes to answers -- and Alphabet says new offerings like AI Overviews are resulting in more use and greater satisfaction.\n\nOf course, keep in mind that Alphabet faces one particular headwind at the moment. A U.S. court ruled against the company in an antitrust case last year, and the Justice Department aims to force Alphabet to sell the Chrome browser. It's clear Alphabet will fight any such request, and I think the government -- as in previous occasions, such as the 1998 case against Microsoft -- will have difficulty completely upsetting the status quo. So, while the case is a risk, I wouldn't let it stop me from buying Alphabet stock.\n\nNow, let's consider valuation. Following the recent share price decline, Alphabet now is trading at 20x forward earnings estimates, down from more than 24x just a few weeks ago. Considering Alphabet's solid earnings track record, its market leadership, and growth in both of its main businesses, this level looks dirt cheap -- and that makes Alphabet a no-brainer bargain stock to buy right now on the dip.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other streaming service stocks.\n\nThe live streaming market size is expected to increase by US$20.64 billion, reflecting a CAGR of ~16.6% over 2024 and 2029, as per Technavio. The significant use of smartphones and constant internet connectivity allows users to easily stream content, resulting in market expansion. Furthermore, technological advancements such as AI and VR continue to enhance user experiences, further bolstering the market\u2019s momentum.\n\nPivoting to Next-generation Streaming 2.0\n\nAfter 4 years of experimentation among the legacy global diversified media companies, S&P Global believes that 2025 can be an inflection point in the broader industry\u2019s multi-year transition to streaming from linear TV. The scaling of advertising on streaming is expected to be a critical component for growth in profitability. Most of the streaming services don\u2019t have enough subscribers on ad-tiers to attract advertising dollars, mainly those advertising budgets that are departing linear TV, says the firm.\n\nMainly for 2025, the firm expects companies to announce international JVs and domestic bundling arrangements. Why? These strategies can help the scaling up of streaming services, manage operating expenses through sharing infrastructure costs (mainly in second-tier international markets), and reduce churn.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nFocusing on Quality and Not Quantity\n\nAs per BDO, media companies and those organizations providing streaming services have increased their content libraries in a bid to attract new customers. Over the past few years, several media companies and streaming providers focused on customer attraction, targeting to get as many new subscribers as possible. The streaming platforms continued to churn out new material, resulting in a content boom. Now, the companies are focused on prioritizing customer retention as they reassess the quality of their content to ensure that it addresses demand.\n\nBDO expects that most major streaming platforms are expected to increase their spending on content by less than 10% over the upcoming few years. The broader streaming industry continues to invest in podcasts. However, since the podcast space remains crowded, differentiating new products is expected to remain critical in 2025 to fuel demand.\n\nAs the broader sector evolves, media companies and streaming platforms need to revamp their strategies to reap the benefits of opportunities and address challenges, like subscribers sharing credentials and customer retention. BDO opines that these companies are required to look for ways to improve revenues, either by increasing the service fees or adding ad-free tiers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Streaming Service Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we sifted through several online rankings and chose companies catering to the broader streaming services sector. Next, we chose the ones that analysts view as Strong Buy stocks and see upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 14. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 19%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) caters to the streaming service business mainly through YouTube, which happens to be one of the leading video streaming platforms globally. In Q3 2024, YouTube ads revenues rose $969 million and $3.4 billion from the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2023, to the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This growth was aided by the brand advertising products followed by direct response advertising products, both of which were aided by higher spending by the advertisers.\n\nYouTube remains a key component of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s ecosystem, with the platform expected to benefit further from potential AI video generation models. Furthermore, the platform remains well-placed to capture linear TV advertising dollars transitioning to Connected TV (CTV). The models are anticipated to fuel further engagement and monetization opportunities. Therefore, YouTube\u2019s dominance in video streaming, YouTube Premium subscription revenues, and YouTube TV\u2019s live offerings are expected to benefit Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nGlobal video ad spending continues to increase and advertisers are shifting budgets from traditional TV to digital platforms. YouTube, as a result of its strong presence, remains well-placed to capitalize on this growth opportunity. Furthermore, YouTube Shorts has been attracting new advertisers. Qualivian Investment Partners, an investment partnership focused on long-only public equities, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet\u2019s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Management continued to highlight developments with their generative AI program, which is seen as a foundational platform with opportunities across their businesses but particularly in search and cloud. However, this comes with material capex investment well ahead of the expected economic benefits from Gen AI, and the level of spending is leading investors to worry about the ROI on that spend for Alphabet, as well as the other hyperscalers (Microsoft and Amazon). We continue to have confidence in Alphabet\u2019s ability to generate strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth well above the S&P 500\u2019s in the years to come and view it as a core holding for the long term.\u201d\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best streaming service stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Investors and tech enthusiasts alike should watch closely\u2014Alphabet\u2019s next move could be a monumental one.\n\nThis Google Parent Stock Could Explode Thanks to AI and Green Innovations\n\nHow Does Alphabet\u2019s AI Leadership Impact Its Market Potential?\n\nAlphabet Inc., known for spearheading AI advancements, possesses an unparalleled edge in market potential due to its significant investments and breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Alphabet\u2019s AI capabilities manifest across multiple platforms\u2014such as Google Search, YouTube recommendations, and autonomous driving through its subsidiary, Waymo. This leadership positions Alphabet at a pivotal point for dominating future tech sectors. Analysts argue that should Alphabet harness AI technologies to achieve significant breakthroughs, there could be monumental uplifts in its share value, significantly impacting market forecasts and investment strategies.\n\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Alphabet\u2019s Sustainability Initiatives?\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Environmental Impact: Alphabet\u2019s focus on renewable energy and carbon neutrality supports global environmental goals, improving its brand image and consumer appeal.\n\n\u2013 Cost Efficiency: Long-term investments in sustainable energy can lead to reduced operational costs.\n\n\u2013 Regulatory Alignment: Proactive sustainability measures help Alphabet align with stricter regulations and environmental policies worldwide.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Initial Investment Costs: Upfront expenses for green technologies and infrastructures can be substantial.\n\n\u2013 Uncertain ROI: The return on investment for significant sustainability initiatives remains uncertain, with potential impacts only visible in the long run.\n\n\u2013 Potential Technological Hurdles: Adopting new green technologies can come with unforeseen challenges and implementation delays.\n\nHow Do Alphabet\u2019s Ventures into Quantum Computing and Health Tech Influence Its Share?\n\nAlphabet\u2019s foray into quantum computing and health technology represents an ambitious drive to capture additional high-growth markets. Initiatives like Google\u2019s Quantum AI Lab aim to push the boundaries of processing power and problem-solving capabilities in complex computing scenarios. Similarly, Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries exploring health tech innovations, such as Verily, seek to revolutionise medical diagnostics and biotechnology.\n\nThese ventures could significantly boost Alphabet\u2019s share in the following ways:\n\n\u2013 Innovation Leadership: Dominance in quantum computing could establish Alphabet as a leader in next-generation computing, attracting tech-focused investors.\n\n\u2013 Healthcare Market Growth: Successful health tech innovations can open entirely new revenue streams and fortify Alphabet\u2019s position in a sector poised for expansive growth.\n\nDespite these potentials, investors must recognise that both quantum computing and health tech remain nascent fields; substantial commercialisation and regulatory breakthroughs are still needed to ensure tangible returns.\n\nFor more on Alphabet\u2019s continued strides in technology and innovation, check out the parent company\u2019s insights at Alphabet.",

            "content": "Capital spending by technology giants remains top of mind for investors following earnings reports from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (META), Meta Platforms (META) and others. Google stock has retreated about 10% since the company's fourth quarter earnings report on Feb. 4.\n\nThe impact of generative artificial intelligence on the internet search advertising business of Google stock also remains the key issue for investors. Also, antitrust lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice have pressured Google stock. Both Google's internet search and advertising businesses are under DoJ scrutiny.\n\nTrump Picks Top Antitrust Official\n\nFurther, President Donald Trump has nominated Gail Slater for the top antitrust post at the Justice Department. Wall Street analysts haven't had much to say on Slater's appointment. Slater will report to Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nAs assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, Slater would oversee ongoing cases versus Google, Apple (AAPL) and other the companies.\n\nOne view had been that a Trump DoJ may be more open to a settlement than the Biden administration or seek lighter penalties.\n\nIn a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing, Slater said that \"resources\" will be a factor in pursuing the cases.\n\nSlater most recently was a policy adviser for Vice President JD Vance. Earlier, she worked at Fox (FOXA) and Roku (ROKU). Her government career includes 10 years at the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nMeanwhile, Google stock fell on its Q4 earnings report amid higher-than-expected 2025 capital spending.\n\n\"Advertising revenues were ahead of expectations, but Google Cloud was soft, operating income was in line and 2025 capex was well above Wall Street estimates,\" said Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee in a report.\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon and Meta as well as Microsoft (MSFT) plan to continue high capital spending amid fierce competition in artificial intelligence. The emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek has roiled artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nGoogle Stock: Winning Back Investors\n\nOverall, Google stock has retreated about 2% in 2025. Shares trade below the 50-day moving average of Alphabet stock.\n\nChief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi will take part in a Morgan Stanley conference on March 4.\n\nAmid U.S.-China trade friction, China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the nation's antitrust agency, announced it had opened an antitrust investigation into Google. The probe will reportedly focus on possible harm done against Chinese OEMs that use Google's Android operating system.\n\nAlso, Google stock has dropped off the IBD Leaderboard. Also, Alphabet's technical ratings have weakened and it continues to under-perform some Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nAI Search Competition Growing\n\nGenerative AI startup OpenAI's ChatGPT has been slowly gaining search market share. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries while Google's business model has been based on providing web links. Also, startup Perplexity is another new rival.\n\nGoogle is competing with OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta and many others in building new foundation models. In December, Google unveiled its new artificial intelligence model, Gemini 2.0.\n\nGoogle began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. In late October, Google launched AI Overviews in 100 countries\n\nThe AI Overviews system uses Google's in-house Gemini AI model. Advertisers utilizing Gemini AI tools see increased traffic and click-through rates, especially among younger demographics, Google says.\n\nIn December, Google announced the Willow quantum computing chip. Google has been a leader in quantum research. But quantum technology faces challenges.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Waymo Expands\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo on Dec. 5 announced that the company plans to expand its autonomous vehicle rideshare service to Miami in 2026. The Waymo One robotaxi service currently operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with upcoming service already planned for Austin, Tex. and Atlanta. In Miami, Waymo will compete with Uber Technologies (UBER) and other rideshare services. In Austin and Atlanta, Waymo is partnering with Uber.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo also disclosed that it has reached 150,000 trips per week, rapid growth from August levels at 100,00 per week. Waymo is widely viewed as the leader in autonomous vehicles. In October, Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round, including Google and previous investors. If Wall Street analysts start including Waymo in Alphabet's valuation, it would be a big development.\n\nGoogle Stock: YouTube, TikTok\n\nAlso, analysts say GOOGL stock is getting a boost from the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory.\n\nAside from Google's core internet search advertising business, Wall Street analysts view growth at YouTube and cloud computing as key. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business, where it's battling Apple in smartphones.\n\nGoogle aims to slow down the growth of TikTok with its own short video platform. How much money Google generates from YouTube Shorts is a key issue for 2024, analysts say. YouTube Shorts now generates roughly 70 billion daily views.\n\nIn cloud computing, Google is still the third biggest service provider, behind Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft. Like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft' Azure business, Google's cloud unit has upped capital spending targeting the new opportunity in generative AI.\n\nGoogle's 2022 acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion seems to be paying dividends. Mandiant is part of Google's cloud-based cybersecurity services.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Is It A Buy Or Sell Now?\n\nGOOGL stock popped 37% in 2024, though it pulled back from a high of 201.42 set on Dec. 17.\n\nWhether the internet giant is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Rating of Alphabet stock currently stands at 77 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.\n\nGoogle stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D-plus. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.\n\nFurther, Alphabet stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nOn MarketSurge, GOOGL stock has retreated back into a buy zone. But investors should be cautious. And, long-time holders could take profits.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk has recently been in the news for his vain attempt to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, but that\u2019s not all. It has recently come to light that Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is canvassing potential investors for a roughly $10 billion funding round. This could value the company at an estimated $75 billion.\n\nAccording to media reports, existing investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Valor Equity Partners, are in discussions to participate in the transaction. However, the terms of the round aren\u2019t finalized yet and may change.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nAccording to data compiled by PitchBook, xAI was last valued at $51 billion. The startup was launched by Musk in 2023, a rival to OpenAI. xAI has recently revealed that Grok3, its AI chatbot, is in the final stages of development and will be released in a week or two.\n\n\u201cGrok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we\u2019ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that\u2019s been released, that we\u2019re aware of, so that\u2019s a good sign\u201d.\n\nWith the competition in the AI world heating up fast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has recently revealed its plans around GPT-5, and how the company is going to work on simplifying its offerings. He stated that he realizes how the company\u2019s models and product offerings are getting complicated, bringing a solution for user ease.\n\n\u201cWe hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence\u201d.\n\nCurrently, users are required to manually select various AI models for different tasks. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, internally known as Orion, will be the company\u2019s final \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d After its release, the company will unify o-series and GPT-series models.\n\nIt will do so by offering a system that can use all of its features and determine when to take more or less time to think. The GPT-5 model will be launched as a comprehensive AI system that will incorporate o3 along with other technologies.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues",

They generally are the children of the millennials, and they bring a different set of formative experiences.\n\nIf the millennials were shaped by the terrorist attacks and aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, and Gen Z was shaped by the Great Recession of 2007-09, Generation Alpha clearly was shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cGen Alpha will be the most diverse generation in history, and this reality is shaping kids\u2019 expectations,\u201d according to audience targeting firm GWI.\n\n\u201cIf the success of Disney\u2019s \u2018Encanto\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough, our data shows that fair representation is already on their minds. Helping people and everyone being treated the same are top of teens\u2019 priority list, and a third already pay attention to diversity in media. The same is true of sustainability. Gen Alphas are maturing in a time of climate emergency, and their attitudes echo this.\u201d\n\nAnd now, get ready for Generation Beta. The first members will be born this year. They, of course, will always know the pandemic as history. Some of them will live into the 22nd century.\n\nFor them, the digital and physical worlds will be seamless, according to demographer and futurist Mark McCrindle in a blog post.\n\n\u201cWhile Generation Alpha has experienced the rise of smart technology and artificial intelligence, Generation Beta will live in an era where AI and automation are fully embedded in everyday life \u2014 from education and workplaces to health care and entertainment.\u201d\n\nThis will be the first generation to experience autonomous transportation at scale, immersive virtual environments and intense personalization, driven by AI algorithms that \u201cwill tailor their learning, shopping and social interactions in ways we can only begin to imagine today,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAt the same time, they also \u201cwill inherit a world grappling with major societal challenges,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith climate change, global population shifts and rapid urbanization at the forefront, sustainability will not just be a preference but an expectation.\u201d\n\nThe world of generations Alpha and Beta is going to be complex in ways we can only start to conceptualize today. The majority of jobs they will hold likely do not exist right now. But what we do know about those jobs is that they will require more critical thinking, sophisticated analysis and innovation. Emotional intelligence will need to reflect a greater social consciousness and an ability to communicate in ways I don\u2019t think I am capable of even articulating trying to project that far into the future.\n\nAnd, candidly, I am worried that we, today, are not adequately preparing them for it.\n\nI hung onto a report recently from The Dakota Scout that detailed results of the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, often referred to as the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\n\nAverage scores are reported on a NAEP scale that ranges from 0 to 500, based on student performance on state tests, it said.\n\nIn 2024, the average score of fourth grade students in South Dakota on math assessments was 240, compared with the national average of 237. The average score of eighth grade students in South Dakota was 260, higher than the national average of 257.",

Investors are bearish on the tech giant after it missed expectations for revenue. While the miss on the top line isn't great news, and it may weigh on the stock in the short term, another number could end up being more concerning for Alphabet investors this year: The amount it has planned for capital expenditures.\n\nAlphabet is planning to spend heavily on artificial intelligence\n\nOn Feb. 4, Alphabet reported its latest earnings numbers, for the last three months of 2024. Sales totaled $96.47 billion and rose 12% year over year. More importantly, however, those numbers came in lower than the $96.56 billion analysts were expecting for the period. And when expectations are high for a company like Alphabet, any miss can lead to a drop in the share price.\n\nThe bigger issue that may also worry investors is that the company is planning to spend $75 billion on its capital expenditures in 2025. That's a significant 43% increase compared with the $52.5 billion that it spent in 2024. The company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) as it looks to enhance its offerings with next-gen technologies.\n\nThis, however, comes at a time when many investors are growing concerned about how aggressively tech companies are spending on AI. Last month, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI model which it said cost a fraction of what it took to create ChatGPT and yet performed similarly to the popular chatbot.\n\nWhy spending heavily on AI could backfire\n\nTech companies have been spending aggressively on AI as they look to keep up with their rivals. But the danger is that all that spending may not yield better results, at least not for a while. Last year, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned that 2025 could be a slow year for the development of AI, saying that the \"low-hanging fruit is gone\" and that \"the hill is steeper.\"\n\nAmid more challenging economic conditions, companies may also significantly scale back their AI-related projects and expenditures. Research company Gartner projects that by the end of this year, as many as 30% of generative AI projects may become abandoned, as businesses may give up due to rising costs or not seeing a clear payoff from their investments.\n\nSpending heavily on capital expenditures and bringing on more staff may result in cost reductions and layoffs later on, as has sometimes been the trend in tech when it comes to overspending. While there are opportunities in AI, it can be easy for companies to get ahead of themselves and spend too feverishly.\n\nAlphabet still looks like a good long-term buy\n\nThere is a risk that Alphabet could end up overspending on AI, but I believe the net benefit will be a positive one for investors. Even if its AI spending doesn't result in game-changing products and services right away, there's a lot of potential for Alphabet in bolstering and enhancing assets like Google Search and YouTube with the help of AI.\n\nAlphabet's stock currently trades at a relatively modest 23 times its trailing earnings. That's cheap compared to the average stock in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which trades at 39 times its profits.\n\nThere might be some adversity ahead for Alphabet. But as long as you are comfortable with some short-term risk, the tech stock can still be an excellent investment to hold on to, especially over the long run.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Intel Corp. INTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nNVIDIA or Palantir: Which Is the Better AI Stock to Buy Now?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) propelled NVIDIA Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. to the top spots on Wall Street. NVIDIA led the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, while Palantir topped the S&P 500.\n\nWith the AI market in early expansion phases, a lot more growth potential lies ahead for both stocks. This justifies considering both stocks for investment. However, which is the superior AI choice right now? Let\u2019s see \u2013\n\nThe Bullish Case for NVDA Stock\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s shares recently took a beating when a Chinese company launched a low-cost AI chatbot, DeepSeek. Despite the sell-off, chip demand for NVIDIA should improve due to DeepSeek\u2019s affordable model driving up AI usage. Anyhow, the strong demand for the high-end new Blackwell architecture would increase NVIDIA\u2019s revenues and boost the stock price.\n\nThe likes of Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are choosing Blackwell chips for their improved energy efficiency and faster AI interface. Having said that, the demand for NVIDIA\u2019s old Hopper chips also remains steady due to their superior quality in comparison to rival Intel Corp.\n\nDespite DeepSeek\u2019s potential to disrupt AI infrastructure spending with its low-cost model, major companies like Microsoft continue to invest substantially in NVIDIA\u2019s products, projecting massive outlays of over $300 billion on AI infrastructure and highlighting the semiconductor behemoth\u2019s strong growth potential.\n\nAnother reason in favor of NVIDIA\u2019s growth is its strong presence in the graphic processing units (GPU) market, which provides the company with a competitive edge. The GPU market is projected to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $101.54 billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research (read more: Buy NVIDIA Stock, DeepSeek's Threat is Exaggerated).\n\nThe Bullish Case for PLTR Stock\n\nIn the growing generative AI market, Palantir\u2019s leadership in AI-powered process mining indicates strong growth potential. Palantir aims to boost growth by integrating ground-breaking AI with machine learning functionalities. An increase in fourth-quarter revenues from both U.S. commercial and government clients points to strong growth likelihoods.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The quantum computing industry is at a critical inflection point as it transitions from research labs to commercial applications. While a definitive quantum advantage -- where quantum computers decisively outperform classical systems -- has yet to be achieved, the race to reach this milestone is driving significant investment opportunities. According to The Quantum Insider, quantum computing could generate $1 trillion in economic value by 2035, transforming industries such as finance, defense, life sciences, and manufacturing.\n\nAt the forefront of this revolution are IonQ (IONQ -5.96%) and Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%), two companies pursuing distinct technological approaches to quantum computing. As this cutting-edge technology reshapes fields ranging from drug discovery to financial modeling, understanding their unique strategies and market positioning is essential for investors looking to capitalize on its potential.\n\nBelow, I'll explore each company's quantum platform to assess which stock offers the best exposure to this transformative innovation.\n\nThe case for IonQ\n\nIonQ's competitive position in quantum computing rests on three key advantages. First, the company's trapped-ion technology is experiencing strong commercial traction, particularly in government and defense.\n\nThe company's business momentum is reflected in two recent U.S. Air Force Research Lab contracts -- a $54.5 million quantum computing agreement and a new $21.1 million quantum networking project via Qubitekk. These contracts, coupled with a new strategic partnership with General Dynamics, demonstrate growing confidence in IonQ's quantum solutions.\n\nThe company's cloud-based quantum computing services represent another key advantage. IonQ makes its quantum computers accessible through major platforms including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, creating multiple revenue streams while expanding market reach. This quantum-computing-as-a-service (QCaaS) model allows customers to experiment with quantum applications without significant upfront investment.\n\nHowever, IonQ remains deeply unprofitable as it prioritizes technological advancement over near-term earnings. Last November, the company reported a net loss of $129.6 million in the first nine months of 2024, with an accumulated deficit of $481.7 million. While concerning, these losses reflect heavy investments in achieving higher qubit counts and fidelity-critical milestones for reaching broad quantum advantage.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's quantum computing ambitions demonstrate the power of deep technical expertise and resources. The company's latest Willow quantum processor shows remarkable progress, achieving error correction that scales with more qubits -- a crucial milestone known in the industry as \"below threshold.\" This breakthrough suggests Alphabet is making significant strides toward practical quantum computing.\n\nThe technical achievements are striking. Willow completed computations in under five minutes that would take today's fastest supercomputers billions of years to solve. While this benchmark doesn't yet have commercial applications, it validates Alphabet's approach to quantum architecture and error correction. Moreover, Alphabet's state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Santa Barbara gives it end-to-end control over the complex manufacturing process.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's quantum computing efforts represent just one initiative within its vast technology portfolio. The company's recent earnings show strong artificial intelligence (AI) monetization and cloud growth, driving a rather healthy operating margin of 32% in the most recent quarter. While quantum computing could enhance these businesses over the long term, particularly in AI applications, it remains a research-focused investment, rather than a near-term revenue driver.\n\nWhich stock is the better quantum computing play?\n\nFor investors seeking pure quantum computing exposure, IonQ presents a clearer opportunity, despite its current unprofitability. The company's growing government contracts and strategic partnerships demonstrate commercial validation of its trapped-ion technology, while its cloud-based service model creates multiple paths to revenue growth as the quantum computing market develops.\n\nAlphabet offers a more balanced investment proposition. While its quantum computing breakthroughs are impressive, particularly in error correction, they represent just one component of a diverse technology portfolio.\n\nThe tech stock gives investors quantum computing exposure alongside established revenue streams from advertising, cloud services, and artificial intelligence development. However, for investors specifically seeking quantum computing exposure, pure-play alternatives may offer more focused opportunities.",

Marc Toberoff, Musk\u2019s attorney, confirmed that he submitted the bid for all OpenAI\u2019s assets to its board.\n\nThe offer is a twist to Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s rift that began last August when Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI. The lawsuit accused the company of putting profits before its initial nonprofit mission which aimed to advance AI in a way that benefits humanity.\n\nThe two prominent figures of the tech world are still involved in a legal battle over the future of this AI startup.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI News Making Waves on Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nAnalysts have been skeptical of Musk\u2019s move ever since it came to light.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to be pretty suspicious of this considering that he has a competitor himself\u2026 which is structured as a for-profit company, so I think there\u2019s more than meets the eye here\u201d.\n\nSam Altman has this to say about the bid:\n\nMusk was \u201ca competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna buy this\u2019 with total disregard for the mission\u201d.\n\nPlus, this is what Altman wrote on X as a reply to Musk\u2019s bid:\n\n\u201cNo thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was cofounded by Musk and Altman in 2018 as a non-profit, with Musk leaving before the company took off. Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says that the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity. However, it was now focused on making money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Altman said that he has no interest in the offer, stating that OpenAI is not for sale.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

B Capital and Capital Factory were also in on the leading edge, reports noted. Apptronik had previously landed $28 million in an earlier funding round, so the huge new surge of cash is likely to represent big things ahead.\n\nThe new development means Google will likely have a piece of the household robot market of the future, as Apptronik is looking to get robots to work beyond the factory floor.

Yes, the negative comments about Google\u2019s change have been deleted, Google admitted, and Google also actively shut down the ability to \u201csuggest edits or report inaccuracies\u201d about the newly-minted Gulf of America.\n\nBut given that the change has already been filed with the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), and Google Maps draws much of its naming data from the GNIS, the issue is now moot, and the Gulf of America is indeed the Gulf of America. Thus, \u201creporting inaccuracies\u201d in such a case is, basically, treated like spam, as the name is no longer an inaccuracy.\n\nIs Alphabet a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 27 Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 26.39% rally in its share price over the past year, the average GOOGL price target of $215.85 per share implies 17.39% upside potential.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google's subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products such as Chromecast). Google's cloud computing platform, or GCP, accounts for roughly 10% of Alphabet's revenue with the firm's investments in up-and-coming technologies such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber) making up the rest.\n\nFollowing our analysis of the options activities associated with Alphabet, we pivot to a closer look at the company's own performance.\n\nAlphabet's Current Market Status\n\nWith a volume of 8,039,814, the price of GOOGL is up 0.15% at $183.89.\n\nRSI indicators hint that the underlying stock is currently neutral between overbought and oversold.\n\nNext earnings are expected to be released in 70 days.\n\nTurn $1000 into $1270 in just 20 days?\n\n20-year pro options trader reveals his one-line chart technique that shows when to buy and sell.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn an update on the bid by an Elon Musk-led consortium to buy the non-profit that controls OpenAI, Musk\u2019s lawyers have reportedly stated in a court filing that they will withdraw the $97.4 billion bid if the AI startup drops its plans to become a for-profit entity.\n\nMusk is trying hard to keep OpenAI from becoming a for-profit entity, even filing a case against Altman in August. Musk co-founded the artificial intelligence startup with Sam Altman but left the company in 2018 after a disagreement with Altman and other cofounders over OpenAI\u2019s direction and funding.\n\nThe filing noted that Musk will withdraw the bid if the OpenAI board is \u201cprepared to preserve the charity\u2019s mission and stipulate to take the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign off its assets by halting its conversion. \u201c\n\nOtherwise, \u201cthe charity must be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets.\u201d -The filing in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, said, as reported by Reuters.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and 10 AI News Stories That Are Dominating Headlines\n\nIn its filing with the same court on Wednesday, OpenAI said that Musk\u2019s bid to buy OpenAI contradicts the arguments he is making in court that the startup\u2019s assets cannot be transferred for private gain. It seems to be \u201can improper bid to undermine a competitor.\u201d Even though Musk seemingly wants OpenAI to retain its non-profit structure, OpenAI noted that in his bid, he wants OpenAI to be sold to himself.\n\n\u201cIn this Court, Musk argues that OpenAI, Inc.\u2019s assets cannot be \u2018transferred away\u2019 for \u2018private gain. But out of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers. Musk would have OpenAI, Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors.\u201d -OpenAI said in a legal filing.\n\nIt is to be noted here that OpenAI is under no obligation to consider the bid.\n\n\u201cThe independent Board\u2019s sole fiduciary duty is to the mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity. Respectfully, it is not up to a competitor to decide what is in the best interests of OpenAI\u2019s mission.\u201d -Andrew Nussbaum, counsel to the OpenAI Board at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses. On February 13, Mizuho Securities reiterated an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and reduced the price target from $235 to $230. The analyst\u2019s buy rating stems from several factors. First, the company\u2019s advertising revenues have exceeded expectations. Robust growth in insurance, retail, and political advertising has led to strong performances in both Search and YouTube.\n\nAdvertising strength has boosted overall revenue for the company, exceeding market consensus. Moreover, the company\u2019s demand for Core GCP products and AI infrastructure remains high, despite capacity constraints leading to Cloud revenue growth below expectations. This implies that potential revenue may grow for the company as capacity issues are resolved. The company\u2019s strategic capex investments in AI and custom ASICs further echo management\u2019s confidence in long-term growth.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that are trending on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

December\u2019s monthly job gains also showed an upward revision, highlighting that the US labor market ended 2024 in a better position than previously reported. Economists are thus of the opinion that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in the near future. Consequently, this increases pressure on inflation data to cool down before the central bank considers slashing borrowing costs.\n\nOn January 30, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d to discuss the stock market and the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged. Sticking to the opinion he gave in December, Gundlach was of the view that 2025 would bring a maximum of two rate cuts by the Fed. He reiterated that he was not predicting two cuts but that two would be the maximum number attained in 2025, keeping one rate cut as the base case for the year. The unemployment rate went up for several consecutive months before ticking down, which Gundlach thinks is a matter of deep solace for the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Outlook for the Stock Market Look Like?\n\nOn February 10, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth\u2019s chief investment strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss the 2025 outlook for the stock market. She showed bullish sentiment towards the market, particularly due to strong earnings growth. Comparing the current environment to previous periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and the 1990s, Bartels highlighted the role of robotics, AI, and Web3 in driving long-term growth in the present.\n\nShe noted that companies today fund investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage, unlike the 1990s. Her estimates showed that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the decade\u2019s end, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 growth stocks.

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) is one of the most dominant companies in the world. It practically owns the search engine market with Google. Billions of people use Google to find what they need on the internet, and the advertising it serves to them along the way has made it one of the most lucrative brands in the world.\n\nHowever, like any other company, Alphabet is subject to ups and downs. After it reported its fourth-quarter earnings, the stock dropped by around 7%. Clearly, the market didn't like what it heard, but I saw this blip as a buying opportunity. The reasons why I bought the stock had nothing to do with its latest results -- I'm more concerned about its long-term trajectory.\n\nAlphabet has other businesses besides its dominant search engine\n\nAlphabet may be Google's parent company, but it also owns other massive brands such as YouTube, Android, and Waymo. These are strong businesses with huge potential.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, YouTube is the most-watched streaming service in the U.S. That's unlikely to change anytime soon, as YouTube has millions of content creators catering to specific audiences. Furthermore, these videos are relatively short compared to traditional TV shows, and short-form content is popular among younger audiences. YouTube ads had another strong quarter, lifting its revenue 14% year over year to $10.5 billion. For reference, streaming giant Netflix had revenue of $10.3 billion in Q4.\n\nAnother exciting segment of the business is Waymo, its autonomous vehicle division. Waymo now has self-driving taxis carrying customers in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and plans to bring them to Austin, Atlanta, and Miami later this year. They will also debut in Tokyo, marking Waymo's first international expansion. That's a significant move, but any revenue this division books is being outweighed by the costs of getting these services up and running. Still, these are long-term investments that could position Alphabet to take a dominant share in a growing and important market.\n\nIn my opinion, Google Cloud is the company's most exciting non-search business. Alphabet's cloud computing division is helping power AI workloads across the globe. It grew its revenue by 30% year over year to $12 billion, making it one of Alphabet's fastest-growing divisions. It also provides 12% of total revenue.\n\nNone of these divisions have anything to do with Alphabet's legacy Google search business, which is a key factor in assessing if Alphabet has any succeeding long-term growth investments. There are still other divisions where Alphabet is growing and developing, making this a no-brainer purchase over the long term. However, Alphabet's stock is incredibly cheap compared to its big tech peers, and that's why any dip in the stock price should be seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe stock is cheap for its long-term growth trajectory\n\nAfter Alphabet's tumble following earnings, it now trades at 24 times trailing earnings and 21.4 times forward earnings.\n\nIf that sounds relatively cheap in today's market, that's because it is. The S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) recently traded for 25.5 times trailing earnings and 22.3 times forward earnings. An even better comparison is the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, which features a higher concentration of Alphabet's big tech peers. That index traded for 33.4 times trailing earnings and 27.2 times forward earnings.\n\nSo Alphabet's stock doesn't carry a premium to either index, and investors value the company at a level below the market average. However, it's clearly an above-average business. While short-term guidance and projections may cause the market to sell off the stock in the short term, the long-term trajectory for Alphabet is still positive, and it's why I'm a buyer of the stock at today's prices.\n\nAlphabet is succeeding in too many long-term markets (AI, autonomous driving, social media, and cloud computing, to name a few) to ignore. Those successes will lead to long-term market-crushing returns for the stock.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 17 Best Stocks for Kids According to Jim Cramer. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best stocks for kids according to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, made a compelling argument on Monday that parents should begin investing for their children as soon as they are born. He emphasized that whether parents choose index funds, individual stocks, or a combination of both, it is important to start early.\n\nCramer pointed out that there are many factors to consider when making investment decisions, especially age suitability. He advised parents to set up accounts for their kids or, at the very least, provide them with shares of stock as soon as possible. The goal is to begin the saving process from day one. He added:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about index funds, which aren\u2019t perfect, but they\u2019re the best way to go if you want to put your money on autopilot and you can\u2019t spend a lot of time looking at individual stocks\u2026 I\u2019m partial to cheap ETFs that mirror the S&P 500 because those 500 stocks represent the bedrock of America\u2019s publicly traded companies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO 13 Stocks Jim Cramer Recently Talked About and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts On These 8 Stocks and the Packaged Goods Playbook\n\nHe explained that, when investing for an infant, there is plenty of time for the money to grow, with compounding offering significant long-term benefits. As Cramer put it:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying for an infant who\u2019s got their whole life ahead of them, their whole life. These kinds of things can really compound over time, meaning if you let it run, then money can build up on itself.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing what stocks to pick for a newborn, Cramer suggested two types of investments: those with dividends, which can be reinvested to take advantage of the compounding effect, and growth stocks which have the potential for higher returns over time. He recommended selecting well-known names that offer both dividends and growth potential, as they can provide a balance of stability and upside.\n\nFor parents looking to open an investment account for their children, Cramer recommended setting up a Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account. As children grow older, Cramer stressed the importance of involving them in the investing process.\n\n\u201cI think you should do everything in your power to get your kids involved in investing in stocks, teaching that stocks represent pieces of companies that they might like.\u201d\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that teenagers can be tough to engage when it comes to topics like stocks. \u201cTeenagers are incorrigible,\u201d Cramer quipped, \u201cThe last thing they want to hear about is stocks.\u201d As a result, he advocated for letting teenagers take the lead and choose stocks they are passionate about, rather than dictating what they should buy.\n\nCramer also observed that teenagers tend to avoid phone calls but are drawn to apps. In fact, he noted that delivery apps, which he initially did not understand, have completely transformed the way we shop and interact with technology. Cramer reflected on how products designed for tech-savvy users were not targeting older generations like him, but now, those same apps dominate the market.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Please buy your kids a few shares in a name brand that they know and you know. Something they can see and hear and touch then put it away.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 17 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is among Cramer\u2019s kid-friendly stock picks. While recounting technology\u2019s integration into his kids\u2019 lives, Cramer briefly mentioned the company, and said, \u201cWhat else? Fabulous. Google it, dad. Yeah, that\u2019s how I found out about Google, now Alphabet.\u201d\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a range of products and services, including ads, cloud solutions, AI, devices, and various digital platforms like Google Search, YouTube, and Google Maps, along with enterprise tools and healthcare-related services.\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company\u2019s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they\u2019re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 15th on our list of best stocks for kids according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) has delivered great gains to investors over time -- advancing 600% over the past decade, for example, and rising in the double digits just last year as investors piled into the biggest tech stocks. The owner of top search engine Google also has an established track record of earnings growth, making it a company investors know they can count on over time.\n\nSo you might expect to pay a lot to get in on Alphabet shares today. But this tech powerhouse, after a pullback in the shares in recent days, right now is trading at its lowest level in months. Why the decline? Investors were disappointed when Alphabet's quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates -- and capital spending plans exceeded estimates.\n\nNow, let's consider whether we, too, should worry about the company's latest announcements -- or if this tech giant is a no-brainer bargain buy.\n\nLet's \"Google it\"\n\nFirst, a bit of background on Alphabet. You probably know the company best for something most of us use every day: Google Search. It's such a popular search engine, holding about 90% of the global market, that it's even part of our vocabulary today. If we don't know the answer to a question, we'll \"Google it.\"\n\nAnd this has become Alphabet's key to revenue. Advertisers pay to advertise their products and services to us as we use the Google platform -- generating billions of dollars in earnings for Alphabet.\n\nOn top of this, Alphabet also has a cloud business, sells devices, and operates an autonomous vehicle unit called Waymo.\n\nAdvertising across Alphabet's platforms, and sales of products and services through the cloud business, have helped the company's earnings to advance over time. Return on invested capital also has increased, showing Alphabet has benefited from its investments.\n\nNow, let's turn to the recent quarter. Though fourth-quarter earnings per share, at $2.15, slightly exceeded estimates, Alphabet's revenue of $96.47 billion fell short of the $96.56 billion expected by analysts. Meanwhile, the company said capital expenditures would reach $75 billion this year, well beyond the less than $59 billion analysts had predicted.\n\nGrowth of Google Services and Cloud\n\nThose two elements disappointed investors, but it's important to consider the full picture. If we look at Alphabet's revenue breakdown, Google Services and Google Cloud each reported double-digit revenue gains -- only the smaller businesses that fall into the \"other bets\" category saw a drop in revenue. So, Alphabet's key revenue drivers continue to offer a significant amount of growth.\n\nIt's also important to consider the progress of Google Cloud in recent times. In the quarter, revenue climbed to more than $11 billion, and operating income reached beyond $2 billion. Google Cloud offers a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered products and services, and these are driving growth -- last year, the number of first-time commitments doubled from the previous year, and the number of deals surpassing $250 million doubled too. This highlights the importance of Alphabet's investment in AI infrastructure, to set the stage for this growth to continue.\n\nAs for search, Alphabet's investments in AI are driving improvements in the search engine, offering users more variety and precision when it comes to answers -- and Alphabet says new offerings like AI Overviews are resulting in more use and greater satisfaction.\n\nOf course, keep in mind that Alphabet faces one particular headwind at the moment. A U.S. court ruled against the company in an antitrust case last year, and the Justice Department aims to force Alphabet to sell the Chrome browser. It's clear Alphabet will fight any such request, and I think the government -- as in previous occasions, such as the 1998 case against Microsoft -- will have difficulty completely upsetting the status quo. So, while the case is a risk, I wouldn't let it stop me from buying Alphabet stock.\n\nNow, let's consider valuation. Following the recent share price decline, Alphabet now is trading at 20x forward earnings estimates, down from more than 24x just a few weeks ago. Considering Alphabet's solid earnings track record, its market leadership, and growth in both of its main businesses, this level looks dirt cheap -- and that makes Alphabet a no-brainer bargain stock to buy right now on the dip.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses with insights on President Trump\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico and their impact on the car industry. Large US car manufacturers, particularly the firm that makes the F-150 truck, have their manufacturing plants based in Mexico. As a result, they can face significant disruption if import costs from the country increase in the aftermath of tariffs.\n\nHowever, while American car manufacturers are dependent on Mexico, Cramer pointed out that Japanese and South Korean car companies depend on their respective countries for imports. Since neither country has been targeted by tariffs, he wondered whether they could be next.\n\nAnother one of Trump\u2019s remarks that caught the CNBC TV host\u2019s attention was his demand that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates. The President has preferred low interest rates for quite some time, and his remarks in January that stressed that he would call on central banks worldwide to lower rates weakened the US dollar. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements, Cramer wondered \u201cis this discord or is it just a recognition that\u2019s just not the way to go.\u201d He added, \u201cI think the Treasury Secretary has won the President over in terms of the notion of, listen I\u2019ve got it under control, let me handle it, you don\u2019t need to yell at the Fed.\u201d\n\nCramer believes that simply demanding that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates might not yield any results. Referring to co-host David Faber, he shared \u201cDavid, yelling at the Fed, yelling at Jerome Powell, sucker\u2019s game. Doesn\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d Cramer believes \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t want to get in a sucker\u2019s game where he yells at the guy, and the guy then says look I really don\u2019t care what this President says. Because he doesn\u2019t like. . . . He likes fealty.\u201d\n\nAnother government official Cramer mentioned was Commerce Secretary Scott Bessent. In his previous shows, Cramer has praised Bessent and shared that he has heard good things about the Secretary. He maintained the positivity and shared:\n\n\u201cThis guy [Secretary Bessent] he\u2019s making a lot of sense I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to [get] the oil up . . .three million barrels. But I would say that he\u2019s a supreme intellect, and people who know him or read about him are kind of saying, wow, this guy\u2019s a stand up, take notice. . . he\u2019s a great practitioner of the game.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "With a market capitalization of $61.4 billion, Snowflake (SNOW) helps businesses derive meaningful insights from their data, build data-driven applications, and facilitate data sharing. It works with service partners who provide industry expertise and technical guidance to help customers maximize their data and AI initiatives using its platform.\n\nFounded in 2012, one of its main products is its Data Cloud. This platform enables organizations to consolidate, analyze, and share data from a single source. Moreover, Data Cloud operates across major cloud providers, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), offering customers seamless integration and global accessibility.\n\nSnowflake went public in September 2020 and currently trades over 50% below all-time highs. Alphabet recently fully divested its stake in Snowflake, selling 114,554 shares in the fourth quarter of 2024. The exit marks the end of a position that began in early 2022, when the tech giant scooped up 535,604 Snowflake shares.\n\nGoogle significantly reduced its stake in Q3 2024 when it sold 421,050 Snowflake shares. Despite having a partnership with Snowflake, Alphabet\u2019s reasons for the complete exit remain unclear. While Snowflake faced challenges in 2024, including CEO Frank Slootman\u2019s retirement and a 22% stock decline, its shares have rebounded in 2025 with a 19% gain in the year to date.\n\nIs Snowflake Stock a Good Buy in 2025?\n\nIn the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended in October), Snowflake\u2019s product revenue was $900 million, up 29% year over year. The company continues strengthening its market position through enhanced AI capabilities, product innovation, and strategic partnerships.\n\nUnder CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy\u2019s leadership, Snowflake is seeing significant adoption of its AI features. It has deployed 1,000 use cases and more than 3,200 accounts that utilize its AI and ML capabilities.\n\nThe company recently announced a partnership with Anthropic to integrate advanced AI models through Snowflake Cortex AI. The collaboration should help enterprises develop cutting-edge AI applications with built-in security and governance.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s success is mainly due to its ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Large enterprises are choosing Snowflake as their data foundation. Further, customers who migrate from other providers have reported up to 50% in cost savings.\n\nMajor brands such as Hyatt (H), NBC Universal, and Toyota (TM) also leverage Snowflake\u2019s platform for various applications, from personalizing guest experiences to managing streaming content recommendations.\n\nIn the past four quarters, it has booked over $3.9 billion, a 68% increase from the previous period. Snowflake is also expanding its capabilities through strategic moves, including the planned acquisition of Datavolo, which will enhance its connectivity platform for both structured and unstructured data.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s financial performance remains strong. It ended fiscal Q3 with remaining performance obligations of $5.7 billion, showing 55% year-over-year growth. In Q3, it maintained a non-GAAP operating margin of 6% while continuing to invest in innovation and market expansion.\n\nIs Snowflake Stock Overvalued?\n\nSnowflake has increased its fiscal 2025 product revenue guidance to $3.43 billion, up 29% year over year. Comparatively, analysts expect sales to rise from $2.8 billion in 2024 to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2027. Its free cash flow is projected to expand from $813 million in 2024 to $1.5 billion in 2027. So, priced at 40.6x forward FCF, the tech stock commands a premium due to its stellar growth estimates.\n\nOut of the 42 analysts covering SNOW stock, 29 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three recommend \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d nine recommend \u201cHold,\u201d and one recommends \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d The average target price for SNOW stock is $191.62, marginally higher than the current trading price.",

            "content": "In 2007, the mayor of a city in southeastern T\u00fcrkiye mailed cards wishing his citizens a Happy Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Shortly after, charges were made against the mayor \u2026 for having used an illegal letter of the alphabet.\n\nThe mayor had broken what was colloquially called the \u201calphabet law.\u201d Back in 1928, T\u00fcrkiye changed its alphabet from an Arabic-based system to a Roman one\u2014and while the change was considered a major step in modernizing the country, the law came packaged with an unusual caveat: The letters q, w, and x were forbidden. (In the Turkish language, the legal spelling of the Persian festival was Nevruz.)\n\nThe charges against the mayor were eventually dropped, but others haven't been so lucky. Two years earlier, 20 people were fined 100 lira for making the same mistake. In the London Review of Books, Yasmine Seale explains why the law was created in the first place:\n\n\u201cRomanisation, it was argued, would help standardise Turkish spelling, improve literacy, and allow for cheaper and more convenient printing (the Arabic script required more than 400 pieces of type). But the reform had other, political aims: imposing cultural homogeneity and assimilating Turkey\u2019s minorities. New characters were added to the alphabet to accommodate Turkish phonology\u2014\u011f, \u0131, \u00fc, \u015f\u2014while others were left out. By adhering so closely to the specifics of Turkish and outlawing all other Latin characters (and all other scripts), it effectively proscribed written expression in any language other than Turkish\u2014not least Kurdish.\u201d\n\nKurdish people compose about 20 percent of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s population, and letters such as q, w, and x are commonly used in their own language. As Mark Liberman writes at Slate, \u201crestricting a minority language \u2026 is one way to oppress a minority.\u201d (In fact, it was technically illegal to speak Kurdish in public until the 1990s.)\n\nKurds bore the brunt of the alphabet law: Any Kurdish person whose name contained a q, w, or x, for example, could not have those letters included on his or her official ID card. For everybody else, the law was loosely enforced. Visitors to Istanbul surely noted giant billboards advertising Xerox copiers or bathroom doors in tourist areas stamped with the letters W.C. \u201cTurks have long flouted the ban because, even though these letters are not used in traditional Turkish words, they are common in words loaned from English and other languages,\u201d Dalia Mortada reported for PRI.\n\nBut finally, on September 30, 2013, the letters q, w, and x were legalized\u2014though they were not added to the Turkish alphabet. In the meantime, the Turkish government has found new excuses to litigate against its mayors: In 2015 the mayor of Ankara was sued after he used public funds to build a giant statue of a robot. (It was later replaced \u2026 with a dinosaur.)\n\nDiscover More Stories About Language:",

The e-commerce and cloud computing giant not only reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings but also delivered 10% year-over-year sales growth\u2014right in line with analyst projections.\n\nBut the real headline was Amazon\u2019s AI investment plans. In the most recent quarter, Amazon spent a staggering $26.3 billion on capital expenditures, signaling an intent to maintain that pace. That translates to more than $100 billion in annual capex, with the bulk of it dedicated to AI infrastructure.\n\nAmazon is doubling down on a trend sweeping through the mega-cap tech world, where hyperscalers are making massive AI infrastructure bets. Microsoft has committed $85 billion to capex, and Alphabet $75 billion. These investments are so significant that, according to BlackRock, the Magnificent 7\u2019s capital expenditures now surpass the US government\u2019s R&D spending.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock, along with the rest of the Magnificent 7\u2014has delivered outstanding performance in recent years. But will shareholders embrace this unprecedented spending spree, or will concerns about capital allocation start to weigh on the stock? Let\u2019s dive into the implications of Amazon\u2019s AI gamble.\n\nHow Will This Affect AMZN, GOOGL and MSFT Stock?\n\nFor the record, I\u2019m a firm believer in the AI boom and its transformative potential. I was an early adopter of large language models (LLMs) and continue to use them regularly across multiple domains. Not only are these tools bafflingly useful, but they are also improving almost weekly. For those still skeptical, just look at OpenAI\u2019s recent release of \u2018Deep Research\u2019, a specialized AI model capable of conducting multi-step, high-level analysis.\n\nI bring this up because my outlook on Amazon and the broader Magnificent 7 may seem counterintuitive given my enthusiasm for AI. I do believe that this massive capex push will ultimately generate significant returns, but the path there won\u2019t be easy\u2014especially for shareholders in the near term. Spending $100 billion annually is a staggering number, and it may not be immediately clear how this will translate into higher profitability in the near term.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "The market's impressive performance created numerous trillion-dollar companies. Due to their remarkable successes, these businesses have for the most part earned their place among the elite group.\n\nThere's one particular industry-leading, tech-forward enterprise -- with a market cap of $434 billion -- that is rapidly ascended the ranks. It deserves to be in the discussion as a possible entrant to the trillion-dollar crew in the future.\n\nCan this one unstoppable stock join Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla in the $1 trillion club by 2035?\n\nDominating the streaming landscape\n\nIn the past decade, shares of Netflix (NFLX -2.09%) soared 1,500%. That rise is due to the company's impressive job at disrupting the media industry. Netflix created the streaming category. And its focus on innovation to better serve consumers in the internet age certainly allows it to be mentioned in the same breath as the other dominant tech titans.\n\nGrowth has been a key part of the story. Netflix has 302 million subscribers in 190 countries across the globe. That's up from 167 million members from five years ago. This propelled revenue, which soared 15.6% in 2024.\n\nThe company keeps finding ways to attract a larger audience. Its efforts to crack down on password-sharing, as well as the successful launch of a cheaper ad-supported tier, are examples of steps management took to better monetize its platform. Getting into live events and sports to boost engagement is another way.\n\nIts ability to generate profits is exceptional. This is only possible because of Netflix's massive scale that stems from its first-mover advantage, which puts it ahead of the rest of the industry.\n\nManagement is aiming for a 29% operating margin this year, with free cash flow forecasted at $8 billion. Executives are focused on efficiently spending on content.\n\nAnd with proven pricing power, it's no surprise that Netflix's financial situation continues to improve. Because of the value it provides viewers, it has been able to raise subscription prices consistently. That's a wonderful trait to have.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nIn order for Netflix's market cap to reach $1 trillion in a decade, it would need to expand by 130%. In the past 10 years, its market cap has climbed 1,500%. So, investors are asking for a major slowdown to occur in order to hit that milestone. That seems reasonable, to say the least.\n\nThe valuation must be considered as well. As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 50.9. Assuming that multiple gets cut in half to 25 by 2035 (which I don't think is out of the question given that Netflix will be a much more mature enterprise in a decade), then this implies that earnings per share (EPS) need to grow about 16.5% per year.\n\nIn the past 10 years, EPS increased at a compound annual rate of 41.4%. Therefore, I think there's a very strong likelihood that based on its current trajectory, the company will indeed enter the exclusive $1 trillion club in 10 years.\n\nBe patient\n\nJust because the business is on its way to being valued at a 13-figure sum, it doesn't necessarily mean you should rush to buy the stock. To be clear, I still view the current valuation as being on the expensive side.\n\nYes, the business is thriving right now. But the P/E leaves no margin of safety for investors. Netflix must continue executing flawlessly with no hiccups to justify paying a steep price tag. The best thing investors should do is wait for a better entry point before buying this industry-leading company.",

            "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock took a hit last week after its Q4 earnings report received a thumbs down from Wall Street. The market\u2019s skepticism boiled down to one major concern: Alphabet\u2019s hefty AI spending \u2013 and whether it will truly pay off.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nManagement signaled no slowdown, projecting a $75 billion in FY25 capex to expand capacity for growing AI demand. But there are near-term challenges. Google Cloud\u2019s Q4 revenue growth came in softer than expected, and capacity constraints could drag on Q1 results. Moreover, while Alphabet remains focused on long-term cost discipline, expenses are set to rise in 2025 due to higher depreciation from elevated capex and increased investments in AI and Cloud talent.\n\nYet, there\u2019s a silver lining. Goldman Sachs\u2019 Eric Sheridan, an analyst ranked in the top 3% of Wall Street stock pros, highlights \u201ccontinued revenue momentum,\u201d driven by solid performance in Search across all verticals and better-than-expected YouTube Ads results. The company also pointed to positive early engagement with AI Overviews, particularly among younger users, progress in closing the monetization gap for YouTube Shorts, and optimism surrounding new AI initiatives such as Gemini, Project Mariner, and Project Astra.\n\nMeanwhile, operating margins also beat expectations, despite significant AI-related investments. Additionally, the company reinforced its commitment to shareholder returns through ~$15.51 billion in share repurchases in the quarter ($62.23 billion for FY2024) and a $0.20 per-share cash dividend.\n\nAlphabet also made the case that the Cloud business is well-positioned to benefit over the medium-to long-term from the growth of generative AI and a \u201cmore normalized overall enterprise computing landscape.\u201d Again, the key question for investors, says Sheridan, will be how the increased capex translates into long-term returns and \u201csustained revenue growth.\u201d\n\nAll told, looking at the big picture, Sheridan remains a firm GOOGL bull.\n\n\u201cAway from any short-term debates, we continue to view Alphabet as well-positioned against both the current (mixture of desktop and mobile utility) and potential future (AI/ML; personalization; lowered friction to applications) computing landscapes,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cWe continue to advocate that the combination of AI distribution at scale (collection 1b+ user applications) and scale of compute to both invest and drive efficiencies remain as a dual under-appreciated narrative in terms of AI over the long-term, particularly as we move from the \u2018infrastructure\u2019 to \u2018platform\u2019 and \u2018application\u2019 layers of AI monetization.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Sheridan rates GOOGL shares a Buy while his $220 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 18%. (To watch Sheridan\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in his bullish stance \u2013 26 other analysts share his optimism, while 10 remain on the sidelines with Hold ratings. As a result, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Based on the $215.85 average price target, GOOGL shares could climb ~16% in the coming year.

            "content": "1. Introduction\n\nIt operates a variety of consumer-facing and enterprise products, ranging from core search and online advertising to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) platforms and cloud services. These initiatives are underpinned by a robust ecosystem of tools\u2014YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android among them\u2014that collectively reinforce Alphabet\u2019s formidable presence.\n\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, the technology sector faces both tailwinds and headwinds. On one side, AI advancements and digital transformation efforts create unprecedented opportunities for growth in areas like cloud computing, data analytics, and marketing solutions. On the other side, macroeconomic uncertainties, rising competition, and intensifying regulatory scrutiny present challenges that major tech companies must navigate with prudence.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings report offers an incisive look at how this leading firm is balancing its powerful revenue engines against emerging growth avenues. Advertising remains its core profit center, while cloud computing\u2014particularly AI-driven applications\u2014represents a strategic focal point for future expansion. Concurrently, management has signaled it will significantly escalate capital expenditures (CAPEX) in 2025, investing billions in servers, data centers, and custom-designed chips (TPUs) to secure long-term leadership in AI infrastructure.\n\nYet, these initiatives come with a suite of risks. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to probe Alphabet\u2019s market practices, especially regarding its dominance in search. Additional concerns linger about near-term profitability, as aggressive spending can dampen margins and create potential volatility in free cash flow. The tension between capturing transformational opportunities in AI and cloud while maintaining comfortable profit margins exemplifies the broader story for tech giants in 2025.\n\nIn the sections that follow, this analysis delves into Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 performance, evaluating how each core segment\u2014search advertising, YouTube, cloud, and more\u2014contributed to the company\u2019s revenue and earnings trajectory. We further examine the rationale behind the rising CAPEX, contextualize Alphabet\u2019s valuation against the broader market, and explore the major risks on the horizon. Finally, we propose a multi-year outlook, considering various scenarios that may lead to different valuation outcomes for Alphabet\u2019s stock price. By the end of this discussion, it should be clear why Alphabet, despite near-term uncertainties, continues to be a central figure in the world of technology and remains a focal point for investors seeking exposure to growth in AI, data analytics, and digital advertising.\n\n2. Key Financial Highlights for Q4 2024\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 results showcased both strengths and emerging challenges. Below are the headline numbers reported:\n\nRevenue: Total quarterly revenue was $96.5 billion , marking a 12% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Although this slightly missed some analyst forecasts by a narrow margin, double-digit growth in a company of Alphabet\u2019s scale remains remarkable.\n\nThe revenue trajectory for the full year 2024 closed at around 14% YoY growth, which has now decelerated to 12% for Q4\u2014a likely indicator of natural slowing as the business matures, but still indicative of a robust core. Operating Income and Margins: Operating income reached $30.1 billion , a significant rise from approximately $26.1 billion a year ago.\n\nOperating margin improved from 27% in the same quarter last year to 32% this quarter, highlighting the company\u2019s focus on cost management and efficiency gains. Net Income and EPS: Net income for Q4 2024 stood at $26.5 billion , a 28% increase YoY.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.15, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.02. The figure was markedly higher than the $1.64 reported in Q4 2023. Market Reaction: Despite these seemingly strong numbers, Alphabet\u2019s stock price dropped about 7% in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release and settled around a 9% decline a few days later.\n\nAnalysts attributed this sell-off primarily to concerns over the slower-than-anticipated cloud revenue growth (30% vs. the 32% that some had expected) and the announcement of $75 billion in planned CAPEX for 2025 (a 43% increase over 2024). Long-Term Growth Themes: For a company with a top-line run rate of over $350 billion, maintaining double-digit percentage increases is far from trivial. Many interpret Alphabet\u2019s performance as evidence that it continues to capitalize on global digital transformation, harnessing the twin engines of advertising and cloud-based services.\n\nIn sum, Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 results were impressive by conventional measures: strong revenue, robust profit growth, and improved margins. However, the firm\u2019s shares were affected by heightened expectations in the cloud segment and the looming cost burdens associated with its rapidly rising CAPEX. The subsequent sections discuss these elements in detail to provide a more granular picture of Alphabet\u2019s near-term and long-term strategy.\n\n3. Advertising and YouTube: Sustaining Growth in Core Markets\n\n3.1 Core Search Advertising\n\nAlphabet\u2019s long-standing revenue juggernaut is Google Search. In Q4 2024, search advertising revenue rose by about 12.5% YoY\u2014an impressive figure in a relatively mature market. Retail advertising, specifically around the holiday season, drove much of that uptick. Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2024 each delivered over $1 billion in ad revenue, highlighting consumer enthusiasm for e-commerce and digital holiday promotions.\n\nSeveral factors underpin the durability of Alphabet\u2019s advertising business:\n\nDominant Search Market Share : Google commands nearly 89% of the global search market, giving it pricing power and unrivaled reach for advertisers.\n\nAdvanced Ad Targeting Tools : Ongoing investments in machine learning help advertisers optimize campaigns, driving better results and ROI.\n\nIntegration with Google Ecosystem: Synergies with Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and Android mean that advertisers can target users across a wide range of use cases.\n\nDespite these successes, there is a persistent question as to whether growth can remain robust over the long term. Macroeconomic headwinds and evolving consumer habits could, in theory, reduce ad spend, but the secular trend of digital marketing replacing traditional advertising suggests ongoing demand for Google Search placements. Moreover, as more users rely on the internet for everyday tasks, the volume of queries\u2014and thus the potential for ad impressions\u2014continues to increase.\n\n3.2 YouTube Advertising\n\nYouTube plays a pivotal role in Alphabet\u2019s advertising ecosystem. In Q4 2024, YouTube\u2019s ad revenue increased by 14% YoY. One noteworthy driver was political advertising tied to the U.S. election cycle, with combined expenditures by political parties almost double those of 2020. This influx of political ads benefited not only Alphabet\u2019s top line for the quarter but also underscores the platform\u2019s growing importance in reaching diverse, large-scale audiences.\n\nBeyond political ad spend, YouTube\u2019s sustained performance is rooted in:\n\nDominance in Video Content : The platform remains the most visited video site globally, hosting an expansive array of content from entertainment to tutorials and beyond.\n\nShorts and New Formats : YouTube\u2019s expansion into short-form videos competes effectively with platforms like TikTok. This helps capture younger demographics and drives incremental ad placements.\n\nSubscription Services: YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions, while not as large as ad revenues, represent additional monetization channels that can improve the overall revenue mix.\n\nCritics sometimes question YouTube\u2019s growth potential after major election cycles, given that political ad spend is cyclical and can distort quarterly numbers. Still, YouTube\u2019s multi-faceted approach\u2014combining short-form, long-form, live streaming, and subscription models\u2014positions it favorably for steady expansion.\n\nOverall, the continued momentum in Google Search and YouTube provides Alphabet with a stable financial foundation. These two segments regularly account for the majority of the company\u2019s quarterly revenue, which in turn supports long-term investments in emerging verticals like AI, cloud computing, and custom hardware.\n\n4. Cloud Business: Expansion, Competition, and AI Catalysts\n\n4.1 Performance and Growth Dynamics\n\nGoogle Cloud, encompassing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Workspace productivity tools, delivered $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2024\u2014a 30% YoY increase. Although that figure stands as robust growth, it modestly trailed market expectations of about $12.2 billion. The shortfall was one of the reasons cited for the stock\u2019s immediate dip post-earnings.\n\nConsidering Google Cloud\u2019s relatively smaller scale compared to Alphabet\u2019s dominant advertising operations, it is becoming an increasingly significant contributor to overall revenue. Management has repeatedly stated that the cloud business is critical for Alphabet\u2019s long-term diversification and forms a crucial pillar for the company\u2019s AI-driven future.\n\n4.2 Capacity Constraints and the Case for CAPEX\n\nOne prominent explanation for the slightly lower-than-expected cloud revenue growth is capacity constraints. Alphabet signaled that certain regions faced limitations in data center infrastructure, delaying the onboarding of some clients\u2019 workloads. Large enterprise deals, especially those requiring advanced AI compute capabilities, can strain existing infrastructure. This is precisely why management has committed to extensive capital expenditures in 2025\u2014to expand capacity, build additional data centers, and deploy more servers capable of handling AI-specific tasks.\n\nDespite these constraints, the outlook remains upbeat. Google Cloud reportedly secured multiple high-value deals in 2024, with several topping $1 billion in contract value. Moreover, the number of new, first-time commitments doubled YoY. Major customers like MercadoLibre and Mercedes-Benz are tapping into Google\u2019s advanced analytics, AI frameworks, and global network to transform their operations.\n\n4.3 Competitive Context: AWS vs. Azure vs. Google Cloud\n\nWhile Google Cloud\u2019s 30% growth is impressive, it must be understood within the landscape of the top three cloud providers:\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) : Grew by about 19% in Q4 2024, holding roughly 31% market share.\n\nMicrosoft Azure : Posted a 31% YoY gain in Q4 2024, with around 20% market share.\n\nGoogle Cloud: Up 30% YoY, at approximately 11% share.\n\nGoogle Cloud remains the third-largest hyperscaler but has shown consistently high growth relative to AWS and is keeping pace with Azure. The secular tailwinds for all three providers\u2014digital transformation, AI/ML adoption, data analytics\u2014remain powerful. Even if Google never exceeds AWS or Azure in market share, it can still grow meaningfully as the overall cloud market expands, potentially reaching trillions of dollars in total addressable market size by the end of the decade.\n\n4.4 AI-Driven Differentiators\n\nA distinguishing element of Google Cloud\u2019s strategy is its emphasis on AI tools and services. Products like Vertex AI, BigQuery, and the integration of Google\u2019s AI research (think generative models, natural language processing, and custom silicon) give enterprises a strong incentive to choose GCP for next-generation workloads. The synergy between AI advancements and large-scale cloud infrastructure appears critical to Google\u2019s plan for capturing new customers and deepening relationships with existing ones.\n\nEnterprises often favor providers that can handle complex AI workloads in a cost-effective manner while offering user-friendly development tools. Google\u2019s custom TPUs\u2014discussed further below\u2014are an essential piece of this differentiation. If these investments continue to produce strong results, GCP might not only retain but accelerate growth in strategic sectors like automotive, healthcare, and retail, where advanced AI workloads are becoming standard.\n\n5. Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) in 2025: Balancing Growth and Profitability\n\n5.1 The $75 Billion Commitment\n\nAlphabet\u2019s announcement of $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025 has drawn widespread attention. In 2024, the company spent $52.5 billion, indicating that this new target is a 43% increase. This significant allocation underscores the company\u2019s pursuit of a leadership position in AI, cloud, and data analytics, all of which demand state-of-the-art infrastructure.\n\nThe bulk of this spending is expected to finance:\n\nData Center Expansion : Building and upgrading facilities worldwide to meet rising demand for AI-centric computing tasks.\n\nServer Procurement : Deploying next-generation servers to process training and inference for large-scale AI models.\n\nNetworking Equipment : Ensuring low-latency, high-bandwidth connections for global customers.\n\nCustom Silicon: Ongoing development and deployment of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), with each new generation aiming to deliver cost and performance benefits.\n\n5.2 Justification for the High Outlay\n\nTwo primary factors underpin management\u2019s decision to accelerate CAPEX:\n\nMeeting Demand for AI: The computational intensity of AI workloads, especially large language models (LLMs) and generative applications, far exceeds that of standard business applications. Enterprises increasingly require advanced hardware that can deliver high performance without compromising cost-effectiveness. Infrastructure Constraints: Alphabet has hinted that certain deals in Q4 2024 were constrained or delayed due to limited capacity. By preemptively scaling infrastructure, Google aims to avoid bottlenecks and seize market share more rapidly.\n\nCritics, however, voice concerns that near-term free cash flow and earnings could be pressured by such high spending. Large capital outlays translate into rising depreciation costs over several years, which may dampen net income if top-line growth doesn\u2019t accelerate in tandem. Investors who prioritize short-term results might question whether these capital deployments will yield sufficient returns.\n\n5.3 Benchmarking Against Peers\n\nOther major technology companies are also boosting CAPEX, but Alphabet\u2019s planned figure outstrips several peers:\n\nMeta Platforms : Expected to spend $60-65 billion in 2025, directed largely at AI infrastructure and the metaverse.\n\nMicrosoft : Steadily increasing its CAPEX for Azure, though the company has not laid out an explicit figure as large as Alphabet\u2019s $75 billion.\n\n\n\nIn a marketplace shaped by intensifying AI competition, many industry observers see Alphabet\u2019s move as strategically necessary to preserve and enhance its leadership. The opportunity costs of under-investing in AI hardware could be severe, risking ceding ground to AWS, Azure, or other emerging players. Alphabet evidently believes that controlling the design and implementation of advanced servers and chips will be a lasting competitive advantage.\n\n6. Regulatory and Antitrust Considerations\n\n6.1 Background and Core Issues\n\nAlphabet continues to face a high-profile antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). At the heart of the government\u2019s allegations is Google\u2019s near-monopoly in search\u2014hovering around 89% global market share\u2014and contractual arrangements that make Google the default search engine on various devices and browsers. These deals, the DOJ argues, restrict competition by limiting user choice and entrenching Google\u2019s dominance.\n\nAdditionally, regulators have explored the idea of forcing Alphabet to divest certain assets, most notably the Chrome browser. Chrome does not directly generate advertising revenue in the same manner as search, but it acts as a gateway for billions of users, creating synergies with Google\u2019s ecosystem (YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc.).\n\n6.2 Potential Consequences\n\nIf the DOJ\u2014or other regulators globally\u2014were to impose strict remedies, several scenarios are possible:\n\nDivestiture of Chrome: This would break a key link between Google\u2019s services. While some analysts estimate Chrome might be valued at $20 billion if spun off, the strategic impact to Alphabet\u2019s integrated ecosystem could be disproportionately larger. Restrictions on Default Search Deals: Alphabet currently pays significant traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to manufacturers like Apple and Samsung, ensuring Google is the default search on their devices. Any forced changes to these deals could weaken Google\u2019s funnel, although brand recognition might still allow Google to remain the top choice for most users. Fines and Monitoring: Regulators could impose financial penalties and require Alphabet to make changes to data sharing and interoperability practices.\n\n6.3 Political Environment and Alphabet\u2019s Strategic Posture\n\nThe political climate can shape the enforcement of antitrust measures. Some observers believe that potential shifts in U.S. presidential administrations or congressional leadership might soften the DOJ\u2019s stance and result in a settlement. In any event, antitrust litigation typically extends over several years, creating a degree of uncertainty that might weigh on Alphabet\u2019s stock valuation in the near term.\n\nDespite this overhang, Google\u2019s leadership has emphasized that any regulatory changes would likely not undermine the fundamental viability of its core businesses. The combination of strong user preference for Google\u2019s search engine, a constantly evolving product suite, and the historically lenient remedies in large tech antitrust cases leads many to anticipate a resolution that would not radically diminish Alphabet\u2019s strategic position.\n\n7. AI Initiatives and Custom Silicon: Driving the Next Wave\n\n7.1 AI-Powered Search and Product Enhancements\n\nOne prominent theme in 2024 was Alphabet\u2019s active deployment of AI features across its product stack. By Q4, the company was rolling out Gemini 2.0\u2014an advanced generative AI model integrated into search for more direct, contextual answers to user queries. This approach mirrors some of the capabilities introduced by competitors in conversational search, but Google\u2019s scale and data breadth potentially give it an edge.\n\nEarly testers of AI-enabled search see summarized responses (or \u201cAI snapshots\u201d), adding a new layer of utility to simple queries. While it might impact the dynamics of search ads in the long run\u2014particularly if more direct answers reduce the need for users to click through to websites\u2014Alphabet\u2019s overarching view is that improved user experience will translate to sustained loyalty and, ultimately, monetization opportunities.\n\n7.2 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Custom Silicon\n\nAlphabet\u2019s ongoing investment in custom silicon is another cornerstone of its AI strategy. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialized chips designed to accelerate machine learning workloads. The company claims that its latest generation, often referred to as \u201cTrillium\u201d or TPU v6, offers up to a fourfold performance boost compared to previous versions.\n\nThe advantage of designing custom AI hardware in-house is multifaceted:\n\nPerformance Optimization : TPUs can be tuned for specific frameworks such as TensorFlow, resulting in faster training times and lower energy usage compared to general-purpose GPUs.\n\nCost Advantages : By reducing dependence on third-party vendors like Nvidia or AMD, Alphabet can theoretically lower its infrastructure costs and pass savings to enterprise cloud customers.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation: Offering enterprises specialized hardware can be a selling point for GCP over competing providers that do not have proprietary AI chips.\n\nYet, custom hardware development does carry execution risks. Research and development expenditures are substantial, and any missteps in chip design can lead to delays and cost overruns. Success, however, would likely solidify Alphabet\u2019s position as a leading AI platform, further justifying the large CAPEX for data center build-outs that house these TPUs.\n\n7.3 AI Adoption in Enterprise Settings\n\nBeyond consumer products, large organizations in finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing increasingly rely on AI to automate tasks and glean insights from massive data sets. Google Cloud\u2019s ability to provide integrated AI solutions\u2014ranging from advanced analytics and natural language processing to specialized hardware\u2014positions it well to capture these enterprise workloads.\n\nCase studies abound of organizations that leverage GCP to reduce operating costs, enhance customer experiences, or drive new product innovation. To the extent that Google can continue rapidly integrating generative AI capabilities, it might attract an even broader swath of enterprise clients, many of whom are still in the early innings of AI adoption.\n\n8. Operating Performance and Profit Margins\n\n8.1 Operating Margins\n\nAlphabet\u2019s operating margin increased to 32% in Q4 2024 from 27% a year earlier, illustrating meaningful year-over-year efficiency gains. This improvement demonstrates the company\u2019s capacity to control operating costs while still investing in growth-oriented projects. Critics often point out that ballooning spending on AI infrastructure and data centers could erode future margins. However, the Q4 results suggest Alphabet has found ways to balance existing profitability drivers (like search ads) against heavier investments.\n\n8.2 Cost Discipline vs. Growth Investments\n\nDriving margins higher in the face of increased spending requires disciplined cost management, especially in headcount, marketing, and noncore initiatives. Alphabet is no stranger to resource misalignment\u2014over the years, it has invested in experimental \u201cmoonshots\u201d through its Other Bets segment. Yet, the search and advertising juggernaut typically finances these bets handily. The bigger question is whether the AI arms race will demand a sustained level of expenditure that outpaces revenue growth.\n\nOne key area to watch is depreciation, which will inevitably rise as Alphabet capitalizes a greater portion of its CAPEX into data center equipment and custom chips. Over time, higher depreciation could narrow the gap between operating income and net income, although if top-line expansion matches or exceeds the rate of spending, margin compression may be modest.\n\n8.3 Benchmarking Against Peers\n\nCompanies like Meta and Microsoft are also juggling growth investments with margin objectives. Meta has improved efficiency by reducing headcount and refocusing on its most profitable areas, while Microsoft has historically kept steady margins even as it scales Azure. Alphabet\u2019s Q4 margin outperformance suggests that its core businesses are healthy enough to support significant expansions, which is a bullish sign for long-term profitability.\n\n9. Valuation and Comparisons with Broader Market\n\n9.1 P/E Ratios and Historical Averages\n\nAlphabet\u2019s blended price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands around 22.8x based on early 2025 metrics. This level is slightly below the company\u2019s 15-year average of around 24.4x. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trades closer to 25.16x, exceeding its long-term average of 19.85x. By this measure, Alphabet appears attractively priced relative to a broader market that some observers believe is overvalued.\n\nHowever, some discount may be justified if investors are factoring in regulatory risk and the uncertainty around heavy CAPEX. In other words, part of the reason Alphabet trades below the index\u2019s multiple could be skepticism regarding the return on upcoming AI investments and the potential repercussions of antitrust actions.\n\n9.2 EPS Growth Projections\n\nFactSet analysts project Alphabet\u2019s EPS to evolve as follows:\n\n2025 : $8.89 (around 11% growth)\n\n2026 : $10.17 (14% growth)\n\n2027: $11.66 (15% growth)\n\nThese are healthy mid-double-digit growth rates, particularly for a mega-cap company of Alphabet\u2019s scale. If realized, such consistent EPS expansion could warrant a valuation multiple higher than 22.8x, especially once regulatory overhangs clear and investors gain more visibility into the payoffs of AI and cloud investments.\n\n10. Competitive Landscape Among Major Tech Players\n\n10.1 Amazon\n\nAmazon\u2019s primary synergy with Alphabet revolves around cloud and advertising. AWS remains the leading cloud provider, although its growth (19% in Q4 2024) is slower than that of Google Cloud. Moreover, Amazon\u2019s ad business\u2014anchored by its e-commerce marketplace\u2014has grown rapidly but is still smaller than Google\u2019s core search plus YouTube revenue streams. Nonetheless, Amazon\u2019s vertical integration in retail and media means it has multiple ways to gather user data, which could eventually challenge Alphabet\u2019s dominance in certain advertising niches.\n\n10.2 Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Azure\u2019s 31% growth is marginally higher than Google Cloud\u2019s 30%, indicating a tight race for second place in the public cloud market behind AWS. Microsoft\u2019s recent investments in AI, particularly through its partnership with OpenAI, underscore its ambition to integrate cutting-edge language models across its productivity suite and cloud platform. While it lacks Google\u2019s entrenched position in search, it does pose competition for enterprise AI workloads, as many large corporate clients already have close ties to Microsoft\u2019s Office and Windows ecosystems.\n\n10.3 Meta Platforms\n\nMeta shares Alphabet\u2019s heavy focus on digital advertising, though through different channels (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp). Meta\u2019s guidance for CAPEX in 2025 ($60\u201365 billion) parallels Alphabet\u2019s large outlays for AI, suggesting that both see computational innovation as central to future growth. Meta\u2019s short-form video push through Reels competes more directly with YouTube\u2019s new formats, but the overall ad market is large enough to accommodate both players. The real question is which platform best adapts to shifting user behavior and privacy regulations.\n\n10.4 Apple\n\nApple\u2019s relationship with Alphabet is multifaceted. On one hand, Google pays Apple an estimated $20+ billion annually for default placement as the search engine on iPhones. On the other hand, Apple\u2019s rumored in-house search initiatives could potentially reduce its reliance on Google. Apple\u2019s tight control of iOS devices might allow it to shape user behavior, a concern for Alphabet in the event that Apple chooses to divert traffic toward a competing search product or deepen relationships with Microsoft\u2019s Bing. However, given the enormous sums involved, Apple has substantial incentive to maintain a lucrative partnership with Alphabet.\n\n11. Risks and Potential Headwinds\n\n11.1 Regulatory and Legal Outcomes\n\nAlphabet\u2019s legal battles are the most prominent risk. A forced divestiture of Chrome or severe restrictions on default search deals could, in a worst-case scenario, disrupt a major source of traffic and revenue. Even without a drastic remedy, ongoing legal fights incur expenses, management distraction, and investor uncertainty.\n\n11.2 CAPEX and Margin Compression\n\nSpending $75 billion in a single year on data centers, servers, and chips will substantially increase Alphabet\u2019s depreciation expenses. If revenue growth disappoints, profit margins could decline, leading to underperformance in quarterly earnings. While many analysts view these investments as necessary, the sheer magnitude of the outlay leaves Alphabet susceptible to overshooting capacity or encountering supply chain problems.\n\n11.3 Foreign Exchange (FX) Fluctuations\n\nWith more than half of Alphabet\u2019s revenue deriving from outside the United States, currency swings can significantly impact reported revenues and earnings. A strengthening U.S. dollar would reduce the value of foreign sales when translated back to USD, potentially depressing top-line growth rates in future quarters.\n\n11.4 Intense Competition in AI\n\nThe AI landscape is no longer the domain of a few tech giants; numerous startups and alternative players are developing specialized chips, large language models, and advanced analytics tools. If Alphabet\u2019s AI initiatives fail to keep pace with competition\u2014or if open-source solutions match Google\u2019s offerings for free\u2014the competitive edge Alphabet expects to monetize through GCP and specialized AI services could narrow.\n\n11.5 Macroeconomic Factors\n\nA global economic slowdown can influence advertising budgets, e-commerce activity, and enterprise spending on cloud services. While digital channels historically rebound more quickly than traditional channels post-recessions, any cyclical downturn could result in short-term hits to Alphabet\u2019s revenue growth.\n\n12. Long-Term Outlook and Price Targets\n\n12.1 Consensus View\n\nMany Wall Street analysts maintain a \u201cBuy\u201d or \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on Alphabet, with 12- to 18-month price targets ranging from $220 to $280. These targets reflect varying degrees of optimism regarding the company\u2019s ability to:\n\nNavigate antitrust risks without severe structural changes.\n\nAchieve a healthy return on its large CAPEX allocations.\n\nMonetize AI enhancements in search, YouTube, and cloud computing.\n\nSustain double-digit growth in its core ad business.\n\n12.2 Bullish Scenario\n\nIn a bullish case, Alphabet could surge toward $300 or more by 2027 if several conditions align:\n\nMinimal Regulatory Disruption: The DOJ settlement might only involve smaller fines and modest concessions, leaving Google\u2019s main revenue engines intact. Successful AI Rollouts: Enhanced search and new enterprise AI tools could open significant revenue streams, particularly if GCP wins large-scale, recurring contracts from blue-chip customers. Market Re-Rating: With mid-teens EPS growth, the market might assign Alphabet a premium multiple of 24\u201326x earnings, in line with or above its historical average.\n\n12.3 Base Case\n\nUnder a more moderate scenario, Alphabet\u2019s share price might settle in a $220\u2013$250 range, reflecting:\n\nSteady but Slower Growth : Core search and YouTube maintain double-digit growth, while Cloud grows around 25\u201330%.\n\nManageable CAPEX Impact : High investments weigh on free cash flow, but rising AI-driven revenue offsets a portion of the added costs.\n\nRegulatory Adjustments: An incremental settlement or compliance measures that do not radically alter the company\u2019s search dominance.\n\n12.4 Bearish Scenario\n\nIf regulatory action is stricter or if AI investments fail to meet expectations, Alphabet\u2019s share price could linger below $200:\n\nSevere Antitrust Ruling: Forced divestitures or prohibitions on default deals hamper user acquisition for search, reducing ad revenues materially. Over-Investment in CAPEX: Data center expansions and custom chips might not pay off quickly, compressing margins and earnings for an extended period. Competitive Erosion: Rivals like Microsoft and Amazon could seize more cloud market share, while smaller AI specialists offer cutting-edge solutions at lower cost.\n\nIn this scenario, investors might demand a lower multiple for Alphabet\u2019s stock in view of the heightened risks and uncertain growth profile.\n\n13. Conclusion\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings performance underscores the company\u2019s capacity to sustain robust revenue and profit growth even as it embarks on ambitious new initiatives. Core advertising segments\u2014Google Search and YouTube\u2014remain dominant and financially lucrative, supporting a multitude of innovative ventures. The cloud division, though slightly short of high-end expectations, continues to expand at a healthy clip and stands to benefit from surging enterprise demand for AI workloads.\n\nSimultaneously, the company faces a pair of formidable challenges. First, it must navigate mounting regulatory scrutiny regarding its market practices in search. Second, it must execute efficiently on its plan to spend $75 billion in CAPEX throughout 2025, predominantly aimed at AI and cloud infrastructure. If Alphabet manages to address both challenges successfully, the reward could be substantial: continued market leadership in AI-powered services, a deeper enterprise footprint through Google Cloud, and a return to valuation multiples consistent with its historical norms.\n\nFor long-term investors, the critical question is whether Alphabet\u2019s near-term headwinds\u2014ranging from antitrust action to heightened capital spending\u2014can be outweighed by its potential for sustained double-digit EPS growth. Many analysts remain optimistic, highlighting the firm\u2019s consistent profitability, strong cash balance, and the secular growth of digital advertising and cloud-based AI. On the other hand, skeptics point to the risk of slower payback periods for heavy infrastructure investments, potential regulatory constraints, and intensifying competition in AI.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, Alphabet\u2019s foundational strengths remain difficult to replicate. Its unparalleled search platform, broad advertising ecosystem, innovative cloud AI solutions, and cutting-edge custom chips give it levers that few competitors can match. These strengths, combined with relatively attractive valuations compared to the broader S&P 500, provide a compelling thesis for investors who can tolerate the ups and downs associated with transformative initiatives and evolving legal landscapes.\n\nIn sum, Alphabet stands at a pivotal juncture. Q4 2024 illustrated both its enduring core and the scope of its long-term ambitions. If the firm deftly manages regulatory risks and extracts value from its massive AI investments, it may reaffirm its status as one of the world\u2019s premier technology enterprises\u2014positioned not just to compete, but to lead in the emerging era of AI-driven innovation",

            "content": "In January, Chinese start-up DeepSeek introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that quickly became the most downloaded free mobile application in the U.S. Importantly, the base large language model behind the DeepSeek application allegedly cost $6 million to train and reportedly outperforms top U.S. models on certain benchmarks.\n\nThat shook Wall Street because OpenAI spent over $100 million training its GPT-4 model and supposedly had access to more advanced chips than DeepSeek. Investors rushed to the conclusion that U.S. companies have been overspending on AI infrastructure, and Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) shares fell 17% on the news, erasing $600 billion in market value. That is the largest single-day loss in U.S. history.\n\nNvidia shares are still down by about 9% since DeepSeek rattled the market, and the stock is currently 13% off its all-time high. But Nvidia shareholders just got some good news from Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) and Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%). Read on to learn more.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are skeptical about the DeepSeek narrative\n\nMany analysts have praised DeepSeek for its engineering breakthroughs. The company reduced expenses by cutting down on data processing with innovative training techniques. However, several analysts also question whether DeepSeek has been completely forthcoming about its infrastructure and the associated costs.\n\nFor instance, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities wrote, \"Saying DeepSeek was built for $6 million with no Nvidia next generation hardware is likely a fictional story.\" Likewise, research company SemiAnalysis reports that DeepSeek not only had next-generation Nvidia GPUs but also incurred about $1.6 billion in expenses while training its model.\n\nImportantly, cost efficiencies could actually boost demand for Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) by enabling faster diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) through the economy. Put differently, if novel training methods reduce model development costs, more software companies will build AI products, increasing the total demand for Nvidia GPUs.\n\nAmazon and Google plan to invest even more aggressively in AI infrastructure\n\nLast week, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet reported fourth-quarter financial results. Both companies said capital expenditures would increase substantially in 2025, as they are currently supply-constrained where AI infrastructure is concerned.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy predicted costs associated with developing AI models will continue to fall. But he also said, \"I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI.\" And CFO Brian Olsavsky told analysts that capital spend may exceed $100 billion in 2025, up from $83 billion in 2024, due to demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai provided similar insights. He said a greater percentage of capital expenses are shifting toward inference as training becomes less expensive, implying DeepSeek's breakthroughs would not slow AI spending. Indeed, CFO Ana Ashkenazi told analysts that capital expenditures would total $75 billion in 2025, up from $52 billion in 2024, due primarily to investments in data centers, servers, and networking.\n\nThe capital spending guidance from Amazon and Google parent Alphabet corroborates the narrative that demand for Nvidia GPUs could actually increase as training costs decline because companies will shift their resources toward inference. Andy Jassy compared the situation to how cloud computing sales have actually increased over time despite cloud services becoming less expensive.\n\n\"What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses. But then they get excited about what else they could build that was always cost-prohibitive before, and they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per unit cost less. I think that is very much what's going to happen here in AI.\"\n\nWall Street still expects Nvidia's earnings to grow very quickly\n\nWall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will grow at 52% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026. That consensus makes the current valuation of 50 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Admittedly, analysts have set a very high bar, so the stock could fall sharply if Nvidia misses those expectations.\n\nHere is the bottom line: Nvidia shareholders worried about the DeepSeek drama can take a deep breath. Many analysts think more efficient AI training techniques will lead to greater demand for Nvidia GPUs. And evidence from the largest hyperscale cloud companies supports that conclusion.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI stocks dominating Wall Street.\n\nRepresentatives from around the world are going to be attending the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit at the Grand Palais on 10\u201311 February 2025. The summit will focus on harnessing the power of AI systems as well as the risks posed by them. From heads of state and government and leaders of international organizations to business leaders, as well as representatives from academia, civil society, and the arts, it would seem everyone related to the artificial intelligence world is to attend. However, that\u2019s not quite true.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nReuters has recently reported that the U.S. delegation to the AI Summit will not include technical staff from the country\u2019s AI Safety Institute. Vice President JD Vance is leading the U.S. contingent to France, with attendees including members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: Principal Deputy Director Lynne Parker and Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence Sriram Krishnan. However, Homeland Security and Commerce Department officials are not going to be there, particularly the representatives of the U.S. AI Safety Institute trips have been canceled.\n\nThe AI Safety Institute, created under former President Joe Biden, was created to mitigate certain risks from AI, having signed agreements with U.S. startups OpenAI and Anthropic for safety testing. The absence of these representatives implies that the Commerce Department, in which the Safety Institute resides, is still in the transition phase after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nRegarding the discussion on AI, Prof Gina Neff from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy said that there is currently \u201ca vacuum for global leadership on AI\u201d.\n\nAnother professor from Southampton University seems to agree:\n\n\u201cDeepSeek made everybody realize that China is a force to be reckoned with,\u201d says the computer scientist. We don\u2019t have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\u201d -Prof Dame Wendy Hall, Southampton University.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses. On February 5, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has removed a passage from its artificial intelligence principles that pledged to avoid using AI in potentially harmful applications, such as weapons. Previously, the company\u2019s AI principles included a passage titled \u201cAI applications we will not pursue,\u201d such as \u201ctechnologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm,\u201d including weapons, reported Bloomberg. However, the writing is no longer visible on the page.\n\nA Google spokesperson shared a blog post published Tuesday:\n\n\u201cWe believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality and respect for human rights. And we believe that companies, governments and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth and supports national security.\u201d \u2013 James Manyika, a senior vice president at Google, and Demis Hassabis, who leads the AI lab Google DeepMind.\n\nAccording to Margaret Mitchell, who co-led Google\u2019s ethical AI team and is now chief ethics scientist for AI startup Hugging Face, removing the clause may have implications for the nature of work Google pursues.\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks dominating Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

TSLA investor and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, Ross Gerber, voiced strong criticism of Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving system, particularly its performance on the Cybertruck, amid the company\u2019s push toward autonomous driving capabilities.\n\nWhat Happened: Gerber reported multiple disengagements over 40 miles while testing FSD version 13.2.6 on the Cybertruck, describing the system as \u201cnot usable\u201d and noting it \u201chugs the lane on the left too far over.\u201d\n\nHe directly compared Tesla\u2019s technology to Alphabet Inc.\u2018s GOOGL GOOG Waymo, stating that Tesla\u2019s FSD is \u201cnot even in the same league as Waymo at this point.\u201d\n\nGerber\u2019s comments sparked debate within the Tesla community, with some users reporting contrasting experiences.

CEO Elon Musk recently predicted that Tesla\u2019s FSD would surpass human driving safety by the second quarter of 2025. However, Tesla researcher Troy Teslike has raised concerns about the company\u2019s approach, suggesting Tesla is attempting to skip crucial development steps that competitors like Waymo spent years perfecting.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney, while acknowledging \u201cmeaningful improvement\u201d with FSD version 13, maintains a cautious stance with a Neutral rating and $345 price target on Tesla stock. Delaney projects limited initial revenue from robotaxi operations, forecasting approximately $115 million by 2027 based on a fleet of 1,500 vehicles.\n\nTesla\u2019s autonomous driving initiatives face ongoing regulatory scrutiny, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently opening investigations into 2.6 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD technology following safety concerns and reported incidents.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%) share prices tumbled as much as 8.4% following its Q4 earnings report as the market came away disappointed with the tech giant's cloud computing revenue growth rate. Like a number of other large tech companies, Alphabet is also set to ramp up its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending this year. News of Alphabet's AI-related plans was also a drag on the share price.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the internet search leader's Q4 results to see if this is a good time to buy the stock on the dip.\n\nGoogle Cloud in focus\n\nAlphabet's Google Cloud business was in focus in Q4, with the cloud computing unit growing its revenue by 30% to $12 billion. That was a deceleration in revenue growth from 35% in Q3, and the total fell short of the $12.2 billion analyst consensus estimate, as compiled by Street Account. Operating income for the unit, meanwhile, soared from $864 million to $2.09 billion, a 142% increase.\n\nThe company credited the growth to its AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions while noting that its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew faster than the overall cloud business. However, the business was capacity-constrained. As a result, it will direct approximately $75 billion to capital expenditures (capex) focused largely on technical infrastructure, including data centers and servers, to help meet increased AI demand. That's a big jump from the $52.5 billion in capex the company spent last year. However, the company said it is seeing a lot of capex efficiency and strong performance stemming from its own custom TPU (tensor processing unit) chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company expects the launch of its new Gemini 2.0 AI model to help drive growth as it moves closer to being a universal assistant. The model has more advanced multimodal and agentic capabilities and will also be used to power its AI Overviews within search. It said its consumer Gemini app is also gaining traction.\n\nTurning to Alphabet's other businesses, Google Search remained strong, with revenue climbing nearly 13% to $54 billion. It said it is seeing new ways in which people search, with its Lens solution being used for more than 20 billion visual search queries each month. It said that this is expanding the way its advertisers can reach consumers. Overall, the company was seeing the most strength among financial services provider and retailer advertisers.\n\nYouTube ad revenue, meanwhile, climbed 14% year over year to $10.5 billion. The platform's growth was fueled by users spending more time watching videos on its platform. It also said that Google AI-powered video campaigns are driving better returns for advertisers.\n\nOne area of weakness was Google's Network ad business, which saw revenue decline by 4% to $8 billion. Subscription and device revenue, meanwhile, rose 7% to $11.6 billion.\n\nLooking at Alphabet's emerging businesses, its self-driving car unit Waymo is currently delivering 150,000 paid public rides each week. It will expand its service to the new markets of Austin and Atlanta this year, as well as its first international city in Tokyo, Japan. It also said it is working on the sixth generation of its self-driving vehicle that will significantly reduce hardware costs. Alphabet also touted the progress it has made in quantum computing with its new Willow chip.\n\nOverall, Alphabet's total revenue climbed 12% year over year to $96.47 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 31% to $2.15. Analysts were expecting revenue of $96.56 billion and $2.13 in EPS, as compiled by LSEG. Alphabet reported $24.8 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $72.8 billion for the year. It ended the year with $95.7 billion in cash and equivalents and $10.9 billion in debt.\n\nIs it time to buy the dip?\n\nSimilar to rival Microsoft, investors did not like the deceleration in growth at its cloud computing unit. They also seemed a bit surprised at how much the company plans to spend on AI infrastructure capex this year. However, neither should really come as a surprise. Cloud computing growth continues to be hampered by capacity constraints industrywide, and companies will need to spend in order to add capacity.\n\nIf DeepSeek, which shook up the AI world with its claims that its model was trained for under $6 milllion can eventually prove that not as much AI infrastructure spending is needed, that would be a positive for cloud computing companies like Alphabet. However, the reliability of DeepSeek's claims is in question and until proven otherwise, cloud computing companies will need to keep spending to drive growth. Google Cloud should be in a pretty good position to leverage its spending, given that its custom TPUs should help on the cost front.\n\nDespite the market's reaction, I think Alphabet's quarter overall was solid, with both Google Search and YouTube showing their market-leading strength. Meanwhile, Google Cloud continues to drive both revenue and profitability growth.\n\nLooking at valuation, Alphabet currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 20.8x 2025 analyst estimates, making it one of the cheapest megacap tech stocks tied to AI.\n\nOverall, I think the dip in the stock is a short-term overreaction to what is a very good long-term story for Alphabet. As such, I'd be a buyer of the stock on the dip.",

            "content": "There's no denying it: Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) cloud computing business simply came up short of expectations in the fourth quarter. Investors aren't exactly thrilled with the company's intended expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), either.\n\nShareholders paid the price, in the form of a sizable sell-off following Tuesday's release of the company's fourth-quarter numbers.\n\nDon't be too rattled by the bearish response, though. A couple of important details that support the overall bullish case for the stock were obscured by all the post-earnings noise.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nFor the three months ending in December, Alphabet turned $96.5 billion in revenue into a per-share profit of $2.15. Both were up from year-ago levels and more or less in line with expectations.\n\nAll eyes were on the company's cloud business, though, which failed to satisfy. Although cloud revenue of nearly $12 billion soared 30% year over year to generate operating income of just under $2.1 billion, analysts were looking for a top-line figure of just under $12.2 billion. The small shortfall underscored the fact that Alphabet's cloud computing growth is slowing.\n\nExcept that as the chart below shows, going all the way back to early 2020, Google Cloud's top and bottom lines are maintaining the same forward progress based on the bigger picture. From a technical and mathematical perspective, the fourth quarter's cloud revenue growth is slower than the third quarter's 36% increase, but the third quarter's accelerated growth was something of an outlier.\n\nData source: Alphabet Inc. Chart by author.\n\nCompanywide, earnings barely beat expectations of $2.13 per share, while revenue was a few million bucks shy of the $96.56 billion analysts were modeling. Neither reflects Alphabet's typical strong estimate-beating form.\n\nAgain, though, a closer look at the numbers will show that except for the Google Network, all of Alphabet's core profit centers experienced robust growth in sales and operating income. It was the \"other bets\" division that accounted for most of the overall disappointment. Its revenue slipped from $657 million in the final quarter of 2023 to $400 million 12 months later, while its loss worsened from $863 million to nearly $1.2 million. Were it not for that stumble, Alphabet would have handily topped its overall estimates.\n\nThe other bets segment is where you'll find its most experimental and costliest projects, like the robotaxi Waymo, the life sciences brand Verily, and its robotics software Intrinsic. These efforts carry high risks, high costs, and high payoffs, but they don't lend themselves to consistent or predictable results.\n\nStory Continues",

Ceneo alleges it suffered losses based on Google\u2019s practice of favoring its price-comparison service in browser results over Ceneo\u2019s own service.\n\nCeneo presented the suit days after Google filed proposed remedies to the antitrust lawsuit with the Department of Justice that explained alternative actions the DOJ could take and the reasoning behind them.\n\nThe explanations focused on the sale of Chrome and why it does not fit the company\u2019s actions that the judge found to be illegal. The actions focused on exclusive contracts with browsers such as Apple, smartphone manufacturers and telecom carriers.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe DOJ suggested to the judge that Google should sell Chrome to curb its control of the search marketplace and allow rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo to have more opportunities. Google argues that the market has become crowded and there are plenty of opportunities for rivals to compete based on their performance.\n\nA Google spokesperson, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said the company disagreed with the lawsuit and was considering its options.\n\n\"Our Shopping remedy has been working successfully for several years and we continue to invest in formats that support brands, retailers and comparison shopping sites of all sizes across Poland and Europe,\" the statement read.\n\nThis is not the only suit filed against Google in Europe during the past month. Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog also reportedly accused Google of violating antitrust laws over its Chrome browser and bundling deals with smartphone makers, reported Nikkei Asia.\n\nThe Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) alleges that Google broke the country\u2019s antitrust laws over its Chrome browser. Now it could issue a cease-and-desist order. The investigation has been ongoing since October 2024.",

That comes packed with \"prioritized simplicity, elegance, and beauty,\" according to the company.\n\nOn the display front, it consists of a 6.78-inch FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and users can bump this up to 144Hz while gaming for titles like Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero.\n\nWhen it comes to the phone's cameras, it has a 50MP Sony Lytia 500 primary lens with 2x lossless zoom, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP telephoto sensor with \"built-in\" OIS (optical image stabilization). On the front, it gets a selfie camera at 32MP with a 90-degree FOV (field of view).\n\nAt the core, the Zenfone 12 Ultra comes with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, just like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. The device also comes packed with AI tools like AI Tracking for subject detection in videos, AI Portrait Video 2.0 during 4K recordings for \"precision tracking,\" and AI Voice Clarity.\n\nZenfone 12 Ultra is available in three colors: Sage Green, Ebony Black, and Sakura White. This phone is only available in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Europe at \u20ac1,099 (~$1,143).\n\nFirst look at Nothing 3a's camera\n\n(Image credit: Nothing)\n\nRead more here.\n\nNothing seems to be playing its cards right leading up to its new flagship launch that is set for March 4. This week, Nothing posted an official teaser image of the side of the Phone 3a that was glowing white. The only tagline by the company reads, \"Your second memory, one click away.\"\n\nThis left many speculating on X if Nothing has teased a physical camera button for the Phone 3a \u2014 much like what we get to see in the iPhone 16 series. This would let users place the phone in landscape or portrait mode and press the side-mounted button instead of tapping the display.\n\nIf this were true, Nothing's Phone 3a would likely be the first ever Android phone to feature a camera button that could potentially allow users to control and swap between camera modes by slowly swiping along the button or pressing to snap a photo.\n\nHuawei leaps on the multi-fold game\n\n(Image credit: Huawei)\n\nRead more here.\n\nRecently, Huawei posted an \"innovative product launch\" teaser on X, which left people to wonder if the company's first multi-fold phone is arriving in global markets outside of China. The Chinese OEM said, \"Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate.\" The final part, \"the ultimate,\" seemingly refers to the Mate XT, also known as the Mate XT Ultimate Design.\n\nAdditionally, the post features a teaser image that looks like the Z-Shape. Aside from users speculating it could be the Mate XT in its X thread, the company has only responded with \"Stay tuned!\"\n\nIn September 2024, Huawei launched the world's first multi-fold phone, which, when fully unfolded, the device features a tablet-like 10.2-inch display. The interesting thing about this phone is that users can use it in different \"modes\" or \"states.\" Using a singular screen will give you a phone-style 6.4-inch OLED display while unfolding an additional screen provides a 7.9-inch experience.\n\nAt its maximum, the Mate XT is said to utilize the company's \"golden ratio\" of 16:11 in 3K resolution.\n\nMeta's chase for the Metaverse\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nRead more here.\n\nMeta's Andrew Bosworth says 2025 is the 'make-or-break' year for the Metaverse. In a leaked internal memo, Bosworth hinted at the Reality Labs\u2019 work in mixed reality will either be game-changing or a potential \"legendary misadventure.\"\n\nBosworth adds that Meta is sticking with the metaverse, including Horizon Worlds, through 2025, although the company will have to \"need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR.\" Reality Labs, Meta's VR division, has taken several billions in funding, but it hasn't yet lived up to its word of making it big in the VR world. Reality Labs also added nearly $5 billion in losses last quarter,\n\nIn other news, Meta's VP of VR and mixed reality (MR) has quit the company. Mark Rabkin has had the title of VP of VR/MR since the Oculus Quest 2 launched in 2020.\n\nIn a letter shared on Facebook, Rabkin describes his time at Meta as a \"foundational, formative experience.\" Rabkin said he's leaving due to family health struggles at home, noting that he'll be taking some time off work rather before moving to a different position inside the company.\n\nRabkin has worked on many major projects from the ground up, like the Meta Quest headsets, over the past six years, including the transition from Oculus to Meta branding, creating record revenues of over 1 billion dollars last quarter alone. And played a major role in the Meta Quest 3S launch. According to Rabkin, Ryan Cairns, who formerly led Portal and Meta for Work initiatives, will now be filling his shows. Cairns is expected to assume the full title of VP of VR/MR at the beginning of March and will report to Vishal Shah, who will remain VP of Metaverse.\n\nMore stories this week\n\nThose are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Recently, the tech giant reported a fourth-quarter revenue of $96.5 billion, with a per-share profit that edged out expectations at $2.15. However, the cloud division\u2019s performance fell slightly short, drawing the ire of investors and prompting a sell-off.\n\nYet, let\u2019s peel back the layers. Despite the cloud revenue of nearly $12 billion showing a 30% year-over-year increase, it barely missed the analyst target. While many see this as a setback, the broader trend reveals consistent forward movement in Google Cloud\u2019s growth since early 2020\u2014a detail lost in the chaos.\n\nThe \u201cother bets\u201d segment, which houses ambitious projects like Waymo and Verily, did stumble, reflecting its high-risk nature. But don\u2019t be fooled. Alphabet\u2019s profit margins remain impressive at 32.1%, and its revenue continues to soar higher than ever.\n\nDespite the recent sell-off, Alphabet is still a titan, handling around 90% of global web searches. Industry projections suggest the cloud computing and AI markets could explode in growth\u2014over 20% and 45% annually, respectively\u2014paving the way for Alphabet to further capitalize on massive opportunities ahead.\n\nSo, rather than joining the panic, consider this: the current dip might just be the perfect entry point for long-term gains. Don\u2019t overlook Alphabet\u2019s underlying strength\u2014this tech giant is poised for a brighter day ahead!\n\nUncovering Alphabet\u2019s Hidden Opportunities: Insights You Can\u2019t Miss!\n\nIn light of Alphabet\u2019s recent financial performance and market dynamics, several emerging insights and relevant details can shine a light on the company\u2019s positioning and potential trajectory. The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and understanding the intricacies can help investors make informed decisions.\n\nKey Insights and Trends\n\n1. Market Growth Forecasts:\n\n\u2013 The global cloud computing market is expected to grow at an annual rate exceeding 20% through the upcoming years. Similarly, the artificial intelligence sector is projected to explode at a staggering rate of 45% annually. As a leader in cloud services and AI, Alphabet is uniquely positioned to leverage these trends.\n\n2. Innovations within Alphabet:\n\n\u2013 Alphabet is investing heavily in AI innovations, particularly in machine learning and automation. These efforts not only enhance its advertising capabilities but also improve efficiency and customer engagement across platforms. Recently introduced AI features in Google Workspace demonstrate a commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology in daily tools for users.\n\n3. Sustainability Initiatives:\n\n\u2013 Alphabet has committed to sustainability with its goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. This initiative enhances its brand reputation and aligns with global environmental goals, which is increasingly important to consumers and investors.\n\nImportant Questions\n\n1. What are the factors driving Alphabet\u2019s cloud growth despite recent setbacks?\n\n\u2013 The cloud division has seen consistent improvements year-over-year, fueled by an increase in enterprise adoption and a surge in demand for scalable solutions. The integration of advanced technologies like AI into cloud offerings further enhances its appeal, as businesses seek to modernize their operations.\n\n2. How might Alphabet\u2019s \u201cother bets\u201d influence long-term growth?\n\n\u2013 While projects like Waymo and Verily have had mixed results, their long-term potential could be significant. If successful, these ventures could diversify revenue streams beyond advertising. Moreover, investors should view these projects as part of Alphabet\u2019s strategy to lead in future tech sectors.\n\n3. What are the implications of Alphabet\u2019s profit margins for investor confidence?\n\n\u2013 With impressive profit margins of 32.1%, Alphabet demonstrates robust financial health, which can reassure investors. High margins indicate effective cost management and operational efficiency, essential for sustaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market.\n\nComparisons to Competitors\n\n\u2013 When compared to other tech giants, Alphabet\u2019s integration of AI within its cloud products sets it apart. Companies like AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft Azure are fierce competitors, but Alphabet\u2019s focus on innovation and user-friendly solutions may offer distinctive advantages.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite short-term volatility, Alphabet\u2019s foundational strengths, ongoing investments in high-growth areas, and commitment to sustainability position the company well for future opportunities. Savvy investors should keep a vigilant eye on Alphabet\u2019s evolution as the tech landscape continues to mature.\n\nFor more insights, visit Alphabet\u2019s Official Page.",

            "content": "Too many investors are looking right past a couple of obscured bullish details regarding the company's future.\n\nThere's no denying it: Alphabet's (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) cloud computing business simply came up short of expectations in the fourth quarter. Investors aren't exactly thrilled with the company's intended expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), either.\n\nShareholders paid the price, in the form of a sizable sell-off following Tuesday's release of the company's fourth-quarter numbers.\n\nDon't be too rattled by the bearish response, though. A couple of important details that support the overall bullish case for the stock were obscured by all the post-earnings noise.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nFor the three months ending in December, Alphabet turned $96.5 billion in revenue into a per-share profit of $2.15. Both were up from year-ago levels and more or less in line with expectations.\n\nAll eyes were on the company's cloud business, though, which failed to satisfy. Although cloud revenue of nearly $12 billion soared 30% year over year to generate operating income of just under $2.1 billion, analysts were looking for a top-line figure of just under $12.2 billion. The small shortfall underscored the fact that Alphabet's cloud computing growth is slowing.\n\nExcept that as the chart below shows, going all the way back to early 2020, Google Cloud's top and bottom lines are maintaining the same forward progress based on the bigger picture. From a technical and mathematical perspective, the fourth quarter's cloud revenue growth is slower than the third quarter's 36% increase, but the third quarter's accelerated growth was something of an outlier.\n\nCompanywide, earnings barely beat expectations of $2.13 per share, while revenue was a few million bucks shy of the $96.56 billion analysts were modeling. Neither reflects Alphabet's typical strong estimate-beating form.\n\nAgain, though, a closer look at the numbers will show that except for the Google Network, all of Alphabet's core profit centers experienced robust growth in sales and operating income. It was the \"other bets\" division that accounted for most of the overall disappointment. Its revenue slipped from $657 million in the final quarter of 2023 to $400 million 12 months later, while its loss worsened from $863 million to nearly $1.2 million. Were it not for that stumble, Alphabet would have handily topped its overall estimates.\n\nThe other bets segment is where you'll find its most experimental and costliest projects, like the robotaxi Waymo, the life sciences brand Verily, and its robotics software Intrinsic. These efforts carry high risks, high costs, and high payoffs, but they don't lend themselves to consistent or predictable results.\n\nEven so, despite the company's cloud computing business' reported headwind and other bets' rough quarter, Alphabet has never generated more revenue or produced more profit than right now. Its profit margins are also still about as strong as they've ever been, at 32.1% of revenue.\n\nOpportunity knocks\n\nSo why was there a sell-off on Wednesday?\n\nThe dour headlines about Alphabet's cloud business understandably rattled the market, particularly given that most of the reporting failed to offer the context that the two charts above provide.\n\nThat being said, it's also not a stretch to suggest the stock was vulnerable to a post-earnings sell-off no matter what management said Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Justice Department is pressuring Alphabet to sell its Chrome browser, undermining one of the key ways it connects consumers to its search engine. And it's fighting a brutal legal battle with the European Union to undo a multibillion-dollar antitrust fine levied against its Android operating system installed on most of the world's mobile devices.\n\nGiven this backdrop, it's surprising this stock was able to climb to a record high headed into Tuesday evening's release of its fourth-quarter results. Conversely, it's not surprising this fragile rally ended up being so vulnerable to even modestly concerning numbers.\n\nInvestors don't exactly seem thrilled that the company plans to spend another $75 billion on AI data centers this year (29% more than expected) rather than seeing this spending at least begin to level off.\n\nRagardless, don't be too quick to come to any sweeping conclusions. This ticker was already in an unusual position headed into Tuesday's report. Then there were the couple of curveballs from the financial media that lacked the proper context: the fact that Alphabet's most important businesses are still growing quite well, while its newer ventures like AI remain promising.\n\nMore to the point, even if the recent selling has yet to run its full course, Wednesday's setback is a long-term buying opportunity.\n\nEven without Chrome, Alphabet is likely to remain the centerpiece of most peoples' digital connection to the world. Its Google search engine still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, according to GlobalStats.\n\nAnd Goldman Sachs believes the worldwide cloud computing industry is poised to grow at an average annual pace of more than 20% through 2030, while market researcher Technavio predicts the global AI platform market will expand at an annualized pace of 45% through 2028.\n\nSo there's plenty of opportunity ahead for Alphabet to tap into. Last quarter (and in particular the commentary regarding last quarter) isn't an accurate representation of this company's potential. This dip is a buying opportunity for interested investors.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nVerily, the life sciences arm of technology giant Alphabet, has reached a deal to sell its insurance subsidiary to Elevance, the payer confirmed to Healthcare Dive on Friday.\n\nThe subsidiary, called Granular Insurance Company, provides stop-loss insurance for employers meant to protect them from catastrophically high medical costs.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nVerily, one of Google\u2019s sister companies under Alphabet, launched Granular in 2020. The company, then called Coefficient Insurance Company, offers self-funded employers stop-loss insurance, along with reinsurance and other data-driven risk management products.\n\nA spokesperson for Elevance declined to comment on why Granular is an attractive acquisition for the company. But the deal signals that Elevance wants to build out its commercial products, potentially as a hedge against volatility in government programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which have seen margins plummet since the pandemic.\n\nCurrently, Elevance has 24.3 million members in employer plans (not counting BlueCard arrangements) \u2014 a little under half of its overall membership.\n\nDemand for stop-loss products is also expected to increase as medical costs do, especially in pricey areas like specialty drugs.\n\nStop-loss insurance shelters employers from unexpectedly sharp increases in medical spending by reimbursing them above a certain amount. It\u2019s generally used by self-funded companies that assume financial risk for their workers\u2019 medical care.\n\nStop-loss can either be a very good or very bad thing for its issuer depending on how costs plan out. For example Cigna, one of the largest commercial insurers in the U.S, saw its insurance operating income plummet 47% year over year in the fourth quarter after it was hit with unexpectedly high stop-loss costs.\n\nAlphabet does not report the finances of non-core \u201cother bets\u201d like Granular. However, the Granular\u2019s has increased significantly in past years, according to reporting from The Information. The insurer brought in $201.3 million in revenue in 2022, per its Pitchbook profile.\n\nVerily is offloading Granular in its latest operational restructuring as the business continues work to find its niche in healthcare. Various focuses for Verily in the past few years include continuous glucose monitoring, coronavirus pandemic response and, most recently, precision medicine.",

That stake would be worth $21.17 million based on the current price of SNOW stock.\n\nThe sale ends a multi-year investment that Alphabet held in Snowflake. The online search giant first disclosed a stake of 535,604 SNOW shares in the first quarter of 2022. Google LLC held that stake steady until the third quarter of 2024 when it sold 421,050 shares of Snowflake to cut its holdings to 114,554 shares. It has now completely exited the position.\n\nStruggling Stock\n\nAlphabet hasn\u2019t discussed its investment in Snowflake publicly or commented on why it sold its stake in the cloud company. Google and Snowflake have an existing partnership which looks to be ongoing. However, Alphabet may have sold its SNOW stock due to poor performance. Since going public in a highly-anticipated IPO back in 2020, Snowflake\u2019s share price has declined 23%.\n\nSnowflake has struggled with poor financial results and underwhelming guidance. The company\u2019s CEO Frank Slootman announced his retirement last year. A much discussed boost from an artificial-intelligence (AI) shift to software from hardware has yet to materialize at the company.\n\nAlphabet wasn\u2019t the only high-profile investor in Snowflake.

While ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of financial data, market news, and historical trends, their ability to consistently outperform human experts or quantitative models remains debatable. Instead, investors should look towards AI-driven hedge funds, such as Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma, that have historically outperformed the market using machine learning models. For example, the Medallion Fund of the former achieved an annualized return of 66% before fees from 1988 to 2018. These funds rely on proprietary algorithms, high-frequency trading, and massive datasets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOne indicator of hedge funds being ahead of the curve when it comes to stocks and the broader market in general is a recent Goldman Sachs note to investors which details that top hedge funds navigated the recent tech selloff without significant losses, even managing to post nominal gains since the turn of the year despite a big dropoff in the market amid concerns over trade tariffs and an AI bubble. Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThe stocks listed below were mentioned in articles by prominent finance publications as some of the best ChatGPT stock picks over the past six months.

Recent filings from Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet (GOOGL) all omitted or changed DEI references previously included in prior yearly reports. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) remain firm on those goals\u2014for now.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

See all of our newsletters\n\nLike much of the tech industry, the three companies in 2020 introduced various diversity pledges in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and widespread protests for racial justice. Alongside other commitments, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet set targets to boost company leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30 percent by 2025.\n\nThe shift comes as Big Tech cozies up to the Trump Administration, which has introduced several executive orders aimed at dismantling DEI practices across the federal government. Here\u2019s a look at how Big Tech\u2019s annual filings reflect an industry-wide pushback on DEI:\n\nAlphabet scraps diversity hiring targets\n\nEarlier this week, Alphabet\u2019s annual report omitted a line seen in previous yearly filings that reiterated the Google parent company\u2019s commitment to \u201cmaking diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s language was updated to reflect that Alphabet has spent the past year \u201creviewing our programs\u201d on equal opportunities, said the company in a statement, adding that it is \u201cevaluating changes required\u201d after a slew of court decisions and executive orders from Trump that targeted DEI. On Feb. 5, the same day it released its annual report, Alphabet reportedly told employees that it will halt hiring targets aimed at improving the representation of underrepresented groups.\n\nAmazon winds down \u201coutdated DEI programs\u201d\n\nAmazon, too, has amended its 2024 company report. Previous filings stated, \u201cAs we strive to be Earth\u2019s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety and engagement to hire and develop the best talent\u201d\u2014a line missing from its newest report. The company\u2019s latest annual report, filed on Feb. 2, also changed a sentence on hiring and evaluation mechanisms that previously mentioned a desire to \u201cpromote equity for all candidates and employees.\u201d\n\nThe company cut back its DEI programs in December, telling staffers in an internal memo that \u201coutdated programs and materials\u201d would be winded down.\n\nMeta dismantles its DEI team\n\nIn 2020, Meta began including a section detailing its diversity efforts in annual reports. Titled \u201cDiversity and Inclusion,\u201d \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d and \u201cDiverse and Inclusive Workplace\u201d over the years, the section was renamed as \u201cThe Strength of Our Workforce and People Processes\u201d in 2024 and omitted the company\u2019s usual updates on data regarding workplace diversity.\n\nThe latest annual report, filed on Jan. 30, noted that Meta has since \u201cannounced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape.\u201d Last month, the company told employees it was dismantling its DEI team and eliminating several DEI programs that included supplier diversity efforts and representation goals for women and minorities.\n\nMicrosoft sticks to its DEI commitments\n\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t make any notable changes to its comments on DEI efforts during its most recent annual report, filed at the end of Microsoft\u2019s fiscal 2024 in June. Echoing previous years\u2019 filings, the company noted it aims \u201cto recruit, develop and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds\u201d and stated that \u201cdiversity and inclusion are core to our business.\u201d\n\nThe company doubled down on these commitments in October with the release of its 2024 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report. \u201cBy actively seeking diversity and embracing inclusion, we ensure our workforce represents the planet we serve, and that the products we build always meet our customers\u2019 needs,\u201d said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in the report. Microsoft confirmed to Observer that it has nothing new to share regarding its DEI efforts.\n\nApple defends its DEI policies amid pressure\n\nApple also retained the company\u2019s traditional diversity and inclusion section in its latest annual report, filed in November. \u201cThe company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves,\u201d said Apple in its 2024 annual report.\n\nThe company defended its DEI policies last month after the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, called on Apple to cease such efforts. In a January disclosure to investors, the iPhone maker urged investors to vote against the proposal. \u201cWe strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\u201d said the company in a proxy filing that described the proposal as \u201cunnecessary\u201d given Apple\u2019s \u201cwell-established compliance program.\u201d",

            "content": "Oklahoma is poised to become the first Republican state to try to use its influence as an investor to end DEI in corporate America, targeting companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in shareholder proxy proposals.\n\nUsing an increasingly popular tactic among conservative investors who are going after everything from Wall Street banks to health-care giants, Oklahoma Treasurer Todd Russ is planning to confront six companies that the state invests in through its $2 billion Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust. The other companies are Netflix Inc., Lululemon Athletica Inc., GoDaddy Inc. and Yum! Brands Inc.\n\nRuss is calling for \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d in the companies\u2019 policies and partnerships, including challenging \u201cradical\u201d political giving and donations to organizations such as Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. He\u2019s also seeking equal treatment for religious employee groups in the workplace.\n\nAlthough anti-DEI shareholder proposals have historically received only about 2% investor support, the move is designed to raise visibility and combat the power of progressive funds from California and New York, which for years have pushed businesses on everything from disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions to undergoing racial-equity audits.\n\nThe conservative assault against DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) has gathered renewed strength in recent weeks as President Donald Trump sets about keeping his campaign promise to dismantle DEI in the federal government and American companies.\n\nMore than 30 companies are facing shareholder resolutions on DEI issues this year thanks to proposals from groups including the National Center for Public Policy Research, Alliance Defending Freedom and the Heritage Foundation. The proposals are non-binding, but resolutions that receive at least 30% support can often inspire changes in corporate behavior.\n\n\u201cThe fiduciary obligation of a publicly traded company is to maximize their earnings for their shareholders,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Russ said in an interview. When boards \u201cdouble down on things like DEI, and that ends up in the boardroom, they muddy the waters on real fiduciary obligations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Oklahoma fund owns less than 1% of each of the stocks, with its holding totaling about $31 million across the six companies, a spokesperson for the state said. A shareholder needs to own at least $2,000 of shares in a company for three years to be able to bring a resolution, according to Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon.com declined to comment. The company already halted some of its diversity and inclusion programs as part of a review of hundreds of initiatives.\n\nRepresentatives for Google parent Alphabet, Netflix, Lululemon, Yum! and GoDaddy didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nThe rise in anti-DEI shareholder resolutions doesn\u2019t mean that they will get any closer to passing, said Michael Passoff, founder and CEO of Proxy Impact, which works with investors supporting environmental, social and governance issues, including DEI.\n\nHe said the proposals often fail because they lack a financial argument. \u201cMany of the resolutions that are filed by these groups are more about their values or viewpoints than the financial materiality of what they\u2019re asking,\u201d Passoff said.\n\nPhoto: An Amazon Fulfillment center.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. shares have largely climbed on the back of two trends: strength in its cloud business and a focus on costs. Now both could be in question.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDisappointing results from major cloud-computing companies Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. suggest reasons to be cautious about Amazon Web Services, the biggest player in the space \u2014 and a central plank in Wall Street\u2019s nearly unanimously positive view on the stock. At the same time, a trend of growing capital expenditures as firms invest heavily in artificial intelligence could, if Amazon follows suit, force a recalibration of how profitable it can be this year.\n\nThe performance of AWS and the company\u2019s spending plans will likely be a main focus of Amazon\u2019s results, due after the market close. Shares hit a record earlier this week, and have risen nearly 50% off an August low. The stock gained 1.2% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf the trend of relative cloud weakness is real, as it appears to be, we could see shares move lower if AWS disappoints,\u201d said Dan Genter, who oversees about $8 billion as chief executive officer of Genter Capital Management. \u201cWe want to see margin improvement, and if we don\u2019t see continued revenue growth, we will be entirely dependent on cost cutting for that at a time when companies are spending a lot more.\u201d\n\nCloud computing is seen as a part of software where AI will emerge early as a tailwind to growth, but the latest reads have undercut the timing of when that might occur. Results from Alphabet featured weaker-than-expected cloud revenue, following in the footsteps of Microsoft, which last week gave a similarly mixed read on its own cloud business, although that in part reflected supply constraints amid high demand.\n\nThe lack of pronounced growth inflections has investors growing impatient about when the billions of dollars invested in AI infrastructure will pay off. While there remains a lot of long-term optimism that it will over the long term, some have balked at the heavy spending.\n\n\u201cCapex is starting to feel like the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and there\u2019s some fatigue at all this spending,\u201d said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. \u201cRight now its almost less about when the AI spending will be monetized, and more about whether it can be legitimized.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

The Granular sale is the latest in a series of sweeping changes at the precision health company, which has slashed its workforce, restructured its business and overhauled its executive leadership in recent years.\n\nThe terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nVerily launched Granular, initially called Coefficient Insurance Company, in 2020 with financial backing from the commercial insurance unit of the Swiss Re Group. The business offered self-funded employers and captives medical stop-loss, fronting reinsurance and fronting solutions that used \"proprietary technology,\" Verily said.\n\nAlphabet's health company has raised more than $1 billion, and it has attracted big-name talent. Apple's former head of health strategic initiatives, Myoung Cha, joined Verily as chief product officer last year, and Andrew Trister, Verily's chief medical and scientific officer, was a founding member of Apple's health team. Amy Abernethy, who served as principal deputy commissioner at the U.S. Food and Drug administration, joined the company in 2021 before departing in late 2023.\n\nBut Verily has struggled to find and stick to a winning niche in health care.\n\nThe company started as a moonshot in 2015 within Alphabet's innovation lab X, formerly Google X, where it developed hardware like continuous glucose monitors. Verily pivoted to pandemic response when Covid-19 broke out in 2020, and it switched directions again to focus on precision medicine in 2022.\n\nVerily introduced a new artificial intelligence-powered chronic care solution in June called Lightpath.

The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google's subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products such as Chromecast). Google's cloud computing platform, or GCP, accounts for roughly 10% of Alphabet's revenue with the firm's investments in up-and-coming technologies such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber) making up the rest.\n\nIn light of the recent options history for Alphabet, it's now appropriate to focus on the company itself. We aim to explore its current performance.\n\nAlphabet's Current Market Status\n\nCurrently trading with a volume of 2,047,975, the GOOGL's price is down by -0.79%, now at $189.82.\n\nRSI readings suggest the stock is currently is currently neutral between overbought and oversold.\n\nAnticipated earnings release is in 77 days.\n\nUnusual Options Activity Detected: Smart Money on the Move\n\nBenzinga Edge's Unusual Options board spots potential market movers before they happen.

Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland -- Senior Director, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.\n\nSome of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors.\n\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\n\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full stack approach. We are making dramatic progress across compute model capabilities and in driving efficiencies. We are rapidly shipping product improvements and seeing terrific momentum with consumer and developer usage.\n\nAnd we are pushing the next frontiers from AI agents, reasoning and deep research to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing and more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results. In Search, AI Overviews are now available in more than 100 countries.\n\nThey continue to drive higher satisfaction and Search usage. Meanwhile, Circle to Search is now available on over 200 million Android devices. In cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion.\n\nWe are set up well for continued growth. So, today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll touch on cloud, YouTube platforms and devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI.\n\nLast quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation. Our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. First, AI infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue.\n\nWe have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level from training and serving to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects strengthening global connectivity.\n\nOur leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly four times more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just five years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer are why organizations increasingly choose Google Cloud's platform. In fact, today, Cloud customers consume more than eight times the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago.\n\nWe'll continue to invest in our Cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, world-class research, including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance.\n\nFlash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow, we are making 2.0 Flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. So, stay tuned. Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash thinking model. The progress to scale thinking has been super fast and the review so far have been extremely positive.\n\nWe are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon. Gemini 2.0's advances in multimodality and native tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is deep research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf and give key findings along with sources.\n\nIt launched in Gemini Advanced in December and is rolling out to Android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on iOS last November. And we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks; and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year.\n\nWe are also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models. Vo2, our state-of-the-art video generation model and Imagen 3, our highest-quality text to image model. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leaderboards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just six months ago.\n\nAnd we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more cubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough.\n\nThird, our products and platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world. We have seven products and platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search where Gemini is powering our AI Overviews. People use Search more with AI Overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions.\n\nThis behavior is even more pronounced with younger users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We are also pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional search use and opening up even more types of questions. Thise feature is popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches.\n\nAs AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet. Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube platforms and devices and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Mercado Libre, and Servier.\n\nIn 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than double compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our cloud marketplace.\n\nWe continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered cloud solutions. It begins with our AI hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost across both GPUs and TPUs. These advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by nearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers four times better training performance and three times greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation.\n\nWe also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H100-based platforms to customers. And just last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a 5x increase in customers year over year, with brands like Mondelez International and WPP building new applications and benefiting from our 200-plus foundation models.\n\nVertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo. We're also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases data analytics and cybersecurity platforms. Customers, including Radisson Hotels, are now using Gemini to search and analyze multimodal data from across multiple clouds. Our AI-powered threat intelligence and security operations products help customers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect, and defend against threats.\n\nOur growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agent Space, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google Quality Search create Gemini-powered agents and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace business and enterprise customers access to all of our powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube.\n\nNeeds and data shows YouTube continues to be No. 1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the U.S., watched election-related content on YouTube.\n\nOur early investment in Podcast is paying off. We integrated Podcast into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcast in the U.S. according to a recent Edison report.\n\nThis success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube shopping affiliate program in the U.S. and Korea alone. We expand YouTube with shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries allowing even more creators to share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses.\n\nPhilip will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, platforms and devices. Google One's performance has been outstanding and is one of our fastest-growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series.\n\nWe also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm. Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended reality devices like headsets and classes. Finally, a few words on Waymo, which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips.\n\nIt's now averaging over 150,000 trips each week and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year, and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We are also developing the sixth-generation Waymo driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs.\n\nI want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting, and we are all ready for it. Philipp, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube, and partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google services revenues were $84 billion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.\n\nIn terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on U.S. election advertising with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. Now, in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search.\n\nWe had lots of exciting updates in December, and we are rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera or in ways that were not possible before, like was Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers.\n\nGoogle is already present in over half of Journeys where a new brand product or retailer are discovered. By offering new ways for people to search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and using Lens quickly find information about the product, reviews similar products and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month and the majority of these searches are incremental.\n\nRetail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the U.S. holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated. People shop more than 1 billion times a day across Google.\n\nLast quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users in Google shopping in the U.S., compared to the same period in 2023. Closing out on Search with Travel and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to Travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for Travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday.\n\nMoving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative and measurement. As I've said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. And over the past quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing the use of AI.\n\nAs an example, Petco used demand gen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click-through rate than their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube Select Creator takeovers generally available in the U.S. and will be expanding to more markets this year.\n\nCreators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. Looking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMax, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best-performing assets. Using asset generation in PMax, Event Ticket Center achieved a five times increase in production of creative assets saving time and effort. They also increased conversions by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets.\n\nAnd finally, measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for customers, helping more business reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube delivered 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns. Turning to YouTube.\n\nWe saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth in watch time across ad-supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Vo2, which creates incredibly high-quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with it.\n\nWe'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months. We continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally cannot promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types and Google Ads, and creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used demand gen Shorts-only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the holiday gift guide campaign and leverage greater collaborations to find the best gift.\n\nThis drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora holiday. Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long-form. In 2024, the monetization rate of short relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the U.S., and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens.\n\nWe're particularly excited by its success on Connected TV, which now makes up 15% of Shorts viewing in the U.S. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton eached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their Shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent video lengths, while the long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and Millennials. Looking into the Living Room.\n\nWe continue to be No. 1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for nearly two years according to Nielsen. And our share of streaming is at a record high.\n\nViewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multiyear investments to tap into shifting consumer behavior. The current search and Living Room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in.\n\nIn fact, the number of creators making a majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year on year. We have also invested in podcast, where popular shows like Shay, Shay and Lex Fridman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over $400 million of podcast each month on living room devices alone.\n\nYouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the U.S. according to Edison. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships with the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung.\n\nAnother expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citi's generate AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.\n\nAnat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Philipp. We're pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing across the business as Alphabet revenue for 2024 reached $350 billion, up 14% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency versus 2023. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results.\n\nI'll end with some commentary and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth followed by Cloud.\n\nTotal cost of revenue was $40.6 billion, up 8%. TAC was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels while network revenues, which have a much higher tax rate declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure.\n\nGrowth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our Made by Google launches to the third quarter 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenue and opex based on associated head count. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion.\n\nR&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office space optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31% this quarter to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion.\n\nNet income increased 28%, to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results.\n\nGoogle service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search and YouTube Ads. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand followed by direct response advertising.\n\nNetwork advertising revenue of $8 billion were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our Made by Google devices to the third quarter compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One.\n\nWith regards to platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google Service operating income increased 23%, to $32.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP, across core GCP products, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions.\n\nOnce again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%. We're pleased with the work the cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to customer and generate revenue growth as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the cloud business.\n\nAs for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenue were $400 million, the operating loss was $1.2 billion. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect a milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the Other Bets. Turning to Alphabet level activities. The largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet.\n\nAs a reminder, Alphabet-level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce and office space charges. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization. With respect to capex, our reported capex in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion in share repurchases, and $2.4 billion in dividend payments.\n\nOverall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenue across the company. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates.\n\nAt the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025, compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAs for our segments, Google Services advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experienced in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. And in Cloud, given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for capex for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers followed by data centers and networking.\n\nWe expect to invest approximately $75 billion in capex in 2025, with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of that in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in capex over the past few years will increase pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service.\n\nGiven the increase in capex investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate in 2025. Second, we expect some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customer at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business.\n\nBefore we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14%, or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-digit revenue growth, coupled with margin expansion. YouTube and cloud revenues combined ended the year at $110 billion annual run rate.\n\nAnd in 2024, we generated total income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to improve the performance of our Ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential through new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization.\n\nAnd I look forward to sharing more on our progress throughout the year. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Sundar, one for Anat. Sundar, maybe kind of step back on search, there's a seems like there's a lot of advances to come with Gen AI and agenetic possibilities with Search. Can you just sort of walk us through your big-picture vision over the next few years of how you think about your search product continue to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and monetization for your users and advertisers? Then the second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies in areas of simplification on the opex base.\n\nCan you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the potential for further efficiencies to the opex base, excluding the D&A step-ups that we have to come in 2025? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Brian. On Search, obviously, we view -- I mean, this has been a long continuity journey. AI Overviews has been the next step. It's playing out positively as we have indicated.\n\nThe metrics look great and we are obviously trading on their experience, bringing better and better models, expanding to the number of queries where it works, and so on. But there's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways, in multimodal ways. Things like what we have done with Lens, Circle to Search, you can imagine the future with Project Astra.\n\nYou can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work. Things which don't always get answered instantaneously but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of explorations, and you will see us putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025. And so, I do feel the opportunity space with AI.\n\nThere's a lot of unlock ahead.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd for the question with regards to where do we see, or where do I see leverage moving forward and some of the comments I've made on the previous call? I certainly see opportunities for further productivity and efficiency, and this is one of our priority areas. And we're going to do that so that we can make sure we continue to invest in areas such as AI and Cloud where we see potential for continued growth. I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which include the technical infrastructure. So, the $75 billion in capex I mentioned for this year, the majority of that is going to go toward our technical infrastructure, which includes servers and data centers.\n\nSo, ensuring we do that in the most efficient way is critical. Second is managing head count growth, and we're going to be investing in areas of growth, such as AI and Cloud, but looking across the organization and moderating that growth will be important. Optimizing the real estate footprint is one of the areas I've mentioned, we're continuing to focus on that. As well as looking at how we simplify the organization.\n\nWe previously mentioned bringing like areas together. Sundar talked about bringing some of the research teams together so that we can operate with increased speed, but also how we operate within the organization, using our own AI tools to how you run the business. Whether it's the code that Sundar mentioned on the previous call, writing code with AI or even running some of our key processes using AI tools. So, we're looking at all that.\n\nIt's going to -- this is not a 1-quarter type of effort. It's going to continue throughout the year, and we're going to continue to focus on that so that we can support the growth in other areas.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Philip and one for Anat. Philipp, can you just talk more about the expanded rollout of ads on AI Overviews and perhaps what additional things you may have learned in 4Q? And I guess, in particular, just curious if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries. And is it still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing Search? And then, Anat, just on the on Cloud growth.\n\nA little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded like you also suggested that you were capacity-constrained in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to push on that a little bit more how -- is that accurate? And is it fair to say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer\n\nSo, on your first question, first of all, AI Overviews, which is really nice to see, continue to drive higher satisfaction and search usage, so that's really good. And as you know, we recently launched the ads within AI Overviews on mobile in the U.S., which builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below. And as I talked about before, for the AI Overviews, overall, we actually see monetization at approximately the same rate, which I think really gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nOn the Cloud question, so first, I'm excited that we ended the quarter at $12 billion and a 30% year-over-year growth, very impressive growth. And as I mentioned in the prepared remark, GCP grew at a much higher rate than overall Cloud. Two items to think about from a deceleration perspective. The first is we are lapping a very strong quarter in AI deployment in Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe second is the one you've alluded to, we do see and have been seeing very strong demand for our AI products in the fourth quarter in 2024. And we exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. So, we are in a tight supply demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online. As I mentioned, we've increased investment in capex in 2024, continue to increase in 2025, and we'll bring more capacity throughout the year.\n\nDoug Anmuth -- Analyst\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking the question. I'll just ask one. Sundar with the news that came out of China a little over two weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI, as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer, or from training to inference and maybe even custom silicon becomes more dominant across the team. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news a couple of weeks ago and what it might mean for Alphabet longer term.\n\nThank you.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Eric. Look, I think there's been a lot of observations on DeepSeek. First of all, I think a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work.\n\nLook, I think for us, it's always been obvious over time. There's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well. And if you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shines is the Pareto frontier of cost performance in latency. And if you look at all three attributes, I think we are -- we lead this period of frontier.\n\nAnd I would say both our 2.0 Flash models, our 2.0 Flash thinking models, they are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full stack development end-to-end optimization, our obsession with cost per query. All of that, I think, sets as well for the workloads had both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side. A couple of things I would say are if you look at the trajectory over the past three years, the proportion of the spend toward inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because, obviously, inferences to support businesses with good ROIC.\n\nAnd so, I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference dimension as well. And so, I think -- look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is, we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space.\n\nIt's as big as it comes, and that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment.\n\nEric Sheridan -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson -- Analyst\n\nThank you. I have two, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, question for you is we're starting to see more AI tools on e-commerce sites and something like research with AI recommendations is on Google shopping. Can you talk about how that product and other AI tools are impacting shopping behavior, have that impact to monetization? And then I guess the $75 billion question Anat is, how do you think about long-term capital intensity for this business? It sounds like there's a bit of constraint in terms of getting things built.\n\nBut how do you think or how do you think about the modeling of capital intensity going forward? And what are the things that you're looking forward to in terms of whether or not this is the right level of spend? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer\n\nLook, excellent question. We've been using our advances in AI to make search for products on Google even easier, obviously. And in Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google shopping experience, which we rebuilt from the ground up with AI. And people shop more than a billion times a day across Google.\n\nLast quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented Google shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly -- I mentioned as 13% more daily active users in Google Shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period last year. So, that's a good development here.\n\nAnd the new Google Shopping experiences specifically to your question, users to really intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search plus maybe products that meet your needs. So, shoppers very often want low prices. So, the new page not only includes like deal-finding tools like price comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout.\n\nBut it's also a new and dedicated personalized deals page, which can browse deals for you, and all this is really built on the backbone of AI. So, we think this is a very interesting opportunity.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd on the question of capital expenditure -- and I think you may have two questions in there. One is just the capital intensity and then how would we think about return on that invested capital? So, on the first one, certainly, we're looking ahead, but we're managing very responsibly. It was a very rigorous, even internal governance process, looking at how do we allocate the capacity and what would we need to support the customer demand externally, but also across the Google -- the Alphabet business. And as you've seen in the comment I've just made on Cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available capacity.\n\nSo, we'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online. We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through Google Services or Google Cloud to support, as I said, whether it's search or GDM, or Google Cloud customers, we can do that in a more efficient manner. We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to optimize our data center. As you know, our strategy is mostly to rely our own self-design and build data centers.\n\nSo, they're industry-leading in terms of both cost and power efficiency at scale. We have our own customized TPUs. They're customized for our own workload, so they do deliver outstanding the superior performance and capex efficiency. So, we're going to be looking at all that when we make decisions as to how we're going to progress capital investments throughout the coming years.\n\nMichael Nathanson -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Shmulik -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I just wanted to follow up to Brian's question from earlier. With your own project Mariner efforts and a competitor's recent launch, it seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google Duplex Vision.\n\nI think when you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going? And really, what does it mean to Google Search outside of Lens? Is there room for both to flourish? Or will they eventually be in conflict with each other? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nLook, I think, first of all, we are definitely seeing a lot of progress in the underlying capabilities of these models. Gemini 2.0 was definitely built with the view of enabling more agentic use cases. And so, I actually -- we are definitely seeing progress inside. And I think we'll be able to do more agentic experiences for our users.\n\nLook, I actually think all of this expands the opportunity space. I think it -- historically, we've had information use cases, but now you can have -- you can act on your information needs in a much deeper way. It's always been our vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, etc. So, I think the opportunity space expands.\n\nI think there's plenty of it, feels very far from a zero-sum game. There's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of use cases to flourish. And I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases. We can start to tackle for our users in Google Search.\n\nAnd all the early work with AIO view shows that users will react positively to that. So, I'm pretty excited about what's ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler -- Analyst\n\nGreat. One on infrastructure and then one on the guidance on revenue. So, Sundar, if we look at the inference cost per 1 million tokens and not the API pricing we see for Gemini versus something like GPT 4 but the raw costs they're generating inference tokens on your TPU stack, how much more efficient do you think you guys are in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your cloud peers? Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to inference? And then Anat, you called out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search. Could you just quantify a little bit of that? Is that kind of the same as when you guys talk about lapping the Asia outbound advertiser channel? Any numbers you could put around that headwind? Thank you very much.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nRoss, look, the whole DPU project started. Our V1 was effectively an inferencing chip. So, we've always part of the reason we have taken the end-to-end stack approach is so that we can definitely drive a strong differentiation in end-to-end optimizing and not only on a cost but on a latency basis, on a performance basis. Be it the Pareto frontier we mentioned, and I think our full stack approach and our TPU efforts all play give a meaningful advantage.\n\nAnd we plan -- you already see that. I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured when we price outside, we pass on the differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward flat models at very attractive value props, which is what is driving developer growth. We've doubled our developers to 4.4 million in just about six months.\n\nVertex usage is up 20x last year. And so, all of that is a direct result of that approach, and so we'll continue doing that.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd on the question regarding my comment on lapping the strength in financial services, this is primarily related to the structural changes with regards to insurance. It's more specifically within Financial Services, it was the insurance segment, and we saw that continue, but it was a one-time kind of a step-up and then we saw throughout the year. I'm not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025. But I'm pleased with the fact that we're seeing, and continuing to see, strength across really all verticals, including retail, and exiting the year in a position of strength.\n\nIf anything, I would highlight as you think about the year, the comments I've made about the impact of FX as well as the fact that we have one less day of revenue in Q1.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. A couple for Philipp. You mentioned higher search usage with overviews.\n\nJust wondering how you're feeling about overall Search usage. Is it accelerating as you integrate more AI? I know there's a lot of traffic growth at competitors with AI, but just wondering if you're seeing a real increase in total volumes of information gathering. And then second on YouTube. Thinking about kind of maybe a move for more professional content to user-generated content.\n\nWhat is that doing for your usage? And how do you think about the margin impact from that? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMaybe on -- just on Search usage, overall, our metrics are healthy. We are continuing to see growth in Search on a year-on-year basis in terms of overall usage. Of course, within that, AI Overviews has seen stronger growth, particularly across all segments of users, including younger users, so it's being well received. But overall, I think through this AI moment, I think Search is continuing to perform well.\n\nAnd as I said earlier, we have a lot more innovations to come this year. I think the product will evolve even more. And I think as you make Search -- as you give -- as you make it more easy for people to interact and ask follow-up questions, etc., I think we have an opportunity to drive further growth.\n\nPhilipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer\n\nAnd some color on your YouTube question. Look, YouTube Ads overall had a very healthy growth in Q4 driven by brand, followed by direct response. The U.S. election advertising led brand revenue growth, and we saw nearly double the spending from 2020.\n\nI mentioned that. We also had a strong contribution from finance, retail, and the tech verticals. So, overall, strong operating. Watch-time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas such as Shorts and Living Room just to set the stage here one more time.\n\nOn your question specifically, the UGC side. Look, we have a very strong position with creators. And we've always said creators are at the center of YouTube's success here. And they're the No.\n\n1 most important thing we care about. And this strong position really gives us a lot of confidence here. Today, we have more than 3 million channels that are actually in the YouTube partner program, which is really an incredible program. So, we're very confident with the position we have and where this goes.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Gawrelski -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Two, please. I want to focus on Gemini and the consumer agent side. Sundar, there was some press reports that suggested you have an ambitious goal on growing the usage by the end of '25.\n\nTwo questions on that, please. First, what's the -- how should we think about the approach that you're going to employ to achieve this goal? Is it more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a stand-alone product? Or is it tighter integration into existing experiences, whether it be search, mail, maps, etc.? And then the second one is, how should we think about the future monetization opportunity of Gemini? Today, it's really a premium subscription offering or a free offering. Over time, do you see an ad component? And anything you can share on that, please? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nLook, first of all, we've had a strong momentum for Gemini on the app side, particularly through the second half of 2024. And some of it is, we've made it more easily accessible. We've brought it to, for example, with a dedicated app on iOS, which has been super positively received and definitely getting a lot of traction there. So, definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out, we just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of models.\n\nSo, 2.0 Flash. I mean, I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. So, that's definitely contributing as well. And so we are rapidly trading.\n\nWe've had a couple of key innovations there. Gemini Live, I think, has been definitely a hit with users as well as for advanced users Gemini Deep Research. So, I think a combination of innovation continually trading on the product, and making it better is driving a lot of usage. And we'll have a lot more to come as we go this year, and we're obviously -- have a partnership with Samsung.\n\nSo, there are other things which will contribute to it as well. On the monetization side, obviously, for now, we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions. But obviously, as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience. And we do have very good ideas for native ad concepts, but you'll see us lead with the user experience.\n\nAnd -- but I do think we're always committed to making the products work and reach billions of users at scale. And advertising has been a great aspect of that strategy. And so, just like you've seen with YouTube, we'll give people options over time. But for this year, I think you'll see us be focused on the subscription direction.\n\nKen Gawrelski -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland -- Senior Director, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet expects to invest about $75 billion in capital expenditures this year as the tech giant expands its artificial intelligence efforts, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking,\u201d the finance chief said during an earnings call\n\nThe company also anticipates headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud, she added.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBig tech companies continue to invest heavily in AI even as the trend is being closely watched by nervous investors looking for signs that such expenditures are paying off.\n\nThe scrutiny is only expected to intensify in the wake of the recent sudden rise of Chinese tech startup DeepSeek, which has attracted global attention after releasing an open-source AI model that it claims was built at a low cost compared with U.S. rivals like ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft expects to spend roughly $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers to train large language models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications during its current fiscal year. And Meta anticipates its 2025 capex to be in the range of $60 billion to $65 billion to support both its generative AI efforts and core business.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s planned $75 billion in capex for the coming year is well above the consensus estimate of $57.9 billion and represents a 43% year-over-year increase, according to a report by Futurum Group analysts.\n\n\u201cWhile Alphabet remains at the forefront of AI integration, mounting competition from firms like DeepSeek and its ongoing infrastructure investments bring renewed scrutiny on capital allocation and near-term returns,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 12% year over year to $96.5 billion, according to results released Tuesday.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased 30% to $12 billion, while Google Services revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting momentum across Google Search and YouTube ads, the company said.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s total capex in the quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in technical infrastructure such as servers and data centers, Ashkenazi told investors.\n\n\u201cWe're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've been using AI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell more than 7% on Wednesday despite its revenue increase, which was short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nFuturum\u2019s analysts said Alphabet\u2019s deepening AI adoption and cloud capacity constraints support its elevated capex strategy, but investor confidence \u201cwill hinge on efficient execution and clear ROI.\u201d The company will have to \u201cwalk a fine line between rapid innovation and financial discipline,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAnalysts at Morningstar said in a client\u2019s note that AI monetization across Alphabet\u2019s businesses is achievable.\n\n\u201cWhile 2025's $75 billion capital expenditure forecast exceeded our expectations, we believe the firm can actually monetize this investment,\u201d they wrote in a client\u2019s note.",

Buying stock can be a smart way to invest and, hopefully, make more money over time.\n\nShake it off is what the stock market did about mega-cap Alphabet's slide, to end higher on Wednesday.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet beat quarterly earnings estimates after Tuesday's close, but its overall sales and Google Cloud revenue both were weaker than analysts' forecasts. However, the tech giant said it would spend more than Wall Street expected on AI. Alphabet shares ended down more than 7%, but investors quickly pivoted to other AI-related shares to pick up some slack.\n\nSuper Micro Computer and Nvidia shares jumped after server maker Super Micro announced full production availability of its AI data center based on Nvidia chips. Super Micro closed up 8% and Nvidia was 5.35% higher.\n\nThe Nasdaq ended up 0.19%, or 38.31 points, to 19,692.33; the broad S&P 500 rose 0.39%, or 23.6 points, to 6,061.48; and the blue-chip Dow added 0.71%, or 317.24 points, to 44,873.28. Gold prices topped $2,900 an ounce for the first time ever. The benchmark 10-year yield fell to 4.428%.\n\nTreasury yields dropped after the Treasury Department said auction sizes, or Treasury supplies, are expected to be unchanged \u201cfor at least the next several quarters.\" That boosted prices on Treasuries, which pushed yields lower. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nAlphabet's AI worries\n\nAlphabet raised its AI spending forecast, but some analysts are still concerned about how these big-spending companies can monetize AI, especially after China's DeepSeek said last week it had built an AI model rivalling ChatGPT and OpenAI at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\"In a period when we have seen AI supposedly become less capital intensive with the introduction of DeepSeek, Alphabet has committed a 43% increase in capital expenditure for 2025,\" said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, an investment management company. \"This is great news for the likes of Nvidia, but for Alphabet we are yet to see a real return on investment on AI spend, so there is a risk that it could be money not being well spent and disappear into a virtual black hole.\"\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's weak growth in its cloud business sparks \"worry that the company is falling behind slightly in the AI arms race that continues apace,\" Barringer said.\n\nOnline retail giant Amazon is slated to report earnings on Thursday, and investors will be scrutinizing its AI plans.\n\nInvestors have options\n\nDespite ups and downs, company results halfway through this earnings season have been generally strong, which help keep the stock market buoyed, analysts said.\n\n\"For the companies that have reported so far fourth-quarter earnings have come in 5.5% above expectations at the start of the season on January 13,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in a report. \"That's higher than the 2.5% surprise in third quarter and 3.7% pre-COVID average. Similarly, revenue surprise of 0.9% was also stronger than 0.7% in third quarter and the 0.7% pre-COVID average.\"\n\nBecause of this, investors have options, analysts said. \"Investors are not engaging in widespread selling,\" said Jochen Stanzl, Chief Market Analyst at UK-based trading platform CMC Markets. \"Instead, they are selectively offloading stocks that are directly affected. This approach is bolstered by the increased market breadth witnessed in January.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank economists also noted \"one of the strongest arguments for elevated U.S. equity valuations today is that we're in an era of high corporate profits relative to GDP (gross domestic product),\" or economic growth.\n\nCorporate news\n\nMajor movers on Wednesday included:\n\nRide-share firm Uber's quarterly operating income significantly undershot expectations, pushing the stock down 7.56%\n\nChip company AMD said its data center revenue, a proxy for AI sales, fell short of expectations in the last three months of the year and it expected current quarter sales to drop 7% from that. AMD shares lost 6.27%.\n\nApple stock dipped 0.14% after Bloomberg News reported that China's antitrust regulator was preparing for a possible investigation of the iPhone maker.\n\nChipotle beat earnings expectations in the last few months of the year but its same-store sales were lower than Wall Street predictions. It also cut its sales outlook for the year. Shares of the fast casual burrito chain dropped 2.56%.\n\nElectronic Arts topped earnings estimates, and the software maker's shares added 7.6%.\n\nEntertainment company Disney beat earnings forecasts but subscribers to its Disney+ streaming channel slipped and is forecast to fall further in the current three-month period. Disney shares lost 2.44%.\n\nSocial media company Snap surprised analysts with a profit and higher-than-expected sales but provided a disappointing earnings outlook. Its shares tanked 8.36%.\n\nMatch, parent of the Tinder dating app, replaced its chief executive and reported an earnings miss. Match shares shed almost 8%.\n\nMattel's shares jumped 15.33% and scored a new 52-week high after the toy maker forecast strong earnings this year on demand for Barbie dolls.\n\nFord said after the market closed it topped quarterly earnings estimates but expected a tough year. Shares slipped about 1.5% in after-hours trading.\n\nQualcomm said it beat analysts' earnings expectations in the first three months of its fiscal year and predicted its current quarter could too. Its stock added 1.63% in after-hours trading.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin edged up after David Sacks, the newly appointed White House AI and crypto czar, said one of his first focuses will be developing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. He thinks legislation will get passed in the next six months.\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, such as the U.S. dollar.\n\nHe also told CNBC on Tuesday his new task force is evaluating and considering\u201cthe feasibility of a bitcoin reserve,\u201d which President Donald Trump suggested during his campaign.\n\nSeparately, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday it's soliciting input from the public to discuss cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin was last down 0.72% at $97,286.84.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

            "content": "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has committed to continue investing in its cloud arm, as the firm\u2019s fourth-quarter results confirmed Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased by 30% to $12bn in the three months to 31 December 2024.\n\nThe year-on-year uptick in Google Cloud\u2019s quarterly revenue was \u201cled by growth\u201d in the company\u2019s core cloud infrastructure offerings, as well as growing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and generative AI (GenAI) propositions, said Alphabet in its financial statement.\n\nThe company previously forecast that it would end 2024 with its combined Cloud and YouTube divisions on an annual revenue run rate of more than $100bn, but the performance of both has exceeded expectations, said Pichai.\n\n\u201cOur AI-powered Google Cloud portfolio is seeing stronger customer demand, and YouTube continues to be the leader in streaming watch-time and podcasts,\u201d said Pichai, in a statement.\n\n\u201cTogether, [Google] Cloud and YouTube exited 2024 at an annual revenue run rate of $110bn \u2026 we are confident of the opportunities ahead, and to accelerate our progress, we expect to invest approximately $75bn in capital expenditure in 2025.\u201d\n\nOn a conference call, to discuss the company\u2019s financial results in more detail, Pichai said the company was rolling out products to the market \u201cfaster than ever before\u201d, which is reflected in the growing product usage and revenue it is seeing.\n\n\u201cOur sophisticated global network of cloud regions and datacentres provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue,\u201d he said, in comments transcribed by Seeking Alpha.\n\n\u201cWe have a unique advantage, because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity.\u201d\n\nThe knock-on effect of this is that the company was able to build 11 new cloud regions and datacentre campuses in the US and the rest of the world in 2024, while making incremental improvements in the performance of the hardware that sits within these facilities during this time period.\n\n\u201cGoogle datacentres deliver nearly [four times] more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just five years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer, are why organisations increasingly choose Google Cloud\u2019s platform,\u201d Pichai continued.\n\n\u201cIn fact, today, cloud customers consume more than [eight times] the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand.\u201d\n\nOn that point, Pichai said the number of \u201cfirst-time commitments\u201d it received from new Google Cloud customers in 2024 was more than double the number it got in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe also deepened [our existing] customer relationships,\u201d he added. \u201cLast year, we closed several strategic deals over $1bn, and the number of deals over $250m doubled from the prior year.\u201d\n\nLee Sustar, principal analyst at IT market watcher Forrester, said the way Pichai flagged the performance of Google Cloud and YouTube in its results suggests he is trying to signal to the market and investors that Alphabet\u2019s fortunes are not solely dependent on the company\u2019s search advertising business.\n\n\u201cIf Google Cloud were a separate company, its AI-driven earnings growth would simply please investors and confirm to customers that the company is a long-term and innovative player for the enterprise IT market,\u201d said Sustar.\n\n\u201cHowever, Google Cloud is part of a complex feedback loop to the rest of the Alphabet portfolio that also requires big investments in AI, such as the ad-driven Search business and YouTube.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s apparently why Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai packaged Cloud and YouTube as a combined success story, citing an annual run rate of $110bn \u2013 a message to investors that Alphabet is less dependent on search advertising than in the past.\n\n\u201cEnterprise business customers looking for long-term bets on AI cloud services will have to take a closer look and assess the investment plans for Google Cloud and is competitors,\u201d added Sustar.",

We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance.\n\nFlash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow we\u2019re making 2.0 Flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates \u2014 so stay tuned.\n\nLate last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model. The progress to scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon.\n\nGemini 2.0\u2019s advances in multimodality and native tool use enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\n\nOne early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December and is rolling out to Android users all over the world.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on iOS last November.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks, and Project Astra.

That\u2019s why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just six months ago.\n\nAnd we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications.

Google Cloud has more demand for A.I. tools than capacity to provide customers with them, said Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer. The company is working hard to bring more capacity online and ease the constraints, she added.\n\nMs. Ashkenazi also warned that the growth rates for Google\u2019s cloud division might vary in 2025 as the company continues to purchase more equipment and construct more facilities. She added that she expected Alphabet\u2019s capital expenditures to be $16 billion to $18 billion in the first quarter, and that the quarterly figure would change over the course of the year.\n\nThe Chinese A.I. start-up DeepSeek caused American markets to quake last week after its chatbot app soared in popularity. DeepSeek has said it trained its system for just $6 million, a fraction of what tech giants like Google spend. Alphabet\u2019s stock took a hit, among many others, though it later recovered. Tech industry insiders have since questioned some of DeepSeek\u2019s claims.\n\nStill, the episode highlighted Alphabet\u2019s crucial need to get A.I. right, in order to keep its digital services relevant to consumers and businesses that have never been more spoiled for choices. And it added heft to questions over whether Google should consider more fully embracing the so-called open source development used by DeepSeek and other A.I. start-ups.",

The company's revenue growth, as well as growth for its search business, its YouTube ads business and its services unit were all slower compared to a year ago.\n\nGoogle's advertising revenue growth was 10.6%, compared to 11% a year ago. Search revenue growth was 12.5%, compared to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. YouTube ads revenue growth was 13.8% compared to 15.5% a year ago, and growth for the company's services business was 10.2%, compared to 12.4% a year ago.\n\nThe company also announced that it plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to expand on its AI strategy. That is above the $58.84 billion that Wall Street expected, according to FactSet.\n\nAlphabet said it expects capital expenditures for the first quarter to come in between $16 billion and $18 billion, which was also higher than the $14.3 billion that was expected, per FactSet.\n\nAlphabet's capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 billion, which is higher than the $13.26 billion Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount.\n\nChief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said on an earnings call with investors that the figure primarily reflects the company's investment in its technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investments in servers, followed by data centers \"to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.\"\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter net income increased more than 28% to $26.54 billion from $20.69 billion a year prior.\n\nAlphabet also reported disappointing cloud revenue at $11.96 billion during the quarter, compared to $12.19 billion, expected by Wall Street. Despite the miss, the cloud unit's revenue increased 30% from the year prior. Alphabet has been drawing profit from the cloud business as it tries to keep up with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nAsked if revenue for the company's cloud unit could have been higher with more compute capacity, Ashkenazi said the company had strong demand for AI products in the fourth quarter, and that it \"exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\"\n\n\"We are in a tight supply-demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online,\" Ashkenazi continued, saying the company will be adding more capacity throughout the year.\n\nAlphabet's Other Bets segment, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $400 million in the fourth quarter. That came behind Wall Street's expectations of $616.4 million, according to StreetAccount, and it was down more than 39% from $657 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company made a series of announcements in the fourth quarter related to Waymo, showing confidence in its ability to commercialize its self-driving car company more quickly.\n\nWaymo's robotaxi service now operates in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, covering more than 500 square miles of public roads. In December, the company said it plans to launch its commercial service in Austin, Texas, and through the Uber app in Austin and Atlanta in 2025. The company also announced that it will begin testing Waymo in Tokyo, its first international expansion.",

            "content": "Google plans to insert ads in its Gemini multimodal model, following the recent addition of advertisements in the AI Overviews portion of its search engine as it seeks to recoup the high cost of processing AI workloads.\n\n\u201cWe do have very good ideas for native ad concepts,\u201d said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in a call with analysts to discuss fourth-quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday (Feb. 4). \u201cBut you will see us lead with the user experience\u201d and first making sure it works at scale for billions of people.\n\nGemini ads will not come in 2025. Google said it would focus on offering a free and paid version of Gemini, which competes with ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle already began inserting ads in its AI Overviews, or AI-powered summarized answers to user search queries, since October.\n\nGoogle CBO Philipp Schindler said that thus far, AI Overview ads are monetizing at \u201capproximately the same rate\u201d as ads in traditional Google Search instead of cannibalizing revenue.\n\nSchindler added that this bodes well for Google to experiment and \u201cinnovate even more.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s core business, search, is under fire after the tech giant lost an antitrust court case last year accusing it of monopolizing online search and advertising markets by entering into exclusive partnerships. The remedy phase of the lawsuit is yet to be finalized.\n\nMorningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan wrote in a research note that Google parent Alphabet\u2019s priority is to preserve its strong search ad business \u2014 and using AI to keep it in the lead.\n\n\u201cWe see the firm\u2019s investments in AI as a continuation of this effort to safeguard its core product, Google Search,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe that by leveraging generative AI, Google can not only improve its own search quality via features such as AI Overviews, but also improve its advertising business by augmenting its ability to target customers with relevant ads.\u201d\n\nKhan said the majority of Alphabet\u2019s revenue comes from search. Over the years, Google has invested \u201cconsiderably\u201d to improve its search capabilities, to ensure that its search engine remains people\u2019s preferred choice.\n\nGoogle Weighs In on DeepSeek\n\nPichai said that DeepSeek proves something the company has known for a long time \u2014 that costs, latency and performance will continue to improve.\n\nThe CEO pointed to the recently released Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash Thinking models as \u201csome of the most efficient out there, including compared to DeepSeek\u2019s V3 and R1\u201d models.\n\nPichai said it was possible for Google to continue to increase efficiency while improving performance due to its \u201cfull stack\u201d approach to AI \u2014 encompassing AI infrastructure, research and applications and platforms \u2014 focus on optimization, and \u201cobsession\u201d with cost per query.\n\nAlso, the proportion of AI workloads has been shifting from training frontier or cutting-edge foundation models to inferencing when these models are actually used. Typically, training costs are higher than inferencing costs, although the latter can add up over time.\n\nFrontier model developers like Google pay for training costs; clients of Google Cloud pay for inferencing costs.\n\n\u201cThat trend is good,\u201d Pichai said. The recent trends towards reasoning, or thinking, AI models is good because these use inferencing.\n\nAsked if agentic AI will affect Google search, Pichai said it will only expand the market. \u201cPlenty of room for many new types of use cases to flourish.\u201d\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nAlphabet reported net income of $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, beating the consensus estimate of $2.12 per share. Revenue came to $96.5 billion, slightly below consensus of $96.7 billion, as compiled by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nQuarterly revenue in the quarter grew by 12%, which was its slowest pace since 2023. Investors did not like the news, selling off shares by 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet expects to spend $75 billion in capex this year, mainly towards data centers, servers and networking infrastructure.\n\nKhan continues to be bullish on Alphabet.\n\n\u201cOn the antitrust front, we don\u2019t foresee a material deterioration in Google\u2019s search business resulting from governmental or judicial intervention,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile there is a range of possible outcomes depending on what remedial steps are imposed, we think it is likely that Google will maintain its leadership position in search and text-based advertising in the long term.\u201d",

Regarding Alphabet, the debate is about how AI\u2019s advancement will impact the company\u2019s bread-and-butter Search business. It is a business where Alphabet has dominant market share, and it is also highly profitable.\n\nWill the development of AI hurt Alphabet because OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and even Microsoft\u2019s Bing will take market share from Google, once thought to be nearly invincible in the online search market? Or will Alphabet\u2019s Gemini product, first announced in December 2023, allow the company to dominate the Search market for years or even decades to come given its brand recognition?\n\nAs background, Gemini is designed to advance natural language understanding and meet certain thresholds in conversational and contextual understanding. In short, it is meant to provide even more accurate and personalized results, which would be a replay of what made Google so successful decades ago.\n\nDespite its scale and dominance, Alphabet doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new and improved Bing engine are current competitors to Google Search while Meta (NASDAQ:META) is extending beyond social media and into the online search market with its AI-powered assistant.\n\nAlphabet runs into Microsoft often, as it is also one of its primary adversaries in the public cloud services market along with Amazon\u2019s formidable AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finally, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many other video streaming platforms go head-to-head against the company\u2019s YouTube segment.\n\nStory Continues",

Zuckerberg said more computing power is needed for Meta AI, the company\u2019s AI assistant that has been deployed in its social media and devices and is now serving over a billion people.\n\nMicrosoft held an earnings call Thursday (Jan. 30) in which CEO Satya Nadella said that \u201cDeepSeek has had some real innovations\u201d but that the AI industry has become more efficient and lowered prices as well.\n\nWhen the cost to use deployed AI models (inference) comes down, \u201cthat means people consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cThat type of optimization means AI will be much more ubiquitous.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Nadella said.",

            "content": "The emergence of a small Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company called DeepSeek initially put a giant hole in the U.S. stock market. Tech stocks -- particularly those connected to the AI trend -- got crushed, and GPU king Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) lost roughly $600 billion of its market cap in a single day as investors grew concerned about the company's moat, and whether AI software could be trained and powered at lower costs with less powerful chips.\n\nNow the big question that analysts and investors are grappling with is how serious a threat DeepSeek actually is to the AI sector's status quo. Some think that the company may have invested more money and used higher-quality chips to develop the DeepSeek R1 large language model than it's letting on, while others think its claims are legitimate. Some also think DeepSeek's innovations could prove a net positive for other AI companies long term. After the recent sell-off, would investors be better served to buy the dip on Nvidia or Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%)?\n\nDeepSeek's arrival is hurting Nvidia now, but could help it long term\n\nThe big reason that Nvidia got hit so hard by DeepSeek is that the Chinese company allegedly managed to create a chatbot with capabilities rivaling ChatGPT, but at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek says it trained its model for just $5.6 million and used older Nvidia chips to do it. Meanwhile, OpenAI has spent more than $100 million to train certain ChatGPT models.\n\nNvidia issued a statement on Jan. 27 that seemingly praised DeepSeek and said that the chips used to build its model were \"fully export control compliant.\" The chipmaker also said DeepSeek shows why its chips are needed and that they will be needed in the future. One group of analysts seemed to concur. Cantor analyst C.J. Muse called the sell-off a complete overreaction:\n\nWe think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI (artificial general intelligence) seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox (what happens when improved efficiency actually boosts demand, causing resources to be used up more quickly overall) almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.\n\nMuse also noted that there are some doubts about what chips DeepSeek actually used, but he ultimately believes the innovation is bringing the world closer to an artificial general intelligence and will ultimately lead to more widespread use of AI. However, there is also a camp that is concerned DeepSeek is starting to shrink Nvidia's incredible moat, which has supported its 75% operating profit margins.\n\nAnalysts at BMO said while there are still a lot of questions, the current information available suggests that DeepSeek likely used servers with 50% to 75% less power intensity than servers that use Nvidia's most recent GPUs. No analysts have outright said they were putting a sell rating on Nvidia stock yet, but the backdrop remains uncertain.\n\nAlphabet: Facing similar threats but in a different place\n\nAlphabet faces a similar threat from DeepSeek. However, its stock didn't sell off as hard, largely because it's in a different place than Nvidia. For one thing, its stock didn't perform nearly as well in 2024.\n\nAlphabet has been dealing with its own issues, notably including a Department of Justice lawsuit that accused the company of using monopolistic practices to dominate the digital ad space and employing pricing methods that essentially made it the only shop in town. A federal judge agreed with Justice. The department then submitted a filing that some view as asking the judge to force Alphabet to break itself up and sell its Chrome browser. While many suspect a breakup plan won't actually come to fruition, it would adversely impact the company if it did.\n\nAdditionally, while investors have priced more and more potential into Nvidia's stock, Alphabet's stock price may not fully reflect its AI strengths and opportunities. The company actually builds AI data center chips of its own, for example, and its DeepMind unit is similar to OpenAI. Yet according to D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, these divisions -- potentially worth multiple hundreds of billions of dollars -- are not adequately priced into the stock. Luria still has a hold rating on Alphabet, but would become more optimistic about it if management makes more of an effort to unlock value.\n\nWhich should you buy?\n\nAs things stand, I don't foresee impending doom for Nvidia. I think the magnitude of the DeepSeek-driven sell-off also had to do with the fact that Nvidia had been trading at an elevated valuation, making it more vulnerable to a correction. Even after the sell-off, the stock still trades at about 41 times forward earnings, which may end up looking like a discount someday. For now, though, I'd recommend buying Alphabet over the AI chip king. Alphabet is still dealing with the overhang of the Justice Department lawsuit, but I don't expect it to have to sell its Chrome browser. Furthermore, the stock only trades at about 22 times forward earnings, and that price may not be giving the company any credit for its AI businesses.",

The analyst said that despite his cautious outlook on Google Search, he is \u201cmostly constructive on the 4Q setup.\u201d Shmulik expects Google Search\u2019s year-over-year growth to remain steady at about 11%, though he cautioned about forex headwinds.\n\nFurther, Shmulik expects YouTube to continue its re-acceleration, thanks to encouraging political ad spend and CTV tailwinds.

While the big tech giant will face some tough comps, especially in its advertising business, I\u2019m bullish on its shares ahead of its results. I expect another strong performance from Google Cloud and not many surprises in AI infrastructure spending to keep costs in check.\n\nIf Alphabet beats estimates again, it will mark the company\u2019s eighth consecutive quarter of exceeding EPS expectations, following a four-quarter streak of misses in 2022 and 2023 when its investment thesis was put to the test amid stagnant growth pre-AI.\n\nWhat to Look for in Alphabet\u2019s Q4 Earnings\n\nMuch of my optimism supporting Alphabet rests on the combination of leadership in two secular growth trends: digital advertising and cloud. Both have grown rapidly, showing very high profitability in markets with no sign of reaching saturation.\n\nAny signs of these trends continuing in Q4 for Alphabet should be enough to push the stock higher. To beat Wall Street estimates, Alphabet must report EPS above $2.13 and revenues above $96.67 billion, i.e., annual growth of 29.8% and 12%, respectively. Considering the strong growth rates in both the top and bottom lines in recent quarters, the more modest growth numbers compared to other quarters may reflect Alphabet experiencing higher comps in Q4.\n\nFor 2024, analysts estimate that Alphabet will end up with EPS of $7.99, which would mark a solid 37.7% annual growth, plus revenues of around $350 billion, up 13.8%. However, the trend for FY2025 shows a slowdown in bottom-line growth, with analysts projecting just 12.6% growth compared to 2024.\n\nThe Key Topics for GOOGL Earnings Day\n\nAlthough Alphabet generates the majority of its revenues (around 75%) from advertising, and therefore growth in Search is key for GOOGL\u2019s positive outlook, I believe the main topic of conversation on earnings day will be its rapidly growing cloud business, which has been expanding faster than its major peers.\n\nIn Q3, the most recent quarter, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue jumped 34.5% year-over-year to $11.3 billion, marking the impressive feat of being the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. While Alphabet\u2019s cloud segment still has a lot of work to do in matching the profitability of its peers like AWS and Azure, margins improved significantly to 17.4%, up from 11% in Q2.\n\nMuch like the other hyperscalers, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), the margin expansion for Google Cloud reflects its drive to deliver high-quality cloud AI services, particularly in Alphabet\u2019s case, blended with products like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Workspace. As a result, Alphabet has already spent $38.2 billion in CapEx during 2024, marking a 44% increase in investment compared to the same period last year.\n\nThat said, the trend is for ongoing CapEx growth, with management hinting in Q3 that it plans to invest at the same level for Q4 (approximately $13 billion). Nevertheless, for FY2025, management said that expenditures will not increase at the same percentage rate as in 2023 and 2024, but there will still be an additional increase.\n\nAs seen with Microsoft during the current earnings season, a scenario of high spending on AI infrastructure coupled with a slowdown in cloud growth and margins (likely temporary) was not well received by the markets, even though AI demand is still robust. However, since Google Cloud is still consolidating growth and margins close to those of the top two hyperscalers, I anticipate steady results in this regard for Q4.\n\nPotential Risks Behind a Strong GOOGL Outlook\n\nAlthough the bullish outlook on Alphabet looks strong heading into Q4, a rise in share price isn\u2019t guaranteed, even if the company beats expectations across the board.\n\nSince Alphabet typically doesn\u2019t guide margins and revenues\u2014only CapEx\u2014this could be the metric the market focuses on the most. However, perhaps the main point of attention will be the performance of Google Search and YouTube. Over the last five quarters, the segment has shown double-digit increases, most recently jumping 12% year-over-year in Q3 2024. This strong performance helped offset shortfalls in YouTube revenues, which grew 12% in the same period, down from 13% in Q2.\n\nIn a previous earnings call, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that advertising revenue would slow down compared to the strong comps of mid-2023, mainly due to the surge in advertising from APAC-based retailers last year. Therefore, should growth figures in Search and YouTube come in much lower than 12%, this could be a warning sign for a less bullish post-Q4 reaction.\n\nIs Alphabet (GOOGL) a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nAt TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus for GOOGL is a Moderate Buy, with 21 out of 29 analysts rating the stock as a Buy and the remaining eight rating it a Hold. Notably, not a single analyst rates GOOGL as a Sell. The average price target is $219 per share, suggesting a ~9% upside from its current price.\n\nA special mention goes to the top-performing analyst on GOOGL over the past year, Mark Kelley from Stifel Nicolaus. Kelley has achieved an impressive 82% success rate over 3 months, a 96% rate over 1 year, and a 100% success rate over 2 years. Over the past 12 months, he has achieved a 31.6% average return on GOOGL stock. The analyst currently holds a Buy recommendation on GOOGL and reiterated his Buy rating last month.\n\nAlphabet Set to Extend Prolific Earnings Streak Tomorrow\n\nThe expectation for Alphabet\u2019s Q4 earnings is continued double-digit growth in its key segments, focusing on Google Cloud, particularly its margin growth, which could offset any headwinds in its advertising business due to tough comps.\n\nI\u2019m reiterating my Buy rating on Alphabet ahead of its earnings, recognizing that Q4 could be an essential piece of the puzzle in its long-term growth story. However, the short-term upside may be limited since the stock is at all-time highs and more susceptible to profit-taking should GOOGL even marginally disappoint.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer",

For the period, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising sales stands at $71.6 billion, nearly 10% higher year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, Alphabet has regularly exceeded our consensus expectations on the metric, with just one miss over the last six quarters. The company\u2019s advertising results will likely be boosted by AI implementations that have delivered more relevant results for consumers.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that advertising rival Meta Platforms came out with positive results on this metric, providing us a small level of read-through of what to expect. Both companies have been implementing AI to boost user engagement.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is the company\u2019s Cloud results, which have also been positive over the last six periods. Our consensus estimate for Cloud sales stands at $12.1 billion, reflecting a big 32% jump from the year-ago period.\n\nThe Cloud year-over-year growth rate here is quite significant, though it does reflect a small deceleration from the most prior period.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO, delivered a positive statement following its last release, stating, \u2018In Search, our new AI features are expanding what people can search for and how they search for it. In Cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals. And YouTube\u2019s total ads and subscription revenues surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time.\u2019\n\nWhile the ad and cloud momentum are big positives, commentary surrounding CapEx will also take a front seat, though those fears have seemingly been eased following the release of Meta\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s quarterly releases.\n\nAWS Remains Key for Amazon\n\nAnalysts have shown a sliver of positivity for AMZN\u2019s upcoming release concerning headline figures, with both EPS and sales expectations moving modestly higher over recent months. The company is expected to see a strong 50% year-over-year climb in EPS alongside a 10% sales boost.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike GOOGL, Amazon\u2019s cloud results will be in heavy focus due to Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.\n\nAWS results fell short of our consensus estimate in the prior period, snapping a string of back-to-back beats. Our current expectation of $28.8 billion in sales for the metric reflects a 19% move higher year-over-year, nearly matching the same growth rate from the latest period.\n\nThe Cloud results will likely see tailwinds from increasing adoption of AI-related tools, with the company regularly updating the product suite.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nMega-cap titans Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN headline the reporting docket this week, nearly wrapping up the period for the Mag 7 group overall. After the duo reports, we\u2019ll just have the beloved NVIDIA of the group yet to report, whose results are expected near the end of February.\n\nThe setup heading into the releases seems to be one of slight positivity, with results from peers Meta Platforms and Microsoft going a long way in easing fears concerning CapEx geared around AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nAdvertising results will again be key for Alphabet, with investors hopeful that implementations geared toward user engagement continue to provide tailwinds for the business. Concerning Amazon, AWS results will likely take center stage again, with increased adoption of tools likely to boost the segment's results again. Guidance will be most critical for both companies, likely dictating their post-earnings moves.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 10 Tech Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other stocks about which Jim Cramer has made bold predictions.\n\nThe DeepSeek selloff which occurred earlier this week gave Jim Cramer plenty to talk about. It saw one of his most frequently mentioned stocks, the GPU firm responsible for making AI chips, lose nearly $600 billion in value during a single day of trading. Other stocks exposed to data center spending didn\u2019t fare well either, and cumulatively, these stocks lost a trillion dollars of market value.\n\nAs investors pondered whether the billions of dollars in AI spending would actually materialize, Cramer discussed the potential offered by the firm\u2019s latest Blackwell AI GPUs. The debate surrounding low AI costs primarily centers around large language models (LLMs), and Cramer believes that the firm\u2019s CEO is focused on the bigger picture.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201cRemember, Blackwell, which is the current iteration, Blackwell\u2019s about video. It\u2019s just about video. And video is incredibly important. Because video is the ability to make it so that the robots work. Robots do not work on the current one. And I think robots are the next frontier. So I don\u2019t think necessarily that uh . . . . Elon Musk, who may be focused on many different things, that Elon Musk says I don\u2019t wanna buy [the AI GPUs]\u201dAs DeepSeek wreaked havoc on the stock market, Cramer also shared his thoughts about the model. The CNBC TV show host shared that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d Cramer remained skeptical about the authenticity of the data that DeepSeek had shared. According to him \u201cThe difference here I think is that, if we really think that they are playing by American rules and they\u2019re telling us everything, then maybe that\u2019s why we keep seeing such a great number, a growth number from the Chinese economy.\u201d\n\nOne particular DeepSeek feature that he was quick to note was censorship. Chinese social media and technology platforms cannot provide users with information critical of the government or the state narrative. When Cramer asked DeepSeek \u201cWhat famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank?\u201d the model initially replied by stating \u201cthe famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he shared. While this was all good, he added the model then \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope.\u201d\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA -4.68%) CEO Elon Musk has a history of making optimistic forecasts about the company. And during his conference call with investors for the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended Dec. 31), he made his boldest prediction yet.\n\nHe thinks Tesla could be the most valuable company in the world one day, with a bigger market capitalization than the next top five companies combined. As of this writing, the five largest companies in the world are Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, which have a combined value of $14.7 trillion.\n\nCould Tesla really be worth that much in the future? A new $10 trillion opportunity might be the secret to getting there, according to Musk, and it has nothing to do with electric vehicles (EVs). Read on.\n\nTesla's core business is struggling right now\n\nBefore diving into Tesla's potential, it's important to address the elephant in the room: Its core business, selling passenger EVs, isn't doing so great. The company delivered 1.78 million cars during 2024, a 1% drop compared to 2023.\n\nThat isn't good news considering passenger EV sales still account for almost 79% of the company's total revenue.\n\nNot so long ago, Musk was forecasting 50% annual growth in deliveries as far as the eye can see, but a series of challenges, such as increasing competition and softening demand for EVs, dampened Tesla's sales.\n\nPlus, Musk feels absolutely certain that autonomous vehicles are the future, so rather than engaging in a race to the bottom by producing cheaper and cheaper passenger EVs, he wants Tesla to focus on its new Cybercab robotaxi instead.\n\nThe Cybercab will run entirely on Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) software, so it won't come with pedals or even a steering wheel. FSD Version 13 is now available in beta mode, and owners of Tesla's passenger vehicles can test it in the real world in a supervised manner. It's the most advanced version so far.\n\nAccording to the company's latest vehicle safety report, cars using FSD Version 13 are involved in one crash per 5.9 million miles driven, versus the typical American driver, who crashes once every 700,000 miles on average. As a result, Musk believes there will be Tesla vehicles running entirely on unsupervised FSD in Austin, Texas, as well as several other cities by the end of 2025.\n\nAutonomous driving could transform Tesla's economics. Rather than just selling cars, the company can build a massive ride-hailing network for its Cybercabs, which can earn revenue by hauling passengers and completing commercial deliveries 24 hours a day. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management thinks this will be a $14 trillion opportunity by 2027, and other Wall Street analysts have also called this a trillion-dollar market for Tesla.\n\nThe $10 trillion opportunity: Optimus\n\nThe Cybercab opportunity could pale in comparison to Optimus, a humanoid robot that Musk is more excited about than any other product in the company's history. He says it probably has a thousand times more uses than a car, which means it can be sold into a variety of different markets.\n\nMusk says several thousand Optimus robots will be used internally at Tesla this year to complete repetitive jobs humans don't want to do, like transporting sheet metal to a welding line. They could eventually be deployed in factories all over the world across countless industries, and they might also be popular in households to perform basic cleaning tasks.\n\nIn fact, Musk thinks humanoid robots will outnumber humans by 2040. He believes Tesla will manufacture them at a cost of around $20,000, which opens the door to a sale price of under $30,000. That price will probably decline over time as the company becomes more efficient, and as competitors enter the market.\n\nMusk put forward some ambitious targets in his fourth-quarter conference call with investors. He thinks the production ramp-up will potentially grow fivefold every year from now to eventually reach 100 million annual units.\n\nIn the long run, he says Optimus could generate north of $10 trillion in revenue.\n\nTesla stock is extremely expensive\n\nIf Tesla's market cap does eventually exceed the combined value of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, it will translate into a stock price of around $4,660. That implies a 1,200% upside from where it trades today.\n\nThe prospect of a 12-fold return sounds enticing, but investors need to consider the potential risks. Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) plunged by 53% during 2024 to $2.04, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 190.7. That means the stock is substantially more expensive than Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet right now:\n\nTesla stock would have to fall by 78% just to trade in line with the average P/E of those five stocks (40.2). That is the potential downside investors could face if Musk and his team fail to deliver meaningful progress on platforms like FSD and Optimus over the next year.\n\nI think 2025 will be a transition year for the company. The Cybercab isn't expected to reach mass production until 2026, and Optimus production figures will probably be nominal for several more years. In fact, Musk isn't fully confident Tesla will hit its target of 10,000 humanoids this year.\n\nThat means its financial performance will hinge almost exclusively on passenger EV sales for at least the next 12 months. Considering they shrank last year, it makes the company's valuation even harder to stomach.\n\nI don't recommend investors jump in on Tesla stock today, but if they do, they must be prepared to hold it for at least the next five years to maximize their chances of a positive return.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best big name stocks to invest in now.\n\nBig name stocks refer to well-known companies that are widely recognized and have a significant presence in the stock market. These companies are often industry leaders and are included in major stock indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Nasdaq Composite. These companies are characterized by their large market capitalizations, stable financial performance, and strong brand recognition.\n\nIn an interview on January 22, Dave Sekera, US Market Strategist at Morningstar, provided a detailed outlook for large-cap stocks in 2025. Sekera highlighted that the performance of large-cap stocks in 2024 was particularly strong, driven by several key factors. The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and platforms, especially in the first half of 2024, significantly boosted the performance of large-cap tech stocks. Additionally, the US economy remained resilient, with faster-than-expected growth, which supported the performance of large-cap stocks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s easing of monetary policy also played a crucial role in driving the market higher.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024.\n\nHowever, Sekera noted that the rate of monetary policy easing is now slowing, and the market is pricing in fewer rate cuts this year than originally projected. This, combined with sticky inflation and a rise in long-term interest rates, suggests that the tailwinds that supported large-cap stocks in 2024 are beginning to recede.\n\nFurthermore, Sekera pointed out that the concentration of market returns in 2024 was notable, with 10 stocks accounting for 58% of the market gain, despite representing only 30% of the market capitalization. This concentration is less than the 67% peak in June 2024, indicating a broadening of returns in the second half of the year. Despite this broadening, many of these large-cap stocks, particularly those tied to AI, are now trading at significant premiums. Sekera advised investors to be cautious, as very few of these large-cap stocks are currently undervalued, with most trading at 2-star or 1-star ratings, indicating they are overvalued.\n\nBig name stocks remain a compelling investment choice, offering stability, strong financial performance, and long-term growth potential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best big name stocks to invest in now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to identify well-known, large-cap companies, that have a significant presence in the United States stock market.

            "content": "Can Trump's 2nd act work for the working class while giving back to his super donors?\n\ntoggle caption Shawn Thew/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt has long been said that politics \"makes strange bedfellows,\" but some such alliances are surely stranger than others.\n\nTake, for example, the emerging collaboration of working-class voters with the very, very wealthy in America who have increasingly allied themselves with President Trump.\n\nWho could fail to see a row of billionaires \u2014 including Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tesla's Elon Musk and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 invited to sit with the new president's Cabinet appointees in the Capitol at the inauguration ceremony? Yet network exit polls tell us Trump's share of the popular vote in 2024 was higher among those with household income of less than $50,000 than among those whose households made more. Among voters with household income above $100,000 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won rather easily.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHistorically, this is beyond anomalous. Household income has been strongly correlated with party preference for generations with the higher income groups tending to be more Republican. \"Rich versus poor\" has been as common a narrative as North versus South, Protestant versus Catholic or urban versus rural.\n\nBut today we are confronted with an alliance between those whom political scientists might call plutocrats and those who are increasingly labeled populists. The contrast is stark, but the symbiosis is unmistakable. And we all await the outcome as the populist in Trump tries to co-exist with his newfound ally Musk, the world's richest man with abundant clout in the new administration.\n\nGoing back to even during colonial times, some writers used plutocrat to describe wealthy men who entered politics to protect their fortunes and those of their class. Where their influence prevailed, the result was sometimes called plutocracy, or the rule of the rich. (Today, it might be closer to rule by the richest.) It comes from the Roman god Pluto, lord of the underworld and the hidden wealth of the Earth, and as that derivation suggests, it has been an epithet associated not just with privilege but with unfair advantage and exploitation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFar more common and more eagerly embraced is the term populist, which has historically attached to advocates for ordinary farmers and wage earners. Populism has pressed the claims of the less powerful against those of the landowners, the financiers, the industrialists and other species of elite. In successive eras of cartoons and caricature, it has been the \"little guy\" against the \"fat cats.\"\n\ntoggle caption Pool/Getty Images\n\nTrump has shown a certain affinity with, and owes a clear debt to, many of the little guys \u2014 what he called in 2017 \"the forgotten men and women.\" But he also has shown a certain affinity with and owes an enormous debt to some of the fattest cats of all. Musk alone has been reported to have directed $250 million to the Trump cause during the campaign. How will he and other ultra-wealthy business figures mesh with the Trump who made a show of working a shift at a McDonald's last fall?\n\n\n\nBig names from class struggles past\n\nPresidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, both scions of an old and prosperous Dutch dynasty in New York, enlarged their vision and political prospects by transcending allegiance to their economic caste. The former Roosevelt warned of \"malefactors of great wealth\" and the latter drove the moneyed classes to distraction with his Depression-era New Deal and his challenge to their hegemony. (\"I welcome their hatred,\" he proclaimed to the Democratic National Convention that renominated him in 1936.)\n\nNeither Roosevelt cared that much for the term populist, associated as it was in the early 1900s with smaller and primarily rural movements. The high point for those movements had come in 1896, when an orator named William Jennings Bryan gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention condemning the gold standard for setting the value of the currency. Bryan and like-minded figures wanted to use silver as well, making it easier for farmers and others to pay their debts to banks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat \"Cross of Gold\" speech carried him to the Democratic nomination that year and again in 1900 and 1908. But he lost each time. Bryan had briefly been a congressman from Nebraska but was far better known as a newspaper editorialist and a spell-binding speaker who addressed numerous crowds from makeshift stages on railroad cars.\n\nTrump, too, entered politics from a background in the news and entertainment media of his era. And with his small town, egalitarian rallies and appeals to \"the forgotten man and woman,\" he has revived the term populism in the political lexicon and gone further with it than anyone since Bryan's heyday.\n\ntoggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhen Trump won his first nomination in 2016, he was competing for crossover voters with a candidate on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wowed big crowds by vowing to govern for \"all the people\" and \"not just the 1%.\" Sanders did well among working-class voters and in the most populous states but ultimately had fewer delegates at the 2016 national convention than Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump humbled a huge field of rivals on the Republican side that year, winning primaries and caucuses largely by energizing those who had not voted in recent election cycles. He was not another establishment-credentialed Republican and that was his secret weapon. When he won, his campaign strategist Steve Bannon compared it to Andrew Jackson's frontier-bred uprising in 1828. Trump went on to hang a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump in his first term\n\nBut if Trump's rapid rise as a Washington outsider recalled those of 19th century populists, Trump's actual performance as president was quite different. In fact it had more in common with the record of President William McKinley, the Ohio Republican who defeated Bryan in 1896 and again in 1900 while defending the gold standard and representing the interests of business and industry.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump may recall Bryan's magnetic power over his followers, but his policies seem quite consciously modeled on McKinley. In his most recent campaign, Trump lavished explicit praise on the \"great\" William McKinley and his protective tariffs, which Trump insists dictated terms to U.S. trading partners and made America rich.\n\nAlthough long out of fashion with most economists and blamed for trade wars and depressions, tariffs have retained a strong fascination for Trump.\n\nMcKinley was quite popular with the Republican Party of his day, dominated as it was by the ultra-rich railroad, financial and manufacturing interests of the \"Gilded Age.\" So it was almost eerie when Trump in his second inaugural address decreed that Alaska's Mount Denali would again be officially Mount McKinley. The tallest peak in the U.S. had been Mount McKinley before President Obama changed the name to the one preferred by most Alaska native tribes. The timing of this latest switch is certainly notable given Trump wants to restore McKinley's reliance on protective tariffs on imports as a means to replace income taxes and help make America great again.\n\nMcKinley's time in office also included the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of colonial territories such as the Philippines and other islands. Trump referred to this idea in his second inaugural address as well, saying the U.S. \"will once again consider itself a growing nation,\" one that \"expands our territory.\" Trump has proposed such an expansion: adding Greenland and perhaps Canada \u2014 and part of Panama as well.\n\n\n\nTrump improvises his own populist narrative\n\nTrump had built his political following over a quarter century not as a champion of the economic elite from which he came \u2014 the son of a real estate mogul and product of private schools \u2014 but rather on familiarity to a media audience. He was a high-profile businessman and tabloid celebrity in Manhattan in the 1980s and 1990s. His first foray into presidential politics was made early in the 2000 cycle in what was called the Reform Party.\n\ntoggle caption Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt was the creation of another businessman-candidate named Ross Perot, who ran two presidential campaigns in the 1990s. Perot was a billionaire when that term still inspired awe. But he campaigned as the independent voice of the common folk, stressing his plain Texan talk. He soared in the early polls in 1992, bringing out voters who made modest livings with less than a college degree and had felt unseen by most convention candidates for president.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen Perot decided not to run a third time in 2000 he turned over his movement to a wide assortment of unconventional candidates competing for his mantle. They included pro wrestler and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and, for a while, Trump himself. But it was not yet Trump's time. He stepped back and conceded the field to Pat Buchanan, a former speechwriter for Richard Nixon who had become a media star on TV talk shows and then challenged the first President Bush for the GOP nomination in 1992. Buchanan's campaign motto in 2000 was \"America First.\"\n\nTrump became a media star in his own right with a primetime hit \u2014 the network TV \"reality show\" The Apprentice (and later The Celebrity Apprentice). Now known to a far wider audience, he used his fame and Twitter account to popularize a fringe theory about then-President Obama being foreign born and thus ineligible to be president. Even after Obama had released his official long-form birth certificate from Hawaii, Trump persisted in promoting the \"birther\" myth. He did not back off that claim until after he had become the official GOP nominee in the late summer of 2016, at which time he took credit for settling the controversy.\n\nBut Trump's willingness to champion this and other fringe theories connected him to a hardcore of voters such as those who told pollsters they believed Obama was a Muslim throughout his tenure as president. Trump first broke out from the GOP pack late in 2015 after calling for a \"complete ban\" on Muslims entering the U.S.\n\nThe governing philosophy\n\nOnce in office, having surprised most political prognosticators and perhaps even himself, Trump in his first term pursued a relatively familiar list of Republican priorities. His main legislative achievement came in his first year with the passage of an enormous tax cut that was popular among Republicans generally but that greatly benefited high-income earners and holders of wealth. Of at least equal importance was his appointment of more than 300 federal judges, including three members of the Supreme Court. Joining with three conservatives already in place, these three were able to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that established a right to abortion nationwide.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs Trump's second term unfolds, the issues most likely to be vigorously pursued may be those where the interests of his populist base can be braided with those who sat in billionaire's row on Inauguration Day. Here the renewal of the 2017 tax cuts is an area of commonality, as is the promise to shrink government. But conflicts could arise over other potent parts of the 2024 agenda. There was friction over H1-B work visas that Trump's core populists consider anathema but that his backers in the tech world depend on. It was a battle between the Bannon and Musk wings of Trump's movement.\n\nBut in a sense Trump needs both wings in order to accomplish not only the government changes he has proposed but the full measure of retribution he seems to want. Musk may have already made his main contribution with the super PAC that pumped a reported $250 million into the Republican effort in 2024. Or he may be a war chest unto himself as the next phases of political wars arrive.\n\nWe may only be at the beginning of an era in which certain political figures can serve what are plausibly called populist causes by calling on the resources of the ultra-rich.",

            "content": "Unlike traditional methods of computation that rely on a Binary language, Quantum computers look to leverage quantum bits or \u2018qubits' instead. Unlike Binary, which is built atop 0 and 1, qubits can be superimposed \u2013 meaning they can exist simultaneously as 0 and 1, or anywhere in between. The result is a system that is able to perform certain types of computation at speeds magnitudes quicker than more traditional approaches. The ability to process vast amounts of data and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers is a key reason why Quantum computing is so important. Their unmatched performance means that such systems boast massive potential for advancements in fields like medicine, environmental science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Before its potential can be realized, there are a few significant hurdles that must first be cleared; namely, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental changes (making them error-prone) in addition to only being effective for specific algorithms. With that in mind, the following are a few publicly traded companies leading the way in the research and development of this game-changing approach to computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a notable name that has made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. For example, by using its \u2018127-qubit Eagle quantum computer', IBM has been able to solve complex problems that long stumped the leading classical methods. Despite the challenges of noise and errors in quantum systems, IBM was able to generate accurate results by using an \u2018advanced error mitigation' technique that were verified by running the problem on a traditional supercomputer for lower levels of complexity.\n\nIn the time since its Eagle quantum computer was released, IBM has already developed a 433 qubit system known as \u2018Osprey' and is expected to soon launch a 1,121 qubit system known as Condor. Each of these successive generations greatly improves upon its predecessor while widening the gap between what is possible with a traditional supercomputer. IBM states that,\n\n\u201cAs quantum processors scale up, each additional qubit doubles the amount of space complexity \u2014 the amount of memory space required to execute algorithms \u2014 for a classical computer to reliably simulate quantum circuits.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential abilities of a quantum computer cannot be replicated by more traditional approaches, IBM notes that it does not envision a future where only one exists. Rather, the company anticipates that both quantum and binary variants will continue to thrive in use cases geared specifically toward the strengths of each.\n\nLooking forward, IBM has already announced its next major goal in anticipation of its current quantum chips \u2018outgrowing' the currently used infrastructure. This goal is known as \u2018IBM Quantum System Two'; a modular system that has the potential to support up to 16,632 qubits.\n\nIBM Quantum System Two: Design Sneak Preview\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nIntel is a pioneer in silicon transistors for traditional computing. Whether a desktop or laptop, the chances are good that, regardless of PC form factor, you have utilized a computer powered by an Intel chip.\n\nAs we make our way through 2023, Intel has forged a clear, yet divergent, strategy for the future that involves quantum computing. Drawing upon its existing expertise, Intel is leveraging its expertise in high-volume transistor manufacturing to develop silicon spin qubits. For example, Intel has developed what it calls the \u2018Horse Ridge II cryogenic quantum control chip' that is said to enhance integration, while its \u2018cryoprobers' allow for high-volume testing.\n\nWorking alongside other companies determined to develop commercialized quantum computers, Intel is also doing its part to help. Currently, Intel boasts the \u2018Tunnel Falls' spin qubit chip as its most advanced offering to date and is, \u201c\u2026making the chip available to the quantum research community to spur advancements in the field.\u201d\n\nIntel Quantum Researchers Introduce Tunnel Falls Silicon Qubit Research Chip\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $138.89B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -157.14\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.68\n\nAt the time of writing, Intel boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nOperating out of Santa Barbara is \u2018Quantum AI' \u2013 an endeavor by Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google. The goal of Quantum AI is to, \u201c\u2026build scalable quantum computers that enable humankind to solve problems that would otherwise be impossible.\u201d\n\nBeyond developing the hardware, like the Sycamore processor, for its own take on a quantum computer, Google's Quantum AI also makes available a suite of software designed to assist scientists in the development of quantum algorithms.\n\nDemonstrating Quantum Error Correction\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.54T\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 22.74\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $4.49\n\nAt the time of writing, Alphabet boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nThe quantum computing division at Honeywell is a joint effort known as \u2018Quantinuum', which also involves Cambridge Quantum.\n\nIt is believed that Quantinuum continues to focus on increasing our understanding of \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. This technology involves utilizing ions trapped in a vacuum, which are then manipulated using lasers, allowing for the ions to behave as qubits.\n\nLike each of the companies listed above, Quantinuum is hoping that its design will allow for high precision, while simultaneously boasting error-correction capabilities \u2013 each crucial if quantum computers are ever to become commercially viable.\n\nIntroducing Quantinuum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $132.79B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 21.84\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $7.70\n\nAt the time of writing, Honeywell boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nWhile it may not have the same name recognition as IBM, Intel, and Alphabet, IonQ has still managed to establish itself as a significant player in the field of quantum computing.\n\nIonQ is known specifically for its research on \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. As previously stated, this is a method that leverages qubits comprised of individual ions suspended and manipulated within a vacuum.\n\nAs it stands, IonQ has reportedly developed quantum computers on par with the most powerful across the globe. In fact, its most recent offering is set to become the first of its kind to be utilized in a commercial setting. IonQ boasts that,\n\n\u201cOnce quantum computers are powerful and stable enough, their unique computational power will solve world-changing problems that are beyond the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers.\u201d\n\nThe company indicates that it hopes to achieve this goal through what it believes is a better approach (trapped ions), than those taken by many of its competitors.\n\nIonQ | The Age of Quantum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.92B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -27.56\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.36\n\nAt the time of writing, IonQ boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.",

The breakthrough sent shocks through global markets Monday, erasing nearly $1 trillion in U.S. and European tech stock value, including a record $589 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s NVDA market capitalization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks Inc., said to Bloomberg. \u201cThese models that can reason are so much cheaper to produce that you will see it be democratized. You\u2019ll see innovations from unexpected corners of the world.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s new o3 model, announced just before Christmas, signals a contrary trend\u2014achieving breakthrough performance but at staggering costs. The model requires up to $3,000 to solve a single query that humans complete in seconds, using 172 times more computing power than previous approaches.\n\n\u201cOne very important thing to understand about the future: the economics of AI are about to change completely,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an AI researcher, said on X when o3 went public.\n\nThe model\u2019s success came from its \u201ctest-time compute\u201d approach, allowing it to think harder about each question. While this produced superior results, including a 91.5% score on Chollet\u2019s challenging ARC test, it shattered previous cost assumptions about AI services.\n\nTrending: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nOpenAI, valued at $157 billion, may charge up to $2,000 monthly for full access to o3, according to The Economist, which cited New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu. Even the company\u2019s current \u201cpro\u201d version of o1 loses money on its $200 monthly subscription tier due to higher-than-expected usage.\n\nThe cost structure challenges the traditional tech industry model of providing services at near-zero marginal cost. It also strengthens the position of suppliers like Nvidia and cloud providers like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOG GOOGL)), which control the essential computing infrastructure.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s success suggests an alternative path. Founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, the company achieved its results through efficiency innovations and reinforcement learning techniques, despite limited access to advanced U.S. chips.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investing continues to be at the forefront of most investors' minds. There is a lot to come from this technology, and we've barely scratched the surface.\n\nOne AI stock that is fairly cheap right now is Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%), and it is one of my best stocks to buy right now. Even with what's going on in DeepSeek's R1 generative AI model, I still think Alphabet is an attractive purchase.\n\nAdvertising is still the largest part of Alphabet's business\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, so it doesn't necessarily have to win the generative AI arms race. This is important, as Alphabet's generative AI platform, Gemini, is normally listed near the top of the best generative AI models, although it isn't in first place.\n\nWhile Alphabet would love to have Gemini as the top generative AI platform, it doesn't need it to be. Alphabet's primary business is advertising, with 75% of its revenue coming from advertising sources in Q3. While Alphabet has spent time developing the Gemini model to be something that developers can build upon (which they have), the real strength of its model has been its integration with its various ad services.\n\nWith Gemini integrated into Google Ads, users can develop ad campaigns much faster that also adapt to individual consumers. This keeps Google at the top of the advertising game and ensures that clients will continue to come to them as a place to get a great return on advertising dollars spent.\n\nAlphabet also has Google Cloud, its cloud computing division. Many non-AI workloads have been built on Google Cloud alongside AI workloads. Cloud computing will continue to be a huge movement, as companies need access to the computing power to build their AI models and workloads.\n\nWhile clients may use Gemini or DeepSeek's R1 as a base language to build their platforms, they still need the computing power that a cloud computing provider has to run them continuously. As a result, Alphabet's cloud computing segment should still be primed for stronger growth.\n\nSo, even with the news of DeepSeek's R1 model being released, Alphabet is still positioned strongly to benefit from the AI arms race. Fortunately for investors, it's also on sale right now.\n\nAlphabet's stock doesn't trade at lofty levels like its peers\n\nLike some of its big tech peers, Alphabet never achieved a premium valuation. Right now, Alphabet's stock trades for 25 times trailing earnings and 21 times forward earnings.\n\nCompared to the S&P 500, which trades for 26 times trailing earnings and 22 times forward earnings, Alphabet trades at a slight discount. This is despite Alphabet having strong growth figures.\n\nIn Q3, Alphabet's revenue rose 15% year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) jumped from $1.55 to $2.12. Alphabet reports Q4 earnings on Feb. 4, and there may be some scrutiny and discussion about AI spending (because DeepSeek reportedly trained its AI model for under $6 million), but if Alphabet takes cues from DeepSeek and makes its model cheaper to train, that will only boost its earnings over the long run.\n\nAlphabet is still a top stock to buy, both for its AI platforms and its normal business. While the markets may be a bit bumpy right now, it's an excellent time to take advantage of it and scoop up some shares at an even bigger discount.",

            "content": "Positive news on autonomous vehicle builder Waymo and the long-range prospects for quantum computing have buoyed Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL). But the core internet search business is still top of mind for Google stock amid the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, ongoing antitrust lawsuits pursued by the Department of Justice hang over GOOGL stock.\n\nFourth quarter and full year earnings for Alphabet stock are due Feb. 4. Wall Street analysts project EPS growth of 29% to $2.12 with revenue growing 12% to $96.7 billion.\n\nAlso, Google's internet search advertising is expected to climb 11% to $53.29 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet. YouTube ad revenue will grow 11% to $10.24 billion, analysts predict. Meanwhile, cloud computing revenue is expected to grow 32% to $12.1 billion.\n\nAlphabet's new Chief Financial Officer, Anat Ashkenazi, is expected to lay out more of her priorities on the Q4 earnings call with analysts.\n\nMeta Platform's (META) Q4 results may bode well for Alphabet stock, said Bank of America analyst Justin Post in a report.\n\n\"We see Meta's Q4 ad revenue beat and e-commerce vertical commentary as positive read across for Google Q4 results,\" he said in a report. \"A channel check also indicated AI overview ads aided search pricing. We recently lowered our estimates for recent U.S. dollar appreciation, but with Meta not seeing a Q4 currency exchange rate impact and e-commerce ad spend strength, we think Google can beat street Q4 estimates.\"\n\nGoogle Stock: Innovation Leader\n\nWhether the internet giant is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nAlso, Google stock belongs to the IBD Leaderboard. But Alphabet continues to under-perform some Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nGOOGL stock popped 37% in 2024, though it pulled back from a high of 201.42 set on Dec. 17. So far in 2025, GOOGL stock has advanced 8%.\n\nIn 2025, analysts predict Google search advertising growth of nearly 10% to $216.5 billion.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said over 25% of new Google code is generated by artificial intelligence. Google's increasing reliance on AI tools for software development begs the question of whether workforce reductions will follow.\n\nGoogle Stock: Search Business Threatened\n\nGenerative AI startup OpenAI's ChatGPT continues to slowly gain market share. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries while Google's business model has been based on providing web links. Also, startup Perplexity is another new rival. Perplexity is seeking a merger with TikTok.\n\nGoogle is competing with OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META) and many others in building new foundation models. In December, Google unveiled its new artificial intelligence model, Gemini 2.0.\n\nGoogle began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. In late October, Google launched AI Overviews in 100 countries\n\nThe AI Overviews system uses Google's in-house Gemini AI model. Advertisers utilizing Gemini AI tools see increased traffic and click-through rates, especially among younger demographics, Google says.\n\nIn December, Google announced the Willow quantum computing chip. Google has been a leader in quantum research. But quantum technology faces challenges.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Waymo Expands\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo on Dec. 5 announced that the company plans to expand its autonomous vehicle rideshare service to Miami in 2026. The Waymo One robotaxi service currently operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with upcoming service already planned for Austin, Tex. and Atlanta. In Miami, Waymo will compete with Uber Technologies (UBER) and other rideshare services. In Austin and Atlanta, Waymo is partnering with Uber.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo also disclosed that it has reached 150,000 trips per week, rapid growth from August levels at 100,00 per week. Waymo is widely viewed as the leader in autonomous vehicles. In October, Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round, including Google and previous investors. If Wall Street analysts start including Waymo in Alphabet's valuation, it would be a big development.\n\nHowever, legal woes continue amid DoJ antitrust cases. Both Google's internet search and advertising businesses are under DoJ scrutiny.\n\nGoogle Stock: YouTube, TikTok\n\nAlso, analysts say GOOGL stock is getting a boost from the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory.\n\nAside from Google's core internet search advertising business, Wall Street analysts view growth at YouTube and cloud computing as key. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business, where it's battling Apple in smartphones.\n\nGoogle aims to slow down the growth of TikTok with its own short video platform. How much money Google generates from YouTube Shorts is a key issue for 2024, analysts say. YouTube Shorts now generates roughly 70 billion daily views.\n\nIn cloud computing, Google is still the third biggest service provider, behind Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft. Like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft' Azure business, Google's cloud unit has upped capital spending targeting the new opportunity in generative AI.\n\nGoogle's 2022 acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion seems to be paying dividends. Mandiant is part of Google's cloud-based cybersecurity services.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Is It A Buy Or Sell Now?\n\nAlphabet stock has turned in good and bad years recently. Shares jumped 65% in 2021 but in 2022 dropped 39%. Despite mounting competition in AI and internet search, Alphabet advanced 58% in 2023.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Rating of Google stock currently stands at 85 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.\n\nGoogle stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.\n\nFurther, shares hold an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nOn MarketSurge, GOOGL stock trades above a buy zone. And, long-time holders could take profits.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nAlphabet has an impressive earnings surprise history. GOOGL\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.84%.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement:\n\nProliferation of Gen AI to Boost Alphabet\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nThe search giant\u2019s to-be-reported quarterly results are expected to benefit from Android\u2019s strength and solid momentum in search and cloud businesses. Expanding generative AI (Gen AI) capabilities are likely to have been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to have more than offset concerns related to increasing regulatory headwinds.\n\n\n\nAlphabet has been cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using Gen AI models, is expected to have helped expand its clientele. Google\u2019s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy.\n\n\n\nThese tools are likely to have contributed well to top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAI Integration Aids GOOGL\u2019s Search Traffic Growth\n\nGOOGL continues to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support its AI efforts globally. It is leveraging AI to improve the coding process, and more than 25% of all new code at Google is currently generated by AI.\n\n\n\nThe integration of Gen AI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\n\n\n\nNew AI-powered enhancements, such as AI Overview, Circle to Search and advanced features in Lens, are improving user experience. AI Overview currently reaches more than 1 billion users monthly, and engagement levels are quite strong. The integration of ads within AI Overviews bodes well for Alphabet\u2019s monetization efforts.\n\n\n\nCircle to Search is now available on more than 150 million Android devices, with people using it to shop, translate text and learn more about the world around them. Lens has become the fastest-growing query type due to its ability to help in product discovery and shopping.\n\n\n\nAlphabet is leveraging AI and Gen AI to boost Pixel\u2019s features. The devices run on Google Tensor G4 chips, which help bring the Gemini Nano with Multimodality, Google\u2019s latest on-device AI model.\n\n\n\nAlphabet\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\n\nGrowing Cloud Business: A Key Catalyst for GOOGL\n\nAlphabet has been rapidly growing in the booming cloud computing market. Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Azure.\n\n\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is expected to have driven growth in the Google Cloud segment. Alphabet\u2019s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are expected to have been major positives.\n\n\n\nAlphabet is seeing strong demand due to an innovative AI infrastructure. GOOGL offers customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of NVIDIA NVDA GPUs and custom-built TPUs.\n\n\n\nEnterprise AI platform Vertex is gaining rapid adoption. Enterprises are combining Alphabet\u2019s AI platform with data platform BigQuery to make accurate real-time decisions. BigQuery machine learning operation saw 80% growth over the past six months, driven by this strong demand.\n\n\n\nIts strengthening Gen AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google Cloud\u2019s momentum among cloud customers in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nGOOGL Shares Beat Sector, Industry\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have appreciated 42.2% on a trailing 12-month basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Over the same timeframe, the sector and industry have returned 27.4% and 35.2%, respectively.\n\nGOOGL Stock\u2019s Performance\n\nGOOGL shares are overvalued, as suggested by Value Score C.\n\nCurrently, GOOGL is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.27X compared with the industry\u2019s 5.88X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M)\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGOOGL Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold Ahead of Q4?\n\nAlphabet\u2019s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver.\n\n\n\nA stretched valuation, increasing regulatory concerns and stiff competition in the cloud space make GOOGL shares risky for investors.\n\n\n\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues",

He said it's wise to refrain from sudden moves next week as there won't be enough time to digest such a large amount of information.\n\n\"When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands,\" he said. \"Because there's just too much data for any individual to process,\"\n\nPalantir is set to report Monday after close, and Cramer pointed out that the data company has been especially favored by the Pentagon as it helps companies and the government use resources more efficiently. He suggested it's likely the stock continues to climb, noting that some investors are fond of CEO Alex Karp.\n\nTuesday is packed with earnings reports. Cramer expects PayPal and Spotify to have great quarters. He noted that Spotify has a successful subscription model that usually helps top Wall Street estimates. Drug giants Merck and Pfizer will also release their numbers. Merck's could be good, he said, and if Pfizer can report positive news about its cancer dugs, that stock could run.\n\nPepsiCo and Chipotle also report on Tuesday. According to Cramer, the packaged food stocks have had a tough time since GLP-1 weight loss drugs became popular, especially PepsiCo, known for its soft drinks and snacks. He called the Mexican fast food chain a great growth stock in the restaurant sector and suggested now could be a chance to invest before shares move higher.\n\nPlus, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices have earnings are on deck Tuesday. Cramer said the Google parent's stock could rise if it reports solid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. He also wondered what AMD will have to say in the wake of breakthrough news from China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, which could make AMD's chips are more desirable.\n\nOn Wednesday are reports from Walt Disney , Novo Nordisk and Ford . Disney could be a buy before earnings, Cramer said, even as the fires in Los Angeles likely hurt the quarter. He said he'll be waiting to see how Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs are doing, and that Ford stock has been disappointing lately.\n\nThursday brings results from more drug stocks, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb , as well as Amazon. Cramer said he needs more details from Eli Lilly that suggest next year will be successful, and he's optimistic about Bristol Myers's new schizophrenia drug. Cramer added that he's expecting positive earnings from Amazon, but investors might want to wait until after it reports to buy the stock.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department will release the nonfarm payroll report, an inflation metric that's important to the Federal Reserve. If the data suggests strong growth in employment and wages, it may be unlikely the central bank will cut rates in the first half of the year, Cramer said.",

Analysts expect Alphabet to meet or exceed expectations, with revenue projected at $81.5 billion and earnings per share at $2.12.\n\nBank of America analysts highlighted that search ad pricing benefited from AI-generated overview ads, contributing to potential growth. YouTube is also expected to have gained from improved AI-driven ad targeting, while Google Cloud could see a modest upside following Microsoft Azure's weaker-than-expected results. However, they cautioned that risks are tied to foreign exchange headwinds, tougher first-quarter ad comparisons, and potential margin pressure from increased hiring or capital expenditures.\n\nWith Alphabet's new chief financial officer in place, analysts expect additional cost-cutting measures and potential new disclosures regarding capital expenditures. They also pointed to regulatory developments, including the possibility of a settlement with the Department of Justice following Judge Mehta's ruling later this year. Bank of America remains constructive on the company's long-term AI monetization potential.\n\nAt its current valuation of approximately 20 times projected 2026 GAAP earnings, analysts see the stock as attractive compared to the S&P 500. Alphabet has historically traded at a premium to the index and analysts believe that the market may be underestimating the potential for AI-driven search monetization in 2025.\n\nGOOG Price Action: Alphabet\u2019s shares were up 1.80% at $206.28 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks were moving higher today as earnings season kicked into full swing and as investors continue to digest the impact of DeepSeek on the AI sector. The Nasdaq Composite and broader benchmark S&P 500 index were modestly higher as of 1:40 p.m. ET today.\n\nShares of AI giants Broadcom (AVGO -3.56%) had moved roughly 4.5% as of 2 p.m. ET, while shares of Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%) had risen about 2.5%. Meanwhile, shares of Marvell Technologies (MRVL -4.51%) were up nearly 3%.\n\nA big assist from Meta\n\nMeta Platforms reported its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closed yesterday, soundly beating analyst estimates. Earnings per share of $8.02 crushed the Street's consensus estimate of $6.76, while revenue came in $1.4 billion higher than expected.\n\nHowever, Meta's results also came with a nice surprise for Broadcom. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call with analysts that the company would spend hundreds of billions on artificial intelligence. Additionally, Meta CFO Susan Li also said, \"We're pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) silicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads.\" Meta built its MTIA chips with Broadcom, so investors see this announcement as very bullish for the company.\n\nIn potentially other good news for Broadcom, The Wall Street Journal reported late last night that SoftBank is contemplating a $15 billion to $25 billion investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Broadcom in December said it had recently won deals to develop next-generation semiconductor chips for two new companies and analysts think one is OpenAI, so the WSJ report looks like more good news.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting today after two analysts raised their price targets on the company this morning. Analysts at Bernstein increased their price target on the stock from $185 to $210 and maintained a market perform rating on the stock. The analysts believe that Google Search and YouTube will continue to grow nicely, while Alphabet's cloud services group can potentially turn the company into a winner in the AI space.\n\nAlphabet also caught a price target bump from Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who increased his target by $10 to $215 and maintained an outperform rating on the shares. Helfstein said that Meta's results pave a favorable path for when Alphabet reports earnings next week. He thinks more investors might buy the stock as the company's AI picture becomes more clear and if investors start to question Meta's revenue outlook.\n\nWhile there was no specific news from Marvell, it appears to be moving for the same reasons as Broadcom. Meta's announcement supports the thesis that tech giants could look to create more tailored chips to meet their AI infrastructure needs. Marvell already does this for some of the biggest tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nEarnings reports keep investors interested in AI\n\nAfter a big sell-off earlier this week due to the emergence of DeepSeek, earnings reports are keeping investors interested in the AI trade. I think the emergence of DeepSeek has only created more questions about whether AI companies can sustain their elevated valuations, so I am still concerned that these stocks face a high threshold to keep the momentum going.\n\nOf these three stocks -- Broadcom, Alphabet, and Marvell -- I am most interested in Alphabet, one of the cheaper names in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Alphabet has struggled more than peers due to a lawsuit from the Department of Justice that could ultimately force the company to sell its Chrome browser. But I think this outcome is unlikely, and I like the fact that analysts believe the market has yet to fully price in the value of Alphabet's AI businesses.",

Analysts forecast revenues of $81.38 billion, representing an increase of 12.5% year over year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Alphabet metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenues- Google properties' of $63.43 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.9%.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenues- Google Cloud' will likely reach $12.14 billion. The estimate points to a change of +32.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- YouTube ads' to come in at $10.16 billion. The estimate points to a change of +10.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Google advertising' reaching $71.62 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +9.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenues- Google Search & other' will reach $53.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +10.7% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- Google Network' should come in at $7.84 billion. The estimate points to a change of -5.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- EMEA' stands at $27.81 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.2%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- United States' will reach $47.26 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +12.5% year over year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America)' should arrive at $5.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory Continues",

( GOOGL ) has evolved from a search-engine giant into a diversified technology conglomerate spanning cloud computing, digital advertising, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. It dominates the online search market with over 94% share, benefiting from increasing search queries and advertiser activity. The company is also expanding its presence in cloud computing through Google Cloud and strengthening its position in autonomous vehicles with Waymo.\n\nShares of the internet search leader have outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. GOOGL has rallied 32.6% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has gained 23.3% . On a YTD basis, shares of GOOGL are up 6.1%, compared to SPX\u2019s 3.3% gain.\n\nFocusing more closely, the Mountain View, California-based company has slightly outpaced the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund\u2019s ( XLC ) 32.3% return over the past 52 weeks.\n\nShares of Alphabet rose 2.8% following its Q3 earnings release on Oct. 29, driven by a 35% surge in its cloud business, which reached $11.4 billion. The company also exceeded profit expectations with earnings of $2.12 per share. YouTube ad revenue was boosted by election-related spending, contributing to a 10% increase in Alphabet's digital advertising sales, totaling $65.9 billion. Additionally, Alphabet's total revenue for the quarter grew 15% to $88.3 billion, above analysts' expectations.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, which ended in December, analysts expect GOOGL\u2019s EPS to grow 38.3% year-over-year to $8.02 . The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 50 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 39 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, three \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and eight \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 30, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein raised Alphabet's price target to $225 , maintaining an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating, citing strong advertising trends and the positive impact of generative AI on ad prices. The firm also highlighted that Alphabet could become a more attractive alternative to Meta if investors have concerns about Meta's revenue outlook or EPS growth through 2025.\n\nThe mean price target of $217.35 represents a premium of nearly 9% to GOOGL's current levels. The Street-high price target of $240, implies a potential upside of 20.4% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Sultan Mahmud II holds a pivotal place in the history of Turkish modernization. He approached modernization not merely as a military endeavor but also as a means to build a new identity for society across various layers of life. Among his initiatives, the introduction of the fez stands out. The fez symbolized an attempt to create an Ottoman identity that transcended religion and fostered a sense of homogeneity. It remained a prominent feature of Ottoman identity until the last days of the empire, only to be banned during the clothing reform in the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye. Even today, the fez is still used in some of the former territories of the Ottoman Empire, reflecting its enduring cultural significance.\n\nRed fez with black tassel. (Shutterstock Photo)\n\nThe production of the fez was an industrial process centered in a building called Feshane. After the abolition of the Janissary Corps, the new army adopted the fez as part of its uniform, marking it as an essential element of Turkish modernization. Feshane, commissioned by Sultan Mahmud II, now serves as an arts center. Currently, it houses Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s installation \"Lost Alphabet.\" The exhibition, which spans multiple layers of meaning, is supported by Y\u0131ld\u0131z Holding, whose chairman of the board, Murat \u00dclker, has shown particular interest in G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s works. \u00dclker\u2019s engagement with art spans various disciplines, as he has followed the works of prominent Turkish contemporary artists such as Burhan Do\u011fan\u00e7ay and Bedri Baykam, reflecting his observation of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s broader cultural pursuits and searches.\n\nG\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s artistic journey is deeply rooted in his heritage, including the cultural influences of his grandmother, who was a Yazidi and later converted to Islam. The Yazidis\u2019 reverence for the sun is a recurring motif in his work, which explores the interplay of identity, memory and cultural depth. His installation \"Lost Alphabet\" provokes important questions about T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ongoing efforts to foster societal harmony. By inviting audiences to reflect on what might be considered the \u201clost alphabets\u201d of cultural memory, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s work underscores the challenges and possibilities of building a cohesive and inclusive cultural identity.\n\nOne of G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s other notable installations in T\u00fcrkiye was titled \"The City of Names: Istanbul,\" showcased at Galataport, where major cruise ships dock. Istanbul has been called many names over the centuries, one of which is Miklagard, meaning \u201cGreat City\u201d in Old Norse, a name given by Viking travelers. Today, the name lingers in the form of a restaurant called Mikla, reflecting Istanbul\u2019s many layers of cultural history. The city\u2019s Viking heritage is also visible in the graffiti left by Viking soldiers on the walls of Hagia Sophia, a lasting testament to the city\u2019s deep cultural layers. The installation featured circular forms resembling the sun, containing various names of Istanbul. It also included ancient coins and inscriptions in different languages, highlighting the diverse names attributed to the city throughout history. I had the opportunity to hear the story behind this work from one of its curators, the esteemed Hasan Mert Kaya.\n\nAn artwork titled \"Sarcophaguses of Alphabet\" by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. (Courtesy of Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin)\n\nNear Galataport, the Nusretiye Mosque \u2013 \"nusret\" means divine help, specifically God\u2019s aid \u2013 was another creation of Sultan Mahmud II that further exemplifies his legacy. Built as a \u201cVictory Mosque,\u201d it stands next to the Tophane, where Ottoman cannons were once forged. The mosque was constructed during a period of cultural transition and served as a political response to rumors of religious estrangement following the fez\u2019s introduction. It signified a deliberate effort to balance cultural change with religious symbolism, emphasizing the intertwining of tradition and modernization.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ongoing culture war can be understood as an expression of the country\u2019s effort to build a bridge between its past and future. The repurposing of industrial buildings from the Ottoman period \u2013 especially those with military significance \u2013 into cultural institutions today carries a deep sense of irony. These transformations symbolize the country\u2019s broader struggle to reconcile its historical legacy with its aspirations for modernity. The importance of turning cultural wars into cultural peace becomes increasingly evident. This transformation, however, is only possible by answering the profound questions posed by art and culture. Through these answers, a peaceful dialogue between differing cultural perspectives can emerge, fostering greater understanding and cohesion.\n\nToday, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s installations in the shadow of Sultan Mahmud II invite us to question the meaning of our lost alphabets and cultural memories. Art, as seen in these examples, does not merely provide answers but inspires new questions, encouraging us to open more space for creativity in our daily lives. Perhaps this is the key to better understanding our shared heritage and the path forward, where culture serves as a bridge rather than a battleground.",

Each one of these executives has had their company\u2019s relationship with the Trump administration evolve over time. During Trump\u2019s first term, it was popular in Silicon Valley to be in opposition to Trump, take stances publicly, and introduce policies internally that reflected that opposing view. Fast forward to now, and the narrative in tech has switched to building a relationship with Trump and his administration. In this piece, I will touch on how each of these executives\u2019 companies has evolved their position with Trump over the past 8 years and what that means for the tech industry.\n\nSundar Pichai, the current CEO of Alphabet, which owns Google, YouTube, Waymo, and a slew of other innovations, was in attendance at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Pichai became CEO of Google in 2015 and then CEO of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet Inc., in 2019. He has championed diversity and inclusion throughout his time as CEO even going as far as firing a former Google employee named James Damore who wrote a 10-page manifesto against the diversity and inclusion policies at the company titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d Pichai had also made statements publicly during Trump\u2019s first term that denounced his executive order aimed at curtailing immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. When this happened, Pichai and one of Google\u2019s co-founders Sergey Brin gave a speech to over 2,000 Googlers that collectively raised $4 million to support groups working on refugee and immigrant rights. So when he was seen at Trump\u2019s second-term inauguration that may have surprised people given his previous commitments to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, not to mention his being pro-immigration as an immigrant from India himself. While some executives in attendance have publicly stated their company\u2019s stance on DEI going forward, we have not heard anything from Pichai and Alphabet as of yet. I believe that we will not see Pichai roll back DEI efforts in the coming months. However, some may speculate he will reduce initiatives because of the conservative-leaning Supreme Court scoring the company a win against the 17 states that filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. The plaintiffs claim the tech giant\u2019s dominance over digital advertising makes it an illegal monopoly.\n\nJeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was also in attendance at Trump\u2019s inauguration after leaving Amazon\u2019s CEO seat in July 2021 to longtime Amazon veteran Andy Jassy who currently leads the company. Bezos\u2019 relationship with Trump has evolved over time from one that was once adversarial to one that seems more cordial in recent years. During Trump\u2019s first campaign, Bezos was critical of his behavior to the point that while at a Vanity Fair event in 2016 where he was being recognized for innovative work, he said that Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cerodes democracy around the edges.\u201d So it was surprising to see Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, blocked the paper from endorsing Kamala Harris in the most recent presidential election. This move by Bezos caused 200,000 subscribers to cancel their subscriptions. In recent weeks, he was seen having dinner with President Trump and Elon Musk at Mar-a-lago.\n\nWhile Pichai has not said anything publicly and Bezos appears to try to be neutral, Zuckerberg, Musk, and Cook have stated publicly how their companies will move forward during Trump\u2019s administration. At Meta, the company has chosen to roll back specific commitments around DEI as it relates to content moderation on the platform and hiring practices. Musk has long been connected to the Trump administration and was one of his biggest donors and supporters during his campaign. Musk has been rewarded with the task of leading a new governmental entity called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE for short. Cook stands alone for being in attendance but not changing Apple\u2019s previous commitments to diversity. The company\u2019s board has asked shareholders to reject a proposal submitted by conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy and Research to cut back on its DEI efforts.\n\nValues are not values unless they have the potential to cost you something. As we can see, some executives look to have their companies reflect their values even if they have to use time and money to defend them, while others are choosing the path of least resistance. Given the different relationship that each exec has with Trump and his policies, I do not believe that we are seeing a tech oligarchy form but instead will see tech leaders having a much bigger role in the federal government than with previous administrations. This may cascade down to state and federal governments and how they view their relationship with the tech leaders in their regions. We may even see states and cities inviting more of them to the table to help improve their communities. Technology and policy are intersecting in ways they had not in years prior, so to plan for how this may impact your career in the future, it\u2019s best to see how changes in technology may influence policy moving forward.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "One of these companies' quantum platforms can complete calculations in minutes that would take today's supercomputers longer than the age of the universe to solve.\n\nQuantum computing may be the next sector to see share prices surge. Pure-play quantum computing company IonQ (IONQ -5.96%) is an example. Its shares skyrocketed 270% over the past 12 months through the week ending Jan. 24.\n\nAlong with IonQ, another quantum computer stock to consider is Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%). The conglomerate added quantum computing to its tech bets back in 2006, and possesses the deep financial pockets to see it succeed.\n\nWhich company, Alphabet or IonQ, presents a better long-term investment opportunity in the nascent quantum computing sector?\n\nA look at IonQ's technology\n\nSuccess in the quantum computing field depends on how effectively a technology can harness the subatomic particles used in making calculations. IonQ solves some of the main challenges with quantum computers today.\n\nFor starters, IonQ's tech can operate at room temperature. Typically, quantum computers require temperatures colder than deep space to minimize calculation errors.\n\nError rates are another challenge with quantum machines. Calculations must be checked and errors corrected for the tech to produce useful results, making quantum systems difficult to scale.\n\nIonQ's technology delivers 99.9% accuracy. Moreover, last year, the company unveiled a new process to correct errors that is up to thousands of times more efficient than its competitors.\n\nIt's also building a quantum computer network by connecting quantum machines together, a feat that is the first of its kind according to the company.\n\nIonQ's tech led to capturing customers, such as AstraZeneca, which is using it to develop new medicines. The U.S. Air Force, Hyundai Motors, and Airbus are also among IonQ's clientele.\n\nIts customer acquisitions helped the company reach $12.4 million in third-quarter sales, a 102% year-over-year increase. IonQ expects to wrap up 2024 with full-year revenue of at least $38.5 million, which would be a 75% jump from 2023's $22 million.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is probably best known for its Google search engine and digital advertising businesses, and these cash cows supply the funds to invest in quantum computing. To give a sense for how much financial firepower it can bring to bear, Alphabet generated free cash flow (FCF) of $17.6 billion in Q3. FCF indicates the money available for a company to invest in its business, reduce debt, pay dividends, and repurchase shares.\n\nIn December, Alphabet released its new quantum chip, Willow. This chip completed a calculation in five minutes that would take the world's most powerful supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, which is longer than the age of the universe.\n\nWillow also possesses the ability to reduce errors as it scales up. This is impressive since errors usually increase with scale. Willow can do this because it can correct computational mistakes in real time.\n\nCurrently, Willow is in the prototype phase, so it isn't available for commercial use. However, when Alphabet is ready to provide widespread access to its quantum machines, it's positioned to do so.\n\nThat's because the company also operates Google Cloud, a successful cloud computing business. This division grew Q3 revenue by 35% year over year to $11.4 billion. Alphabet already deployed its quantum computing services to a handful of pilot customers through Google Cloud. Currently, IonQ must pay Alphabet and other cloud vendors to do the same.\n\nDeciding between IonQ and Alphabet stocks\n\nIonQ has a head start on Alphabet in terms of commercial use of its quantum computers, since Alphabet is limiting access. That doesn't mean IonQ's lead is secure.\n\nAlphabet has billions of dollars at its disposal, while IonQ is currently not profitable, posting a net loss of $52.5 million in Q3. For reference, Alphabet exited Q3 with net income of $26.3 billion.\n\nHowever, Alphabet lost an antitrust case last year regarding its Google search business. The court hasn't ruled on a punishment yet although that's expected later this year. Alphabet is also awaiting an outcome in another antitrust case regarding its advertising business.\n\nThis means investing in Alphabet carries some risk, depending on the final impact of the antitrust cases to Google's business. That said, IonQ stock holds risk as well, because the company's only source of revenue is its quantum computing tech.\n\nGiven the risks, which is the better quantum computing stock? The answer is Alphabet. The specter of the antitrust cases hangs over the company, but according to CEO Sundar Pichai, it could take years to resolve, since Alphabet can appeal an unfavorable ruling.\n\nAnother consideration is that it will likely be years before quantum computers are scalable enough for widespread use. Some forecasts estimate that won't happen until beyond 2040.\n\nWith potentially decades before quantum computers reach mass usage, Alphabet's financial strength comes into play here. It can afford to invest in its quantum division without needing the tech to produce revenue while IonQ's survival depends on continued sales growth.\n\nThese factors give Alphabet the edge over IonQ as the better long-term investment in the budding field of quantum computing.",

The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period.\n\nIn other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President\u2019s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market\u2019s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets.

He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they\u2019re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company.\n\nBailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm\u2019s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery.\n\nStory Continues",

Moreover, last year, the company unveiled a new process to correct errors that is up to thousands of times more efficient than its competitors.\n\nIt's also building a quantum computer network by connecting quantum machines together, a feat that is the first of its kind according to the company.\n\nIonQ's tech led to capturing customers, such as AstraZeneca, which is using it to develop new medicines. The U.S. Air Force, Hyundai Motors, and Airbus are also among IonQ's clientele.\n\nIts customer acquisitions helped the company reach $12.4 million in third-quarter sales, a 102% year-over-year increase. IonQ expects to wrap up 2024 with full-year revenue of at least $38.5 million, which would be a 75% jump from 2023's $22 million.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is probably best known for its Google search engine and digital advertising businesses, and these cash cows supply the funds to invest in quantum computing. To give a sense for how much financial firepower it can bring to bear, Alphabet generated free cash flow (FCF) of $17.6 billion in Q3. FCF indicates the money available for a company to invest in its business, reduce debt, pay dividends, and repurchase shares.\n\nIn December, Alphabet released its new quantum chip, Willow. This chip completed a calculation in five minutes that would take the world's most powerful supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, which is longer than the age of the universe.\n\nWillow also possesses the ability to reduce errors as it scales up. This is impressive since errors usually increase with scale. Willow can do this because it can correct computational mistakes in real time.\n\nCurrently, Willow is in the prototype phase, so it isn't available for commercial use. However, when Alphabet is ready to provide widespread access to its quantum machines, it's positioned to do so.\n\nThat's because the company also operates Google Cloud, a successful cloud computing business. This division grew Q3 revenue by 35% year over year to $11.4 billion. Alphabet already deployed its quantum computing services to a handful of pilot customers through Google Cloud. Currently, IonQ must pay Alphabet and other cloud vendors to do the same.\n\nDeciding between IonQ and Alphabet stocks\n\nIonQ has a head start on Alphabet in terms of commercial use of its quantum computers, since Alphabet is limiting access. That doesn't mean IonQ's lead is secure.\n\nAlphabet has billions of dollars at its disposal, while IonQ is currently not profitable, posting a net loss of $52.5 million in Q3. For reference, Alphabet exited Q3 with net income of $26.3 billion.\n\nHowever, Alphabet lost an antitrust case last year regarding its Google search business. The court hasn't ruled on a punishment yet although that's expected later this year. Alphabet is also awaiting an outcome in another antitrust case regarding its advertising business.\n\nThis means investing in Alphabet carries some risk, depending on the final impact of the antitrust cases to Google's business. That said, IonQ stock holds risk as well, because the company's only source of revenue is its quantum computing tech.\n\nGiven the risks, which is the better quantum computing stock? The answer is Alphabet. The specter of the antitrust cases hangs over the company, but according to CEO Sundar Pichai, it could take years to resolve, since Alphabet can appeal an unfavorable ruling.\n\nAnother consideration is that it will likely be years before quantum computers are scalable enough for widespread use. Some forecasts estimate that won't happen until beyond 2040.\n\nWith potentially decades before quantum computers reach mass usage, Alphabet's financial strength comes into play here. It can afford to invest in its quantum division without needing the tech to produce revenue while IonQ's survival depends on continued sales growth.\n\nThese factors give Alphabet the edge over IonQ as the better long-term investment in the budding field of quantum computing.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It straddles multiple aspects of online activity including the search engine, its Gmail service and a large slice of the smartphone market via its Android operating system.\n\nIt is also at the cutting edge of two emerging technologies which are set to change the world in profound ways, artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.\n\nShares in Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet have performed well in recent years and there are reasons to believe they will continue to, although nothing is guaranteed with investing.\n\nRead more: Should I buy Tesla shares?\n\nThis article covers:\n\nHow does Google make money?\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company Alphabet makes a large proportion of its money by selling targeted advertisements to run alongside its search engine results and YouTube videos.\n\nIt also makes a considerable sum from cloud computing. These include its widely used gmail service, and Google Cloud Platform which offers a plethora of data crunching, storage and machine-learning services.\n\nThe firm is in the early stages of monetising its AI technology development, although this is an area much more tied to potential future revenue than present. Google has its own large-language model series called Gemini, which directly competes with Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAnother exciting field of technology the company is at the forefront of is quantum computing. This is a new kind of computer which is many orders of magnitude more powerful than conventional computers. Quantum computers are believed to be able to perform complex calculations that would normally take billions of years in just minutes. Needless to say, successfully commercialising this technology could be a game changer.\n\nIn recent years, Google has also significantly stepped up its device production. The Pixel smartphone range and Google Watch line now directly compete with long-time market leader Apple\u2019s offerings.\n\nHow have Google (Alphabet) shares performed?\n\nAlphabet shares have seen a stellar rise in recent years. The company was one of the big beneficiaries from the pandemic era stock market rally and, following a fall back during the period of high inflation and rising interest rates, has had a great 2024.\n\nAs of January 2025, Alphabet shares are trading at approximately $194. Over one year this represents a 45% rise, while over five years they are up 190%.\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\nRead more: Should I buy Meta shares? How to profit from Instagram and Facebook without being an \u2018influencer\u2019\n\nWhat are the pros of buying Google shares?\n\nGoogle\u2019s dominant position in internet search and online advertising put it in an extremely strong position that competitors would find it hard to unseat it from. For investors this adds a measure of security and reassurance that it is more than capable of maintaining its position at the forefront of its main business lines.\n\nPotentially more exciting for investors is Google\u2019s place at the forefront of cloud computing and AI. These are the areas where it has most of its growth potential. As each year goes by, more data crunching and tech activity is being drawn into the cloud rather than being done on local computers.\n\nOn the AI front, Google is offering fierce competition to the likes of OpenAI. It owns cutting edge AI development firm Deepmind, and already offers a range of AI tools including its Gemini large language models (LLMs) and Imagen image creation service.\n\nCold, hard cash is another significant plus point. Alphabet is sitting on about $100bn in liquidity. This gives it vast scope to invest in growth of its current businesses and branch out in to new ones.\n\nIt also leaves the door wide open to generous dividend payouts to shareholders and large-scale stock buy-backs, which are two things most investors love to see.\n\nRead more: What is an IPO and how can I invest in one?\n\nWhat are the possible cons of buying Google shares?\n\nGoogle\u2019s firm grip on the internet search market is a double-edged sword to some degree. This is because it has prompted concerns among regulators on both sides of the Atlantic that it may have too much power and market share.\n\nOne of the principal jobs for regulators of companies is to ensure they do not create monopolies and stifle competitors. Googles\u2019 dominance of search and online advertising is therefore a concern.\n\nIn the US, the competition watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission, has opened an investigation into Alphabet over competition concerns that could theoretically lead to it being forced to sell off some parts of its business.\n\nThe company has also had run-ins with the EU and UK competitions authorities that in some cases have ended in substantial fines. Most recently, the EU fined Google \u20ac1.5bn; however Google successfully appealed against the decision.\n\nInvestigations and potential fines create uncertainty for investors and have the potential to harm the share price. Fines would need to be extremely high, though, to have a notable impact given the company\u2019s vast resources.\n\nA related vulnerability is the potential for rival companies to begin taking market share from Alphabet in its key areas of business. There is little sign of this yet but this is the aim of the regulators to a degree, so it cannot be ruled out.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that online advertising revenues can be volatile, even for the market leader. They are closely tied to the performance of the US and global economy and consumer confidence. Any signs of a fall in online advertisement sales could send Alphabet\u2019s share price down.\n\nRead more: What are ETFs and are they a good investment?\n\nA stock analyst\u2019s view\n\nMorningstar equity analyst Malik Ahmed Khan provided the following assessment of the regulatory issues Google is facing in a recent research note:\n\n\u201cWe are maintaining our $209 fair value estimate for wide-moat Alphabet after the Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, the antitrust regulator in the UK, provisionally found that Google used anticompetitive practices in the ad-tech space.\n\n\u201cThe allegations that the CMA has made against Google\u2019s monopolistic behaviour in the ad-tech space are quite similar to those made by the Federal Trade Commission in its ongoing ad-tech monopoly case against Google that also alleges the firm has engaged in monopolistic behaviour in the ad-tech market.\n\n\u201cWe previously noted that while the antitrust challenges are plentiful for Alphabet, we think investor concerns around the potential damage to Alphabet\u2019s business due to these antitrust cases are overblown. To that end, we reiterate two key points related to not only the ad-tech antitrust case but also the Google Play and Google Search antitrust cases against Alphabet.\n\n\u201cOne, it is important to keep timelines in mind when thinking about antitrust enforcement. For example, the CMA\u2019s own timeline for its ad-tech investigation suggests that it could take more than a year for Google to articulate its objections to the CMA case against it before the CMA makes a final decision on the matter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we don\u2019t expect the Google Search antitrust case to result in meaningful penalties/remedies for at least another couple of years, giving Alphabet plenty of time to take remedial actions while also diversifying into other business areas such as YouTube and Google Cloud Platform.\u201d\n\nRead more: Why do interest rates affect the stock market?\n\nHow to buy Google shares\n\nBuying shares in Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is straightforward once you have an account with an online investment platform.\n\nShares in US-listed companies are available on UK investment platforms. Declaration forms to confirm you are not a US taxpayer may be required, but only the first time you buy. While Alphabet is the name of the listing, the ticker attached to the shares is actually GOOGL (without the e).\n\nUS shares can be held in an Isa tax-free wrapper or a Sipp in the same way as UK shares. One thing to keep in mind is that they will be priced in US dollars, although platforms will also show you the sterling value in many cases.\n\nThematic ETFs are another option. Products which target investing themes such as cloud computing, digital commerce and AI may have significant exposure to Alphabet. You will need to identify the underlying holdings in the ETF to establish this before investing.\n\nA third option is to buy into an actively-managed equities fund or investment trust which holds Alphabet. The largest holdings of most funds and trusts are public, so you can find good candidates by doing some research.\n\nAs with tracker funds, this would not be equivalent to a direct investment in Alphabet but some active funds will have large holdings of shares in the company, so they could give you some exposure.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in European stocks?",

            "content": "It\u2019s called Molecular Typography\u2014and it\u2019s experimental work by Kobi Franco, a leader in the master\u2019s design program at Shenkar College in Tel Aviv. His extensive research has been collected into a deceivingly stylish book titled Molecular Typography Laboratory (Slanted), which explores the speculative premise that the characters of the Hebrew and Latin alphabets possess a molecular structure. Over 150 distinct experiments were conducted on the topic, categorized into 11 primary themes in the book: Foundations, Language, Gender, Formula, Weight, Gravity, 3D, Generative Research, Color, Word Play, and Type and Image.\n\nSince I failed my chemistry and physical science courses in school, I asked Franco to give me a detailed remedial accounting of his fascinating work in short bits that I could understand. Thank you, Kobi, for your patience.\n\nPlease explain your experiments\u2014and tell me how you would define Molecular Typography.\n\nI first encountered the [term] \u201cmolecular typography\u201d while randomly surfing the internet. The search led me to a short video titled \u201cUnderstanding Molecular Typography,\u201d which documented a lecture by the American designer and artist Woody Leslie. Leslie presents a book by the philologist and scholar H.F. Henderson, which argues that the letters of the Latin alphabet are based on a molecular structure, meaning each letter is composed of a combination of several atoms. Henderson suggests that future research in other languages would yield additional atoms or new insights, potentially catalyzing a revolution in this field. \u201cUnderstanding Molecular Typography\u201d was later revealed to be an artistic project, a figment of Leslie\u2019s imagination. Nevertheless, I became enchanted by the speculative process of thinking about a Hebrew alphabet composed of similar yet different \u201catoms.\u201d I embarked on a journey\u2014an experimental, pseudo-scientific study based on the assumption that the Hebrew letters indeed had a molecular structure. I sought to explore how this assumption could be applied to the Hebrew alphabet, Hebrew words, and the Hebrew language.\n\nThe molecular principles are straightforward: a limited number of atoms, or basic shapes, connect to one another through electromagnetic attraction, forming all the letters of the alphabet. Leslie based his study on the Futura typeface (1927), designed by Paul Renner, and broke it down into seven atoms. In my laboratory, I chose to work with the Va\u2019ad typeface (2005), which I developed based on letters designed by Ze\u2019ev Raban (1890\u20131970), one of the pioneers of Israeli art in the mid-20th century. The Va\u2019ad typeface was deconstructed into six variously sized atoms, designed on the basis of a square grid and tagged with the Latin letters: square=D, horizontal rectangle=E, short vertical rectangle=J, long vertical rectangle=I, parallelogram tilted to the right=K, and parallelogram tilted to the left=V. Each letter in the Latin and Hebrew alphabets is composed of combinations of two to 11 atoms. The combinations of atoms that make up the letters are arranged as though composing a chemical formula. In this way, the first Hebrew letter, Aleph\u2014composed of four squares, a short vertical rectangle, a parallelogram tilted to the right, and a parallelogram tilted to the left\u2014is represented by the formula D4JKV. Each atom is surrounded by a fixed electric charge that causes an electromagnetic interaction. The combination of atoms into letters parallels the combination of letters into words. The atoms are 3D units, and their combination forms letters or 3D signs.\n\nThe work that comes from your experiments addresses the legibility, accessibility and emotional qualities of type. Would you say this is an accurate description?\n\nYes, that is indeed an accurate description. The Molecular Typography Laboratory is a speculative research project that explores experimental typography along the axes of function versus aesthetics and content versus form. It includes a series of tests\u2014a system of \u201cgames\u201d for which I determine the rules, set the game board, and decide on the players. The tests present the results of each game. Using a method that combines several basic shapes, the Hebrew and Latin alphabets were constructed, resulting in the design of a typeface. The project presents visual, conceptual and potential structural applications for this typeface.\n\nIn his essay \u201cWord-Covenant,\u201d Ori Drumer, cultural critic and psychotherapist, says: \u201cIn Franco\u2019s laboratory, letters function as an extension of the researcher\u2019s body. The artist\u2019s book and the accompanying research project provoke further thought, curiosity and imagination, and their exploration is accompanied by a desire to decipher and name the letter images functioning as body parts. Franco presents a unique visual language, a spectacle of complex relations with the letters, which he puts to various uses. Removed from their familiar context, in which they function as signs, the letters are subjected to unusual typographic processes, so that they become images charged with meaning. For Franco, the letters are not only morphological signs, while the laboratory under\u00admines the arbitrary character of the sign. Franco plays with the conventional linguistic mechanism that arbitrarily ties together sign, signifier and signified, undoing the connection between letter and representation to create a personal interpretation and a new structural logic that is highly personal. The result is a private, symbolic typography, which nevertheless has meaning and content in the actual world.\u201d\n\nYour work, as I understand it, is at the nexus of type and poetry. How would you describe your process?\n\nIt can definitely be said that poetry, or the use of poetry, appears quite frequently in the project. My research has been deeply influenced by the creative activity and self-imposed writing constraints formulated by the members of the OuLiPo group\u2014a circle of mostly French writers, poets and mathematicians founded in 1960. The group\u2019s purpose was to create new literary structures and models by imposing various constraints or algorithms. \u201cNecessity is the mother of invention,\u201d or, in the words of group member Georges Perec, it functions as \u201ca machine for stories.\u201d Existing literary forms, such as the lipogram and palindrome, as well as new forms invented by the group, were largely based on mathematical equations. This reliance on constraint initially appeared to be a spectacular tool, but in fact, it stemmed from the belief that linguistic constraints liberate consciousness and give rise to new and original ideas.\n\nThe use of linguistic templates such as the anagram, palindrome and pangram accelerates a form\u2019s capacity to add to verbal content, camouflage it, and act as crude visual matter. My own tests have examined the formal, aesthetic and symmetrical appearance of letters and words, in the spirit of post-structuralist interpretation, which views the text as a weave of interrelated signs in an expanding network of meanings. Derrida himself noted the etymological connection between \u201ctext\u201d and \u201ctexture,\u201d conceiving of a text whose materiality resembles that of a cloth. Another source of inspiration was the Symbolist poets of the 19th century, including Arthur Rimbaud, who sought to apply rules to madness and ascribe colors to letters, and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, whose poem A Throw of Dice Will Never Abolish Chance (1897) promoted the use of unique typography and a visual approach to writing, followed by poets and artists such as Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\nIn her essay \u201cThe Nexus between Typography and Poetics,\u201d Dr. Batsheva Goldman-Ida, a curator and scholar, says: \u201cA playful spirit is felt throughout Franco\u2019s project, in which the stringent rules provide a framework for artistic expression \u2026 [it] also enables the reader to view the typography as an artform in the sense of Gaston Bachelard, who speaks of the \u2018wholly unexpected nature of the new image\u2019 at the cusp of the moment, \u2018in a state of emergence, in which life becomes manifest through its vivacity.\u2019 Bachelard adds: \u2018The poetic image is an emergence from language, it is always a little above the language of signification.\u2019 In this respect, Franco\u2019s project is a work of poetry.\u201d\n\nThis is heady stuff. Tell me, what boundaries are you attempting to cross?\n\nI have been teaching graphic and typographic design for over two decades. Over the years, I have increasingly focused on typographic research, specifically developing courses that examine the boundaries of the discipline\u2014from its commercial and practical aspects to its experimental and research-oriented side. In my course Experimental Typography, I ask students to invent a method for various tests of the alphabet system. In subsequent stages, students are required to refine this method for different media and disciplines, essentially creating an imaginary world in which their system of rules has foundation and justification.\n\nI developed this same methodology in my laboratory. As mentioned, when I began working on the project, I started from very basic foundations. Each letter received a formula based on the atoms that constitute it. However, this principle can be creatively refined in countless directions. As I continued to invent tests, the molecular world grew. Very quickly, I realized that I was creating a world that is truly boundless. I didn\u2019t know that I would suddenly realize that if the atoms are based on a square grid, it would be possible to quantify and measure the number of squares in each letter. And if the grid is 3D, I could \u201cweigh\u201d each letter and essentially develop a system of molecular gematria, a traditional Jewish system of assigning numerical values to letters (numerology), where there is a \u201cweight\u201d for each letter, word or paragraph. I was then able to develop a gematria calculator capable of producing a list of synonyms with the same formula and weight. If I had not continued to let my imagination soar and realized that I could create anything I could think of, I would not have reached the understanding that, although atoms attract each other with electro-magnetic force, in the molecular world, I could cancel this force and create a situation in which, contrary to the laws of nature, minus could connect with minus and plus with plus. At this stage, I identified two Hebrew alphabet systems: binary and nonbinary, and essentially concluded that every word in the Hebrew language exists on a gender spectrum between binary and nonbinary.\n\nThe rhizomatic character of the study, which branched out as it expanded from one test to the next, enabled me to leap from one theme to another, employing a strategy that could continue operating as long as I was interested in pursuing it.\n\nCode plays a large role in your work. How so?\n\nCode and programming are indeed prominently reflected in the research. As noted, every letter in the Hebrew and Latin alphabets is composed of combinations of two to 11 atoms, which are arranged like a chemical formula. A digital catalyst developed in the laboratory creates different 3D variations for the formula pertaining to each letter of the alphabet. The result is a generative system of letters characterized by the identical features of a visual DNA. The catalyst also enables a perspectival, 3D view of each letter and of different combinations derived from the formula.\n\nThe 2D tests led to a system that independently rotates the atoms composing each letter. The rotations were examined according to three parameters: the angle of rotation, its centering, and the number of repetitions (the replications of the rotated atom). As a result, the visual form of each letter is deconstructed into fragments. The larger the angle of rotation, the more it impacts the letter\u2019s legibility and our ability to identify it. Additional tests isolated the atoms in the formula, enlarging each according to different proportions. Later, I examined the transformation of a given atom\u2019s size during use. With the typing of each character, certain atoms grew by 5%, a generative change that led to the chipping of the letter and impacted its legibility. The website I created for the project allows, unlike the book, the inclusion of videos and generative tests. In the future, I plan to add interactive interfaces to the website.\n\nIn his essay \u201cFrom Word to Code,\u201d Prof. Arch. Eran Neuman, dean of the Faculty of the Arts, Tel Aviv University, says: \u201c\u2026 the moment a letter is encoded, it can be given various visual expressions. In this sense, the letters are no different than animal species or humans, who share a similar genetic code despite their diverse appearances. The letters in Franco\u2019s typeface all share basic building blocks, yet each possesses a different form, and diverse visual expressions of the same letter are similarly based on the same code. \u2026 Franco\u2019s move from visual typefaces to code-based typefaces thus also reflects the current post-humanist age, in which the perception of ideas exceeds the limits of the gaze, of hearing or of touch, whose sensory input is required in making contact with the world. His typography, which goes beyond the design of typefaces, partakes of a digital universe in which texts are not written only by means of let\u00adters, and in which the meaning of different concepts is elucidated by deciphering a code.\u201d\n\nHow will the typefaces that have been designed under the umbrella of Molecular Typography be used in a pragmatic manner?\n\nThe project is indeed based on the design of an alphabetic system, initially in Hebrew and later in Latin. However, as noted, the design of the letters emerged from formal constraints. The typefaces were not designed as reading typefaces or even as display typefaces. While aesthetic decisions were, of course, made, they were confined to the use of the six \u201catoms\u201d alone, resulting in a highly raw and elemental letterform system. The Hebrew typeface, which was designed first, follows horizontal proportions. When I decided to create a Latin version, I was compelled to rotate the letterforms into a vertical orientation. As a result, the two languages are designed with distinct proportions and do not conform to the conventional definition of a bilingual typeface. Additionally, I have not yet attempted to design a lowercase version of the Latin alphabet. In the project, I use the typefaces in various ways, primarily leveraging the architectural potential of each letter to deconstruct and reconstruct them into an infinite number of appearances based on the same atomic formula. However, I do not foresee any pragmatic use for these typefaces beyond this project.",

            "content": "Why Alphabet (GOOGL) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 4.6% in the morning session as stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.\n\nNotably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model \"super impressive\" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,\" he added.\n\nNadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1.) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2.) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia\u2014whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.\n\nOverall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $191.80, down 4.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Alphabet? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 25 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 7% on the news that the company reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' revenue, operating income, and EPS expectations. The segments themselves were also all solid, with Search, YouTube, and Cloud all exceeding revenue estimates.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "With the market just hitting new all-time highs and the average market valuation at the upper end of the historical range, some may think there aren't any bargains left to buy.\n\nBut that's usually never true, as there are always bargains to be found in some corner of the market.\n\nAnd sometimes, a good deal comes even in the form of a household name staring you right in the face. Today, Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) looks like that very bargain.\n\n1. It's cheap\n\nDespite a nice rally last year, Alphabet remains the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet has a P/E ratio of 26.8, whereas no other Mag Seven stock has a valuation below 30. On a forward basis, Alphabet's forward P/E ratio is just 22.5.\n\nThat forward P/E ratio is even below that of the S&P 500 index, which stands at 24.3.\n\nThe low valuation comes in spite of several other elements that make Alphabet even cheaper than it looks. This includes the $93 billion in cash on Alphabet's balance sheet, good for about 4% of its market cap. And Alphabet continues to lose money on its experimental \"Other Bets\" segment. While suppressing today's profit, as we'll see, some of those projects are likely to have significant positive value.\n\n2. Alphabet's AI chops continue to be underrated\n\nPart of the reason Alphabet's valuation is so low is that investors are concerned that the bevy of artificial intelligence start-ups like OpenAI, Perplexity, and others will threaten the Google Search business.\n\nHowever, Google Search has enormous distribution, so much so that the name Google is synonymous with search. And Alphabet's AI subsidiaries DeepMind and Google Brain, brought together by Google in 2023, were the first to develop transformer technology, which is the breakthrough innovation that has enabled ChatGPT and other recent AI innovations.\n\nThe advent of ChatGPT initially caught Alphabet off guard, but Google's AI researchers seem to have gotten their act together over the past year. In December, Alphabet released Gemini 2.0, its in-house large language model, to rave reviews. And by putting AI-powered summaries at the top of appropriate searches, Google should be able to head off would-be competitors and keep customers in the Google ecosystem when searching for information.\n\nLast quarter, Google Search still managed to grow 12.2% despite its already massive size, showing no ill effects from the new AI competition. And since Alphabet produces its own in-house tensor processing units and has optimized its own AI infrastructure, Google's costs to produce AI are likely to be much lower than any startup, which probably has to run models on expensive Nvidia GPUs rented from the major clouds.\n\n3. Google Cloud is just getting started\n\nSpeaking of cloud, while Google Search and YouTube currently get most of the attention and drive most of Alphabet's profit, investors may not be giving Google Cloud the credit it deserves. Although third in the cloud infrastructure oligopoly, Google Cloud is more than holding its own. Last quarter, Google Cloud revenue accelerated 35%, the highest growth rate of any of the cloud IaaS providers, and operating profit surged 7.3 times over to $1.95 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud wasn't profitable as recently as two years ago, but the current $8 billion profit run-rate is beginning to contribute more meaningfully to overall profitability. Google Cloud contributed 7% to overall operating profit last quarter, and that figure is set to increase as enterprises increasingly migrate from on-premise to cloud-based IT services.\n\nCloud is set to be a second meaningful profit contributor, diversifying Alphabet away from its dependence purely on digital advertising dollars.\n\n4. Waymo is beginning to look like a real business\n\nFinally, Alphabet also has its often-ignored \"Other Bets\" segment, a loss-generating consortium of futuristic ventures that could take years or decades to pay off.\n\nWaymo began as an experimental self-driving program at Alphabet in 2009 within \"Other Bets,\" but 2024 proved to be a pivotal year for the technology. Having already started service in Phoenix in 2020, Waymo expanded its San Francisco service area and began full service to the public in Los Angeles last year. Amazingly, Waymo grew to the same market share as Lyft in San Francisco as of November, according to YipIt data.\n\nEven more cities could see autonomous disruption soon, as Waymo also announced an expansion to Austin and Atlanta in 2025, with a Miami expansion set for 2026. Waymo also announced it would begin its first international testing in Tokyo next year.\n\nWhile investors are ascribing hundreds of billions of dollars in value to Tesla's (TSLA -4.68%) robotaxi ambitions, they don't appear to be valuing Waymo as anything significant, given Alphabet's current value. But considering Waymo is the one with its own ride-hailing service already in operation in three major cities and taking market share from incumbents, Waymo seems like another hidden gem in Alphabet's technology portfolio.",

Photo: Reuters\n\nGovernments globally are drafting new regulations on issues that could be exacerbated by AI, such as copyright and privacy.\n\nThe EU AI Act, which seeks to assess risk and require disclosures from general-purpose AI systems, has received pushback from tech giants that could find themselves in the crosshairs of multibillion-dollar fines.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Department of Justice has also sought to curtail Google\u2019s advances in AI as a remedy in a federal case that found its search business to be an illegal monopoly.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai in September last year announced a US$120 million investment fund to build AI education programs. Deputies, including Walker, and Alphabet president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat are increasingly traveling globally to discuss policy recommendations with governments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of upside in terms of helping people who may be displaced by this. We do want to focus on that,\u201d Walker said.\n\nEfforts include expanding Grow with Google, an online and in-person program that provides training tools for businesses and teaches workers skills such as data analysis or information technology support that are meant to expand their career prospects in technical fields.\n\nGoogle last month said that 1 million people had obtained a certificate for the program.\n\nProgram head Lisa Gevelber said it is adding specialized courses related to AI, such as one geared toward teachers, program head.\n\nCourses alone are not enough to prepare workers, Walker said.\n\n\u201cWhat really matters is if you have some sort of objective that people are working towards, like a credential that people can use to apply for a job,\u201d he added.\n\nGoogle wants to increase experimentation on public-private partnerships, Walker said, citing the \u201cSkilled Trades and Readiness\u201d program as an example, in which the company has partnered with community colleges to train workers for potential jobs constructing data centers.\n\nGoogle is incorporating AI education into the program, he said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the federal government will look and see which proofs of concept are playing out \u2014 which of the green shoots are taking root,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIf we can help fertilize that effort, that\u2019s our role.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, Walker said he expects a small fraction of existing jobs to be entirely displaced by AI, citing several studies commissioned by Google, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and McKinsey & Co. Those studies suggest AI will be incorporated into most jobs in some capacity.\n\nAs part of Google's efforts to prepare for this shift, it hired economist David Autor as a visiting fellow to study the impacts of AI on the workforce. Autor said in an interview that AI could be used to create more immersive training programs, akin to flight simulators.\n\n\u201cThe history of adult retraining is not particularly glorious,\u201d he said. \u201cAdults don\u2019t want to go back to class. Classroom training is not going to be the solution to a lot of retraining.\u201d",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 160\n\nJoe Tigay from Equity Armor Investments said in a latest program on Schwab Network that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best AI stocks because of the data the company has.\n\n\u201cThey have the most data, in my opinion. They have the best stores of data, and they are going to be putting it to good use. That is the name of the game for AI. They will be profiting off of this data because they have the search component, which is their core business. So, for me, I think they are best positioned to utilize this new revolution. And I think it\u2019s attractively priced here to do so.\u201d\n\nThe market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google\u2019s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader.\n\nWhat are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August.\n\nThis growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day\u2014substantially higher than Uber\u2019s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber\u2019s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo\u2019s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing.\n\nGoogle Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit\u2014a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment\u2019s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): Google was our top detractor in the third quarter despite reporting second quarter results that were generally in line with expectations. The company reported slightly better revenue growth in Search, which grew 14% and continues to be resilient in the face of AI challengers, and Google Cloud, which grew 29% in the quarter. Service operating income margins of 40% and Cloud operating income margins of 11% were also both ahead of investors\u2019 expectations as management\u2019s cost-efficiency efforts drove operating leverage. YouTube revenue growth was slightly below expectations (+13% v. +16%) driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons and some general weakness in the Brand Advertising vertical. Finally, Cap Ex in the quarter of $13.2 billion was more than expected and likely the driver of the weakness in the stock as investors grapple with how much infrastructure investment will be required to achieve Google\u2019s AI goals. With its high margin business model (44% EBITDA margins last quarter), continued strength across its core Search and YouTube franchises, and continued growth and expanding profitability in its still relatively small Cloud business, we continue to view Alphabet as among the best-positioned secular growth franchises in the market. Additionally, GOOG shares trade at a compelling 19.5x the Street\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate, a discount to the Russell 1000 Growth Index.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 1st on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite what appears to be strong performance since the third-quarter results, analyst Brent Thill stated the Google parent is fairly valued, according to a report published Monday.\n\nThe study indicates expectations for the fourth quarter are solid, particularly against conservative market forecasts. Thill noted, \"The fourth quarter is expected to perform well due to consistent advertising spending and progress made within Google's cloud services.\" This reflects the belief among analysts at Jefferies about the sustaining growth potential of the technology giant amid market fluctuations.\n\nAccording to the report dated January 24, 2025, Alphabet\u2019s stock has shown significant resilience, even as it traded down 3.86% at \u20ac183.4 on Tradegate around January 27, 2025. Thill remains confident, citing strong underlying factors driving the business. \"Google is expected to benefit from continued solid advertising expenditures and advancements within their cloud services,\" added Thill.\n\nThe overall outlook provided by Jefferies sees Alphabet not just holding its ground but also leveraging improvements and operations across divisions to achieve growth. This sentiment is particularly relevant as investors are gearing up for what is expected to be another interesting quarter for the tech sector following several economic challenges over the past year.\n\nThis positive stance and stock evaluation takes place within the broader market framework where tech stocks have faced volatility, yet Google\u2019s underlying business performance continues to impress analysts.\n\nThe previous rating remaining intact at 'Buy' with the projected price remaining at $235 suggests Jefferies perceives the stock still holds optimal potential for growth and return on investment.\n\nBrent Thill's perspectives sketch out the optimism shared within investment circles about Alphabet's prospects, particularly as new business initiatives continue to be rolled out. The anticipation around Alphabet's looming earnings report is expected to also build investor interest, with market watchers noting the need to see if the company delivers on the anticipated performance outlined.\n\nThe original study was published on January 24, 2025, at 6:11 PM ET, with its first dissemination occurring on January 26 at 5:00 PM ET. For readers interested, additional information related to disclosure obligations for conflicts of interest involving research houses can be found on Jefferies' official website.\n\nThe market's eye is now focused on how Alphabet will position itself following its earnings announcement, as expert analyses and reports keep building the narrative for what\u2019s next for the tech behemoth.\n\nAlphabet A shares have been regarded positively within investment channels, gaining 653% since initial recommendations presented by various analysts. Overall, the guidance from Jefferies points not just to cautious optimism but asserts the company's role as pivotal within the tech ecosystem.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of The DeepSeek AI Effect: 10 Stocks Feeling the Heat. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect.\n\nMarkets were in turmoil after Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced a low-cost AI model over the weekend. DeepSeek is set to disrupt the AI industry, having developed the technology using a fraction of the resources used by competitors in the US. It is a direct challenge to rivals like OpenAI, Google and Meta, whose valuations now come under scrutiny. DeepSeek also reduces the usage of chips and energy. Investors are now keen on understanding what a justified valuation of chip manufacturers would be after accounting for a more efficient technology that is expected to curb demand for huge data centers that run on extremely expensive chips. DeepSeek has already gained popularity since its launch, occupying a top position in the Apple Store.\n\nThe NASDAQ is down almost 3%, with cumulative losses for the top 10 losers reaching $965 billion. Chipmakers lost the most value followed by big tech companies. Even firms supplying electricity have been reeling after this announcement. Big players like Meta and Microsoft are monitoring the development closely and are expected to bring changes to their software after DeepSeek\u2019s foray into AI.\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article we have picked a list of 10 stocks that have witnessed the highest erosion in value due to the DeepSeek effect. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Feeling the Heat from The DeepSeek AI Effect?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 202\n\nEven as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) remained resilient, the share price was down more than 4%, leading to a loss in value of around $90 billion. DeepSeek will definitely compete directly with Gemini, GOOG\u2019s generative AI chatbot.\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 5th on our list of stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "Analysts at Jefferies recently ranked the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.\n\nIts top picks among the group were Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) and Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies' rankings, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft.\n\nThe firm's rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versus capex (capital expenditures) spending.\n\nNvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.\n\nLet's look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.\n\nNvidia's growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.\n\nAs large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia's CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI's data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting of Oracle, SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.\n\nA lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nWhile no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia's recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.\n\nLast quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.\n\nCloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.\n\nWith organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.\n\nAs it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud's margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet owns the world's dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.\n\nThe company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.\n\nManagement also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.\n\nOverall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.",

            "content": "Alphabet\u2019s Google, facing an unprecedented regulatory onslaught, even a possible breakup, is now turning to shape public perception and policies on artificial intelligence ahead of a global wave of AI regulation.\n\nA key priority, one executive told Reuters, comes in building out educational programs to train the workforce on AI.\n\n\"Getting more people and organizations, including governments, familiar with AI and using AI tools, makes for better AI policy and opens up new opportunities \u2013 it's a virtuous cycle,\" said Kent Walker, Alphabet's president of global affairs.\n\nAs Google races to best Big Tech rivals including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Meta in the AI arena, it is mindful of the heavy regulatory scrutiny it faces in its existing businesses in advertising and search.\n\nIn the European Union, Google has offered to sell a part of its ad tech business to appease regulators, Reuters reported.\n\nIn the U.S., the Justice Department (DOJ) is attempting to force a breakup of its Chrome web browser \u2013 though it may shift course under the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, governments globally are drafting new regulations on issues that could be exacerbated by AI, such as copyright and privacy. The EU AI Act, which seeks to assess risk and require disclosures from general-purpose AI systems, has received pushback from tech giants that could find themselves in the crosshairs of multibillion-dollar fines. The DOJ has also sought to curtail Google\u2019s advances in AI as a remedy in a federal case that found its search business to be an illegal monopoly.\n\nGoogle executives see an opportunity to shape the narrative around a technology that has stoked emerging fears of mass job loss.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai announced in September a $120 million investment fund to build AI education programs. Deputies including Walker and Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer, are increasingly traveling globally to discuss policy recommendations with governments.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of upside in terms of helping people who may be displaced by this. We do want to focus on that,\u201d Walker said. Efforts include expanding Grow with Google, a combination online and in-person program that provides training tools for businesses and teaches workers skills like data analysis or IT support that are meant to expand their career prospects in technical fields.\n\nIn December, the company said 1 million people had obtained a certificate for the program. It is adding specialized courses related to AI, such as one geared toward teachers, said program head Lisa Gevelber.\n\nCourses alone are not enough to prepare workers, Walker said. \"What really matters is if you have some sort of objective that people are working towards, like a credential that people can use to apply for a job.\u201d\n\nGoogle wants to increase experimentation on public-private partnerships, he said. The leading example so far, he said, is the \"Skilled Trades and Readiness\u201d program, in which the company has partnered with community colleges to train workers for potential jobs constructing data centers. Google is incorporating AI education into the program, he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, the federal government will look and see which proofs of concept are playing out - which of the green shoots are taking root,\u201d Walker said. \"If we can help fertilize that effort, that\u2019s our role.\u201d\n\nIn the long-term, Walker said he expects a small fraction of existing jobs to be entirely displaced by AI, citing several studies commissioned by Google, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. Those studies suggest AI will be incorporated into most jobs in some capacity.\n\nAs part of Google's efforts to prepare for this shift, it hired economist David Autor as a visiting fellow to study the impacts of AI on the workforce. Autor said in an interview that AI could be used to create more immersive training programs, akin to flight simulators.\n\n\"The history of adult retraining is not particularly glorious,\" he said. \"Adults don\u2019t want to go back to class. Classroom training is not going to be the solution to a lot of retraining.\"",

The impressive growth in the company\u2019s revenue and earnings in recent quarters reflects the solid momentum that NVDA\u2019s GPUs are witnessing due to the ongoing generative AI boom. Given these AI tailwinds, Nvidia has surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company with a market cap of $3.61 trillion.\n\nLooking ahead, there are high expectations from the company\u2019s Blackwell platform. Moreover, the company is expected to benefit from the recently announced U.S. AI infrastructure project called Stargate.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nRecently, Barclays analyst Thomas O\u2019Malley highlighted the semiconductor stocks that he likes for 2025, including Nvidia. The analyst stated that Nvidia remains the dominant player in AI compute. He expects the company\u2019s data center compute business to grow by nearly 60% year-over-year in 2025, driven by next-generation GPUs and advancements in networking architecture.\n\nO\u2019Malley expects the company\u2019s Blackwell offering to generate around $15 billion in revenue in the first quarter, with the potential to more than double the number quarter-over-quarter. Additionally, the analyst sees significant upside in the second half of 2025, supported by the robust momentum in the B200 cycle and the growth in the B300/Ultra offerings.\n\nWith 36 Buys and three Holds, Nvidia stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target of $176.86 implies 24% upside potential.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet shares have risen about 35% over the past year. The company reported market-beating third-quarter results, with 35% year-over-year growth in its Cloud unit and continued strength in the Search and YouTube businesses.\n\nDespite investors\u2019 concerns about the impact of growing competition in Search and regulatory pressures, Alphabet is optimistic about maintaining its dominance through its AI offerings.\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to announce its Q4 2024 results on February 4. Analysts expect the company\u2019s EPS (earnings per share) to rise more than 29% year-over-year to $2.12. They forecast a 12% growth in Q4 revenue to $96.62 billion.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for GOOGL Stock?\n\nHeading into Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 results, Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $225. The analyst expects Q4 results to reflect persistent momentum in Search, YouTube, and Cloud, with AI continuing to be in focus.\n\nNotably, Squali expects GOOGL\u2019s Q4 2024 results to be almost in line with the Street\u2019s estimates, with revenue up by low double-digits. Moreover, the analyst expects an operating margin of more than 30%, as efforts to control operating expenses are expected to have more than offset higher capital expenditure.\n\nOverall, Alphabet stock scores Wall Street\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys and eight Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $217.93 indicates about 9% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms stock has rallied 66% over the past year, thanks to the company\u2019s streamlining efforts and rebound in ad spending. However, regulatory pressures, significant losses in the Reality Labs unit (operating loss of over $58 billion since 2020), and massive investments in AI could limit the upside in the stock this year.\n\nOn Friday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year in capex to build AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg views 2025 as \u201ca defining year for AI.\u201d The company expects its massive AI investments to drive innovation and future growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is scheduled to announce its Q4 2024 on January 29. Analysts expect the social media giant to report about a 27% year-over-year jump in Q4 EPS to $6.75. Revenue is expected to rise 17% to $46.97 billion.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nIn reaction to Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement of the $60 billion to $65 billion in capex to support the company\u2019s product roadmap, Citi analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating on META stock with a price target of $75 and called it his Top Pick. Josey added that while Meta\u2019s 2025 capex range is modestly ahead of his $58.5 billion estimate, he expects these investments to drive continued engagement growth and monetization benefits as \u201cnewer product vectors emerge, like Search (with Meta AI), Agents (with AI Studio), and Enterprise (with Llama 4), among others.\u201d\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating. The average META stock price target of $692.23 implies about 7% upside potential.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile analysts are highly bullish on the three Magnificent 7 stocks discussed here, they see higher upside potential in NVDA stock even after a stellar rally over the past year. Nvidia continues to capture the solid demand for its advanced GPUs in the AI space and is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the semiconductor market through continued innovation and strong execution.\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "Quantum computing stocks have seen quite a run-up in recent months, but determining which companies are leading the charge can be tough to navigate.\n\nFor the past few months, quantum computing stocks such as IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum have garnered a lot of attention and witnessed pronounced run-ups in their share prices. The momentum each of these stocks is experiencing certainly makes the idea of quantum computing a tempting investment opportunity.\n\nBut as I've expressed previously, I'd caution from following the crowd when it comes to mainstream quantum computing stocks. Instead, I'd suggest turning to big tech -- and in particular, Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) and Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%).\n\nIsn't Nvidia just a chip company? And isn't Alphabet just an advertising behemoth? Believe it or not, both of these \"Magnificent Seven\" members are leading the charge in the quantum computing movement behind the scenes.\n\nLet's explore how Nvidia and Alphabet are playing a role in quantum computing and assess if either of these stocks are good buying opportunities right now.\n\n1. How is Nvidia involved in quantum computing?\n\nNvidia specializes in designing chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are the hardware that process algorithms and sophisticated computations that help train generative AI applications, such as large language models and machine learning protocols.\n\nHowever, one aspect of Nvidia's business that is unique is its tight integration between hardware and software. The company also offers a software suite called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which layers on top of Nvidia's hardware stack.\n\nWithin the CUDA ecosystem, Nvidia offers a tangential platform known as CUDA-Q that focuses specifically on quantum computing development. CUDA-Q is marketed as a \"unified programming model.\" In simple terms, the CUDA-Q architecture allows for seamless integration between GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), and quantum processing units (QPUs), all in a singular platform.\n\nRecently, the company announced that Google is leveraging CUDA-Q and H100 GPUs to power simulations that will help in designing the search giant's quantum computer. To me, the subtle idea here is that Nvidia continues to unlock opportunities for becoming both the primary hardware and software provider for major corporations, and their various explorations of AI products and services.\n\n2. How is Alphabet involved in quantum computing?\n\nAlthough Nvidia remains the dominant force in semiconductors, it's important to note that many hyperscalers including Alphabet have been exploring developing their own chipware.\n\nBack in December, Alphabet made a major announcement as it relates to its quantum computing ambitions. Specifically, Google Quantum revealed that its new quantum chip, dubbed Willow, was able to perform a computation in less than five minutes that would otherwise take today's most capable supercomputer 10 septillion years to figure out.\n\nAre Nvidia and Alphabet stock good buys right now?\n\nWhile Nvidia and Alphabet have made notable progress in the field of quantum computing, it's important to take a step back and consider some important details.\n\nFor example, even though Alphabet's Willow chip possesses immense processing power, does figuring out a problem that would take 10 septillion years really matter right now? Personally, I think the answer is \"no.\"\n\nAnd while CUDA-Q appears to already have gained some impressive traction, I'd caution investors from buying into the idea that this specific part of Nvidia's business will make a meaningful financial impact anytime soon.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 46.6. Notably, this is much lower than the company's forward P/E from even just a few years ago. Considering Nvidia is a much different business today and consistently generates record growth across sales and profits, the current contraction in valuation multiples suggests Nvidia is not only reasonably priced, but it could be seen as cheap right now.\n\nIn a similar fashion, Alphabet's forward P/E of 22 is identical to its three- and five-year averages. I think investors may be discounting Alphabet's potential given the fierce competition the company faces in advertising from Meta Platforms and TikTok, and the challenging market dynamics in cloud computing, which is currently dominated by Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nI think concerns surrounding Alphabet are misaligned. Despite various competitive landscapes, the company remains a dominant force online thanks to Google Search and YouTube, and its cloud computing platform is swiftly becoming Alphabet's next big generator of accelerating cash flow.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think both Nvidia and Alphabet are stocks to buy hand over fist -- but not necessarily because of quantum computing. While I think quantum computing could become a major contributor for both businesses at some point, I think there are more clear near-term catalysts underscored by other pockets of the AI realm that will influence their respective growth.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "If there's an AI bubble, it's nowhere in sight.\n\nHeading into 2025, the biggest question for Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) is whether the artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar can continue to grow at a breakneck pace.\n\nSome investors have argued that an AI bubble is forming, and there is evidence that the new technology is following in the footsteps of earlier bubbles due in part to the dramatic growth in some AI stocks. Nvidia has been the flag bearer for the AI boom thus far after posting several quarters of triple-digit revenue growth, and there were news reports earlier this month that should reassure investors that the company and the broader AI sector still have a long runway of growth in front of them.\n\nAI start-ups are on fire\n\nChatGPT creator OpenAI might be a household name by now, but there's a lesser-known AI start-up that is starting to make waves.\n\nThat's Anthropic, the creator of the Claude AI chatbot, which counts Amazon and Alphabet among its backers, having raised billions of dollars from the tech giants. Anthropic is now in talks for a massive new funding round, and it's a bullish signal for Nvidia and the broader sector as well.\n\nAccording to multiple media outlets, Anthropic was in advanced talks earlier in January to raise $2 billion at a price that values the company at $60 billion, up from a valuation of $16 billion less than a year ago.\n\nThe news is the latest sign of skyrocketing valuations for privately held AI start-ups, which show growing investor enthusiasm for AI and confidence that companies like Anthropic will justify that valuation over the long term, eventually generating billions in profits.\n\nUltimately, the frenzy over AI start-ups will benefit Nvidia as a significant chunk of that $2 billion is likely to be spent on Nvidia chips to power Anthropic's AI models.\n\nAnthropic has a history of working with Nvidia and buying its chips, though the company said it would use Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips to train future foundation models when it took $4 billion from Amazon last November.\n\nThe details of the current funding round aren't clear as it hasn't closed, but the deal is likely to yield a windfall for Nvidia in some capacity as it is widely recognized as the leader in AI chip technology, and fully tying itself to Amazon could make Anthropic less competitive. Even Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has said that the company views its AI processors as a \"supplement\" to Nvidia's GPUs rather than a replacement.\n\nThe funding round also adds fuel to the AI arms race among start-ups and should encourage investors in rival companies to shell out billions more. OpenAI, for example, completed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing the company at $157 billion in October.\n\nOpenAI has been a major customer of Nvidia, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first H200 AI supercomputer to OpenAI. The Sam Altman-led start-up has visions of developing its own AI chips, but that's likely years away. For the foreseeable future, it will be reliant on Nvidia's chips, and its recent funding round could mean billions more flowing into Nvidia's coffers. Nvidia was also an investor in the round, which could strengthen its relationship with the AI start-up.\n\nWhat it means for Nvidia\n\nWhile big tech companies like Amazon and others are working on their own AI chips, it's going to be difficult to dethrone Nvidia, whose market share in data center GPUs is estimated to be around 95%. Nvidia continues to rapidly innovate, preparing its Rubin platform as a more advanced version of the recently released Blackwell.\n\nNvidia also benefits from a flat management structure that makes decision-making faster and easier and avoids the kind of siloing that has plagued competitors like Intel. Finally, it has an advantage over potential rivals like Amazon as it's a dedicated pure-play semiconductor company, while businesses like Amazon have other priorities.\n\nNvidia's AI foundation arguably began in 2006 when it launched its CUDA parallel computing model that now contains hundreds of software libraries and AI models, showing it has a significant technological advantage. CEO Jensen Huang has long been regarded as a visionary in AI as well.\n\nOverall, what's good for AI is good for Nvidia, and the billions flowing into start-ups at soaring valuations show the AI boom and Nvidia's AI-driven growth still have a long way to run. Expect Nvidia to deliver another strong year for investors in 2025.",

The potential for these computers to dramatically change everything from weather prediction to cybersecurity encryption is high, though likely years away.\n\nInvestors looking to buy into a company that will likely play a huge part in quantum computing's future need to look no further than Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%). Here are two reasons why it might be the best quantum computing stock to buy right now.\n\n1. Alphabet is making significant advancements\n\nAlphabet made waves recently when the company announced its new quantum computing processor, called Willow. In a blog, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven said Willow achieved two major achievements:\n\nError reduction\n\nQuantum computing bits, or qubits, can be in states of zero and one simultaneously, while a traditional computer bit can only be one or the other. This can allow for faster problem-solving, but can also increase errors.\n\nBut with Google's Willow chip, the company was able to lower the number of errors. By scaling up the number of qubits, Alphabet was able to \"reduce errors exponentially\" that have plagued the field for nearly 30 years, the company said.\n\nBenchmark processing achievement\n\nNeven said Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, which is notable because it would take today's fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years, \"a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe,\" to do the same.\n\nQuantum computing could vastly improve the ability to break encryption, develop far more efficient electric vehicle batteries, and create more advanced artificial intelligence (AI), among other things. Research from BCG estimates the quantum computing market will reach $850 billion by 2040. With Alphabet's Willow processor, the company is at the cutting edge of quantum computing, and its lead could be hard to overcome.\n\n2. Alphabet has the money and patience to play the long game\n\nAlphabet said the impressive results from its Willow chip were the culmination of work that began more than 10 years ago. This long-term mindset and a large cash pile should give the company an advantage over competitors.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Alphabet had nearly $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $17.6 billion in free cash flow.\n\nWith its strong financial foundation, the company is under far less pressure to see immediate results from its quantum computing investments than its competitors. Some pure-play quantum computing competitors may have shorter timelines for breakthroughs or need to find commercial uses much faster; Alphabet can instead play the long game.\n\nAnd it will be a long game.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said recently that practical uses for quantum computing could be two decades away. Alphabet itself says it will be many years before there's a commercial use for Willow.\n\nHowever, with Alphabet's cash and willingness to develop cutting-edge technology over time, owning shares of the company looks like a smart idea. Quantum computing could take a similar path as AI, with companies investing lots of money and time before it finally reaches a tipping point for practical use.\n\nIt might be wise to invest in quantum computing now. With Alphabet's stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 22, investors can buy this quantum computing leader while it's relatively inexpensive.",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against Prem Watsa's other long-term stock picks.\n\nPrem Watsa is a Canadian billionaire, entrepreneur, and investor often referred to as the Canadian Warren Buffett for his value-based investment approach and long-term focus. As the founder, chairman, and CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, Watsa has built a reputation for transforming his company into one of the leading insurance and investment firms in the world. His ability to identify undervalued opportunities and navigate financial crises has cemented his place as one of the most respected figures in global finance. Watsa was born in India in 1950 to a middle-class family. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, one of India\u2019s premier institutions. In 1972, Watsa immigrated to Canada to pursue an MBA at the University of Western Ontario\u2019s Richard Ivey School of Business.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAfter completing his MBA, Watsa began his career in the insurance industry, where he gained valuable experience that would later shape his business philosophy and success. In 1985, Watsa acquired control of Markel Financial, a struggling Canadian insurance company. He renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings, short for Fair and Friendly Acquisitions, and set out to implement his vision of combining insurance underwriting with value-oriented investing. Fairfax operates as a holding company, similar to Berkshire Hathaway, with investments spanning insurance, reinsurance, and other businesses. Under Watsa's leadership, Fairfax has grown exponentially.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Fairfax manages over $1 billion in 13F securities. The company has delivered a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15% in book value per share since its founding. Prem Watsa is a staunch proponent of value investing, inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His strategy involves identifying undervalued assets, particularly during times of market distress, and holding them for the long term. Watsa has been a strong advocate of investing in India, acquiring stakes in companies like Thomas Cook India and launching the Fairfax India fund to capitalize on the country\u2019s growth. Watsa famously anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, using derivatives to protect Fairfax\u2019s portfolio and earning over $2 billion in profits during the crash.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Dan Loeb is swapping out one of the cheapest industry-leading AI stocks for another with well-defined competitive advantages and a nosebleed valuation.\n\nYear two of Wall Street's bull market rally didn't disappoint investors. When the curtain closed on 2024, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite respectively ended the year higher by 13%, 23%, and 29%.\n\nThese gains were powered by a confluence of factors, including excitement for stock splits, improved corporate earnings, and even Donald Trump's November victory. Trump's first term in the White House saw the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite climb by 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nBut among these catalysts, none have been more front-and-center than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Incorporating AI into software and systems is a $15.7 trillion addressable market by 2030, based on the forecast of PwC in Sizing the Prize.\n\nThis otherworldly potential for AI isn't lost on Wall Street's top money managers. A number of billionaire investors have been placing their bets on the AI revolution, including Dan Loeb, the founder of investment hedge fund Third Point.\n\nBased on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows investors to track the trading activity of Wall Street's top asset managers, Loeb closed out the September quarter with $7.43 billion in assets under management spread across 42 stocks. What's most notable about Third Point's third-quarter 13F is what trades were made in the AI arena.\n\nLoeb sold all of his fund's shares in what's arguably one of the cheapest AI leaders in favor one of Wall Street's priciest AI stocks.\n\nDan Loeb's Third Point dumps its entire stake in Alphabet\n\nAlthough Loeb and his team tend to be fairly active -- the average holding time for Third Point's more than three dozen holdings is only 17 months -- perhaps the most surprising of all moves in the September-ended quarter was exiting the fund's entire stake in Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%), which totaled 1.98 million shares on June 30.\n\nProfit-taking is the most-logical of all reasons that potentially explains why Loeb rang the register. He initially oversaw the purchase of Alphabet shares during the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet spent much of its time vacillating between $90 and $100 per share in early 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet stock hovered between $150 and $170 per share during the third quarter of 2024. That's a compelling gain in less than two years.\n\nLoeb and his team may have also been concerned about history running its course when it comes to next-big-thing innovations. Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, every game-changing technology and innovation has endured an early stage bubble-bursting event. This is a function of investors consistently overestimating the early innings utility of a new technology/innovation. With most businesses lacking a game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investment, the probability of an AI bubble brewing appears to be growing.\n\nHowever, Loeb's exit from Alphabet is also a head-scratcher in other respects.\n\nFor instance, Alphabet's advertising segments are still firing on all cylinders. Google is the world's leading internet search engine and has maintained an 89% to 93% share of global internet search looking back over the last decade, according to data from GlobalStats. Businesses wanting to target users are going to pay a premium to get their message(s) on Alphabet's platforms -- which also includes streaming platform YouTube (the No. 2 social site by monthly active users).\n\nThere's also no evidence of a slowdown in Alphabet's higher-margin cloud infrastructure services platform Google Cloud. This segment became recurringly profitable in 2023 and hasn't looked back, with Google Cloud pacing more than $45 billion in annual run-rate revenue. Incorporating generative AI solutions into Google Cloud is expected to accelerate this segment's long-term growth prospects.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is that Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.8 is 6% below its trailing-five-year average forward P/E, and it's valued at a 10% discount to its average cash flow multiple over the last five years.\n\nSuffice it to say, Loeb may regret ringing the register on Alphabet.\n\nDan Loeb is piling into one of Wall Street's priciest AI stocks\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Loeb and his team of advisors at Third Point added to four existing holdings and purchased nine new stocks during the September-ended quarter. None of these purchases stands out more than the 400,000 shares bought of electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA -4.68%).\n\nArtificial intelligence is at the heart of what Tesla does. The company's EVs are empowered by full self-driving (FSD) software and AI algorithms that uses cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to navigate public roadways, pedestrians, and other obstacles. AI solutions are also used to maximize EV battery performance and optimize energy storage.\n\nLoeb's fascination with Tesla may have to do with the long-term growth potential of EVs and the company's first-mover advantages. It's North America's leading EV producer -- 1.77 million EVs produced worldwide in 2024 -- and one of the only pure-play EV companies to generate a recurring profit.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla has been diversifying its operations into energy solutions and infrastructure (including EV charging stations). Energy generation and storage revenue surged by 52% during the September-ended quarter from the prior-year period. Providing battery and storage solutions in a basic necessity sector may help Tesla better navigate the cyclical downturns that occur from time to time in the auto industry.\n\nBut it can be argued that this purchase is just as head-scratching as selling shares of Alphabet. For instance, Tesla's operating margin has notably shrunk due to more than a half-dozen sweeping price cuts for its fleet of EVs. CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that demand drives the company's pricing policy. A steady stream of price cuts, coupled with higher global EV inventory, is an unwelcome combination for the company's margins.\n\nAnother plain-as-day issue is that more than half of Tesla's pre-tax income originates from unsustainable sources, which includes interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. A high-growth company valued at a nosebleed premium should be generating its profits from its products and not from unsustainable sources.\n\nThere's also a lengthy history of unmet promises with Tesla. While Musk has overseen the rollout of new EVs as the company's chief, he's also failed to bring robotaxis to public roads, as previously promised, and hasn't advanced Tesla's FSD past Level 2 autonomy. If these unmet promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, much of the company's market cap would, arguably, disappear.\n\nPaying 131 times forward-year earnings for a company with margins and earnings per share that have weakened in recent years is questionable, at best.",

The company is the G in the FAANG stock acronym and a blue-chip operator of Internet infrastructure. The company was founded on September 4 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while the two were Ph.D. students at Stanford.\n\nThe original product was a tool for searching the rapidly growing Internet that revolutionized the budding Search Engine industry. Since its founding, Google has become the world\u2019s premier and leading search engine commanding an estimated 86% of the search market in 2021. The company abruptly changed its name and operating structure in 2015 making it a parent company with Google a subsidiary. This provided some protection against anti-trust lawsuits, improved accounting, and allowed the company to expand into areas outside of search.\n\nAlphabet provides various products and platforms globally, where it is permitted, and operates in three broad segments. The three operating segments are Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The company is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and is located within a sprawling complex of modernized and new buildings called the Googleplex. The Googleplex is prominently located within the San Francisco Bay Area and is the company\u2019s largest complex. Employees working in the Googleplex are afforded free transportation on the company\u2019s shuttle bus system as well as other ground-breaking perks.\n\nThe Google Services segment is the core of the business. Google Services is built around the Google Search Engine and offers products and services to both businesses and consumers. Among the many revenue streams are search-related ad sales, Android operating system for mobile devices, Chrome web browser, assorted hardware, Gmail email accounts, Google Drive cloud-based office suite, Google Maps mapping, geolocation, and GPS tools as well as Google Photos, Google Play, and YouTube which it leverages in a variety of ways. Other revenue streams include apps and in-app sales via the Google Play store, the sale of Fitbit devices, and Google Nest smart-home products.\n\nThe Google Cloud segment is the less visible of the two major operating segments but is no less important to the infrastructure of the Internet or the company\u2019s bottom line. The Google Cloud segment offers cloud-based infrastructure, operating platforms, and other services for business as well as a suite of cloud-based products of its own. The Google Workspace includes project management and collaboration tools such as Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet. Google cloud services account for roughly 9% of the global cloud market share making it the 3rd largest operator.\n\nThe Other Bets segment is Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm and it invests in technologies of all kinds and at all stages of development. Some of the projects under the Other Bets umbrella include Waymo and Verily. Waymo was formerly known as Google\u2019s self-driving car project and is focused on self-driving vehicles and related technologies. Verily is focused on the healthcare sector and aims to help detect, prevent, and manage diseases.",

It also includes the transfer of VIVE (HTC\u2019s virtual reality platform) engineers to Google and grants Google non-exclusive IP (intellectual property) rights.

The platform integrates the Gemini assistant, and various Google apps like Maps, Chrome, and YouTube, and supports multiple virtual screens. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u2018Project Moohan\u2019 headset will be the first product under Android XR, expected to launch later this year. These headsets will directly compete with Meta\u2019s (META) Orion smart glasses and Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro headset.\n\nGoogle said this deal will speed up Android XR development for headsets and glasses, boosting its position in the VR race with Apple and Meta.\n\nAre Google Shares a Good Buy?\n\nOn Wall Street, analysts remain highly optimistic about GOOG stock.

            "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 9%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Alphabet was expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, but it reported $2.12 per share instead, representing a surprise of 15.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.85 per share, while it actually produced $1.89 per share, a surprise of 2.16%.\n\nFor Alphabet, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 4, 2025.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

Despite this minor reduction, expectations for the rest of the year remain positive.\n\nUpcoming earnings, scheduled for February 4th have a consensus EPS expectation of $2.12, against revenue of $96.61 billion.\n\nIn the broader context, Alphabet's full-year earnings for 2025 are projected to reach $10.14 per share, as per Roth Capital's estimations. The quarterly breakdown for this year suggests earnings figures of $2.42 for Q2, $2.53 for Q3, and $2.88 for Q4.\n\nElsewhere, Cantor Fitzgerald also released their earnings per share (EPS) predictions for the fiscal year 2025. They have estimated the EPS for Alphabet at $9.05, maintaining a neutral rating and setting a price target of $210 on the stock.\n\nThe consensus estimate for Alphabet's current full-year earnings stands at $8.03 per share, indicating anticipation of growth in the coming years from both Cantor Fitzgerald, and Roth.\n\nAlphabet's recent quarterly performance presented a notable beat against analyst expectations, reporting an EPS of $2.12, which exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.29. Additionally, the company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $88.27 billion, surpassing the forecasted $86.39 billion.\n\nAlphabet continues to operate through segments like Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, offering a wide array of services and products, including advertisements, Android, Chrome, and YouTube. The diversification of its offerings underscores the firm's strategy to sustain growth across multiple sectors.\n\nWhile Roth Capital's slight downgrade for Q1 2025 reflects a touch of caution, Alphabet's overall financial outlook for the year remains robust with significant anticipated earnings growth.

The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat Is Alphabet Worth?\n\nAccording to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 25.72x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers\u2019 ratio of 25.72x, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you\u2019d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe Alphabet should be trading in this range, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, it seems like Alphabet\u2019s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it\u2019s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Alphabet generate?\n\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 22nd 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 43%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at GOOGL? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?\n\nStory Continues",

Their Oakland-based program uses hip hop to teach elementary school children the ABCs of social justice.\n\n\"At first, we were rapping about vegetables, colors, nutrition and things. After we started talking with these kids, we realized here's more things to be talking about,\" Shepherd explained.\n\n\"We were having these conversations with preschoolers: 'Why are these people calling this bad word? Why are people telling me what my identity is instead of listening to me when I tell them I have multiple cultures in my identity?'\" McGaw added.\n\nMcGaw and Shepherd guided students to unleash their creative voice as they began to write songs about bullying, racism, and exclusion.\n\n\"It's almost like, big empathy work, to create songs that frame a world of belonging,\" said McGaw.\n\nAlphabet Rockers leads dozens of workshops a year at Bay Area schools and community groups. The program is fiscally sponsored by the nonprofit Sozo Impact.\n\nWorkshops can cost $3,000 to $5,000, but the fees are often offset by donations and fundraising. Students feel empowered as they craft songs and poems and then perform them at concerts.\n\n10-year-old Onyx Austin took part in the Alphabet Rockers' six-month afterschool program Movement in Action at the Destiny Arts Center.\n\n\"We are the movement in action. We got the love,\" Austin sang as he performed one of the songs written with the program.\n\nHe said Shepherd and McGaw are like family, and he takes to heart the lessons they sing about.\n\n\"Even though people are bullies, they have a tiny bit of good in them,\" Austin said.\n\nFellow participant Matthew Bransford is proud of how he's grown as a songwriter and performer.\n\n\"I have the courage to perform something big that I've made in front of my whole school,\" he smiled.\n\nAnd McGaw, Shepherd and three of their young stars rocked the music world when they won a Grammy Award in 2023 for best children's music album.\n\nBut the pair says the best is still to come.\n\n\"Music changes our culture, where every song we write is something that helps people through the day, that gives them tools to strategize and that brings us together,\" McGaw explained.\n\nNext, the program plans to focus on climate justice as part of a world tour.\n\n\"Alphabet Rockers is very community. we're gonna expand our community to the globe,\" chuckled Shepherd.\n\nSo for empowering Alphabet Rockers to create music for social change, this week's CBS News Bay Area Icon Award goes to Tommy Soulati Shepherd and Kaitlin McGaw. You can nominate a community hero for an Icon Award here.",

Celebrating the intersection of art and typography, The Artphabet is a stunning typographic project that pays homage to some of the greatest modern and contemporary artists from across the decades.\n\nWhile there are countless types of typography, this intricate project demonstrates the diversity of the craft, with each letter boasting its own character and story. From Basquiat to Frida Kahlo, the project is a playful and dynamic tribute to the greats, demonstrating how culturally influential contemporary art has become.\n\n(Image credit: Cess)\n\nCreated by C\u00e9sar Cid, creative director at 3D motion and illustration studio CESS, the project began as somewhat of a love letter to the art world. \"I have always liked the art world in general and it occurred to me that a good way to pay tribute was to participate in the 36 Days of Type event with an alphabet dedicated to the greats of modern and contemporary art,\" C\u00e9sar tells Creative Bloq.\n\nPaying homage to the greats has its challenges, as selecting one artist per letter proved a tough decision for C\u00e9sar. \"It wasn't easy for several reasons. It was clear that some artists would have to be left out,\" he says. \"When choosing which letter to assign to each artist, some of them correspond to the surname, others to the first name... it was not possible to make them all match. I also took into account the shape of the letter itself and the work I wanted to pay homage to when choosing,\" C\u00e9sar adds.\n\n(Image credit: Cess)\n\nTo create each unique letter, C\u00e9sar used a variety of tools. \"I made sketches and textures by hand and in Photoshop, with ZBrush I created many of the letters with digital sculpting.

The move came in response to President Trump, in one of his first acts in office in his second term, signing an executive order that revoked another executive order (by his predecessor Joe Biden).\n\nBiden's order required the U.S. government to set standards for the \"safety\" of AI models, and for developers of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to share with the U.S. government the results of safety tests of their AI models before releasing them to the public.\n\nWhat the new Trump executive order does\n\nIt's not 100% clear how much the Biden order cost AI companies like Alphabet's Google, which makes Gemini AI and uses it to provide quick answers to Google searches made in question form (among other uses). But it's likely that the added regulation did impose at least some costs.\n\nFor this reason, repealing the order is likely to save Google (and Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI) at least some money, boosting the company's profits incrementally. To this extent, a small boost in Alphabet's stock price seems justified.\n\nMore broadly, Trump's move may hint at a broader support by the new administration for expanding use of AI by industry, boosting Alphabet's business in ways that are yet to be seen.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy?\n\nThe question investors need to ask is whether reducing costs a bit for Google, and expanding opportunities in unknown (and unquantifiable) ways, makes Alphabet stock a \"buy\" at its current price.\n\nAnd I'm not sure if it does.\n\nValued on earnings, Alphabet stock seems not unreasonably priced at a 25.5 P/E ratio and a 17% projected long-term earnings growth rate. Problem is, Alphabet is spending a lot of money on AI investment, which dramatically depresses free cash flow to barely 60% of reported net income. Alphabet costs a pricey 43 times free cash flow currently. To my value investing eye, that's too much to pay for 17% growth.\n\nTherefore, at this price, Alphabet stock is no buy.",

            "content": "Istanbul's art scene has been enriched by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin's groundbreaking exhibition, \"Kay\u0131p Alfabe\" (\"The Lost Alphabet\"), a compelling exploration of history, identity and the fractured nature of contemporary life. Curated by Christoph Tannert, the exhibition is hosted at the historic Feshane, a restored cultural venue managed by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB). The opening of \"The Lost Alphabet\" marks a pivotal moment for Istanbul's cultural landscape, rapidly establishing Feshane as one of the city's most exciting cultural hubs. The exhibition offers a powerful commentary on the intersection of personal and collective memory, societal fractures and the complex relationship between past and present.\n\nCurrently open to the public, \"The Lost Alphabet\" runs from Jan. 17 to July 20 at Feshane in Istanbul. Supported by the DG Art Project and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Holding and directed by Angelo Bucarelli and Paola Marino, this cultural initiative provides a rare opportunity to experience G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s large-scale works and intricate installations, offering profound insights into the dynamic interplay of history, culture and memory.\n\nAn artwork titled \"Sarcophaguses of Alphabet\" by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. (Courtesy of Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin)\n\nAn artist of myth, memory\n\nAhmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin is one of T\u00fcrkiye's most acclaimed contemporary artists, celebrated for blending ancient mythologies with modern artistic expressions. His diverse body of work includes sculpture, painting, installation and video art, and he uses these mediums to explore themes of history, memory and transformation. Drawing on mythology to address contemporary issues, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin examines the connections between people, objects and memories, often questioning how these elements shape both personal and collective identities. His works, crafted from materials such as stone, metal, fabric and ceramics, reflect cycles of creation and destruction, inviting viewers to engage with the metaphysical and material aspects of the world.\n\nThe exhibition delves into how material culture mirrors historical events and societal changes. The title, \"The Lost Alphabet,\" evokes the themes of cultural memory and language loss. G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s pieces touch on migration, collective memory and the tension between history and the present, while also exploring the impact of these forces on identity. The exhibition presents everyday objects \u2013 such as shoes, street signs, gas masks and bicycles \u2013 alongside abstract and mythological references, creating a dialogue between the personal and the collective. These \"memory objects\" encourage viewers to reflect on the people and places they represent, while prompting us to reconsider how we remember, forget and interpret history.\n\nAn artwork titled \"Angels of Alphabet\" by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. (Courtesy of Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin)\n\nA key aspect of G\u00fcne\u015ftekin's practice is his focus on the materiality of memory. His use of stone, metal and fabric evokes the passage of time and the enduring imprint of history. From sculptural works that respond to the industrial past of Feshane to immersive video and sound installations, \"The Lost Alphabet\" invites viewers to engage with the tactile and temporal aspects of everyday objects, challenging traditional ideas of time and space.\n\nA distinctive strength of G\u00fcne\u015ftekin's work is his integration of mythology to explore the individual and society\u2019s sense of self. In \"The Lost Alphabet,\" he reimagines ancient myths in a contemporary context, blending them with modern themes to reflect the fragmented and sometimes illogical nature of today\u2019s world. His canvas works are filled with mythical creatures and stories, inviting the audience to reflect on how these ancient narratives resonate \u2013 or not \u2013 in the present.\n\nIn addition to mythology, the exhibition explores the concept of language, with G\u00fcne\u015ftekin examining various alphabets and scripts. His interest in language politics and the ways different writing systems have been used to assert cultural and ideological dominance throughout history is evident in his work. Through metal letters merged with soundscapes, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin challenges viewers to consider how language, in all its forms, shapes our understanding of history and identity. His exploration of endangered languages \u2013 those that have been suppressed or are at risk of disappearing \u2013 underscores the fragility of cultural heritage and the urgent need to preserve it.\n\nAn artwork titled \"Born from the Fish\" by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. (Courtesy of Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin)\n\nDialogues with material\n\nThe exhibition also features a series of sculptures that transform raw materials such as stone and metal into striking, site-specific works. Using stone formations that may be millions of years old, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin imbues them with new meanings, while his manipulation of metal structures creates visually stunning contrasts with the natural forms of the stones. The sculptures are often labyrinthine, creating a sense of movement and exploration within the space, as visitors are encouraged to navigate the works and engage with them from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe works challenge traditional ideas of space and perspective. With circular metal frameworks that encase marble and stone, the sculptures act as metaphors for the cyclical nature of history, where past, present and future are constantly in motion, influencing one another. G\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s sculptural arrangements, whether massive or intimate, are designed to create a dialogue between the works and their surroundings, inviting the audience to reflect on the material and immaterial connections between people and the objects they create.\n\nAn artwork titled \"Faces of Athena\" by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. (Courtesy of Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin)\n\n\"The Lost Alphabet\" is more than just an art exhibition; it is a cultural dialogue that invites viewers to reflect on the ongoing relationship between memory, identity and transformation. The exhibition is a space where time is not linear but fluid \u2013 where history and mythology intertwine with contemporary issues to create a multi-layered narrative.\n\nBy combining objects, sounds and visuals, G\u00fcne\u015ftekin transforms the gallery space into a living organism that evolves with the movement and perception of the audience. The exhibition challenges us to reconsider how we view the objects, symbols and language that shape our world, urging us to confront the fractured nature of history and the ways in which our identities are constructed.\n\nAs G\u00fcne\u015ftekin himself notes, \u201cThe Lost Alphabet\u201d is an invitation to pause and reflect on our shared history, to reimagine the meanings embedded in the objects around us, and to think deeply about the future that we are building from the fragments of the past. The exhibition, in its entirety, is a call to action \u2013 to remember, to question and to imagine new possibilities for what language and memory can offer in shaping a sustainable future.",

Porat highlighted that the U.S. currently leads in AI model development, estimating the lead to be over a year ahead. However, she noted that China is on par or possibly ahead in the diffusion of AI\u2019s basic capabilities across various sectors, indicating a nuanced competition where strengths vary by application and implementation.\n\nPorat emphasized that maintaining this lead is not guaranteed and requires strategic interventions. She stressed the importance of a regulatory framework that is both bold and responsible, advocating for regulations tailored to specific sectors rather than a uniform approach. According to Porat, the risks associated with AI applications in areas like email auto-complete are fundamentally different from those in healthcare, suggesting that existing regulations should be adapted rather than creating new, potentially cumbersome rules for AI applications.\n\nInvestment frameworks are another critical area, where Porat called for mechanisms that would encourage private sector capital investment while fostering public-private sector collaboration. She sees this as essential for driving innovation and ensuring that the economic potential of AI is fully realized.\n\nMoreover, Porat underscored the need for the U.S. to engage globally, not just within its borders. She noted that many countries are eager to participate in digital transformation, preferably with the U.S., but are willing to proceed independently if necessary. This international aspect, she argued, should influence U.S. policy to ensure it remains competitive and attractive for global partnerships.\n\nOn the regulatory side, Porat introduced a mnemonic \u201cFAB\u201d \u2013 Focus, Aligned, and Balanced. \u2018Focus\u2019 suggests that regulation should be sector-specific; \u2018Aligned\u2019 points to the need for consistent regulatory standards across different geographies to avoid a patchwork that might deter investors; and \u2018Balanced\u2019 refers to weighing the risks of inaction against the potential benefits of AI deployment, particularly in life-saving applications like healthcare or safety-enhancing technologies like autonomous vehicles from Waymo.\n\nPorat\u2019s insights reveal a complex landscape where maintaining AI leadership involves not just technological advancements but also strategic, regulatory, and collaborative efforts across borders. Her discussion serves as a call to action for policymakers, businesses, and investors to craft an environment where AI can thrive, innovate, and contribute to global economic and social benefits while managing risks appropriately.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

The move was widely anticipated after the president announced his intention to de-regulate industry on the campaign trail.\n\nSeveral prominent tech executives, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, contributed to Trump's campaign and attended Monday's inauguration leading some to speculate on their potential influence on the president.\n\nRead Next: UnitedHealth CEO Highlights Hospitals, Doctors, Pharma\u2019s Role In Soaring Health Care Costs\n\nWhy It Matters: Reaction to Trump's reversal of Biden's AI policies has been mixed. Some experts have expressed concern that it could leave Americans exposed to potential risks from AI as giant tech companies would operate without regulatory oversight. Others view the repeal as a positive step toward economic progress and innovation in the industry.\n\nThe repeal of Biden's AI framework may have set up a showdown with the European Union's AI act passed in 2023 which mandates transparency and bans certain uses of artificial intelligence.\n\nAI chipmakers Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD could see a boost as the loosened restrictions could encourage AI hyper-scalers to increase investments in the technology.\n\nThese hyper-scalers, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Alphabet, Inc. GOOG GOOGL, could potentially accelerate the development and deployment of AI technologies across their platforms and services as the government takes a more \"hands-off\" approach to regulation.\n\nBoth Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, were present at Trump\u2019s inauguration, suggesting potential alignment with the new administration\u2019s approach to AI regulation.\n\nThough the long-term effects of Trump's policies remain to be seen, the market is reacting positively one day after his inauguration. All three major indices are up Tuesday with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, tracking the S&P 500, up 0.51% at $600.65 and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, tracking the Nasdaq 100 index, up 0.14% at $522.49 at the time of publication Tuesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

On Jan. 14, the transaction, worth between $250,001 and $500,000, was carried out. Under same circumstances, she purchased 50 call options for Amazon (AMZN, Financials) the same day, likewise valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nBy comparison, on Dec. 31, 2024, Pelosi sold 31,600 Apple (AAPL, Financials) shares. The transaction was between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day she also sold 10,000 NVIDIA (NVDA, Financials) shares, with a transaction value ranging from $1 million to $5 million. Originally acquired on November 22, 2023, at a strike price of $12, Pelosi earlier exercised 500 call options on Nvidia, originally purchased on December 20, 2024.\n\nArtificial intelligence health startup Tempus AI (TEM, Financials), valued between $50,001 and $100,000, Congresswoman also revealed fresh investments in Palo Alto Networks (PANW, Financials), with a value between $1 million and $5 million, Vistra (VST, Financials), priced between $500,000 and $1 million. These transactions have different dates.\n\nSince July 2024, when Pelosi reported more investments in Nvidia and sales of Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), these moves are her first disclosures. 84-year-old Pelosi is still a regular player in congressional politics.",

            "content": "Quantum computing is a burgeoning field with the potential to create trillions of dollars. The rising acceptance of quantum computers in finance, life sciences and chemical sectors is expected to help the quantum computing market reach $5.3 billion by 2029 from $1.3 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 32.7%, according to marketsandmarkets.\n\nQuantum computers\u2019 inherent capability to operate faster than traditional ones has renewed interest among market participants. Qubits can show values between zero and one, while traditional bits represent only zeros and ones. However, it may take years to commercialize quantum computers due to their error-prone nature, leading investors to compare Alphabet Inc. GOOGL or Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI for the better stock option. Let\u2019s see \u2013\n\nFuture Outlook: GOOGL versus RGTI in Quantum Computing\n\nAlphabet has made substantial progress in quantum computing since founding Google Quantum AI in 2012. Notably, Alphabet\u2019s quantum chip, Willow, has gained popularity because of its error-reducing capability and potential for advancing large-scale quantum computers. Willow has successfully addressed errors faster than supercomputers, making it more beneficial. It has become one of Alphabet\u2019s best products like YouTube, Google Search and Google Cloud.\n\nRigetti, meanwhile, has introduced the Quantum Cloud Services platform, which offers significant cost savings to clients compared to traditional computer hardware. Rigetti has witnessed a rise in orders for its Novera quantum processor with 9 qubits, while the company is scaling up its business by introducing a powerful 336-qubit system in the future. Rigetti\u2019s new chip fabrication is also expected to reduce noise issues and boost revenue growth in the current and next year. So, the future holds good for both Rigetti and Alphabet in the quantum computing space.\n\nGOOGL or RGTI: Which is the Better Quantum Computing Stock?\n\nDespite a positive outlook, Alphabet has the upper hand over Rigetti. Alphabet\u2019s massive progress in cloud computing and its profitable digital ad business have increased the company\u2019s cash flows, which the company can utilize for its research and development in the quantum computing space. In contrast, smaller players like Rigetti may face cash shortages while managing a capital-intensive business and tackling operational risks.\n\nQuantum computing is a highly speculative business, and to become successful, companies need to be fundamentally sound. Alphabet has been able to keep its operational costs under control and generate profit from its sales. However, Rigetti\u2019s expenses have surpassed its revenues. After all, Alphabet\u2019s net profit margin is a positive 27.7% and Rigetti\u2019s is a negative 509.6%.",

The company started during the dot-com era.\n\nIn doing so, MicroStrategy would surpass all but four of the five biggest tech companies in the Nasdaq 100 Index in terms of outstanding shares: Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nIn October, MicroStrategy announced its plan to acquire Bitcoin with $42 billion in capital over three years through an at-the-market share issuance program and debt sales.\n\nSince then, the company has acquired tokens for 10 weeks in a row, virtually doubling its token holdings to more than $44 billion.\n\nInvestors would often be against such a planned share issuance because it reduces profits per share, equity for shareholders, and voting power.\n\nUnless investors viewed this as necessary for the company's strategy realignment, the general public and present shareholders would probably view it negatively.\n\nInvestors might not care in this case. Since launching its Bitcoin acquisition plan in 2020, MicroStrategy's share price has increased by over 2,500%, making it a favourite on Wall Street.\n\nDuring the same time period, the value of Bitcoin has climbed by around 800%.\n\nAuthorized and outstanding shares do not always match up. Nvidia has 80 billion authorized shares, whereas Alphabet has 300 billion.\n\nSome of MicroStrategy's authorized shares, which exceed 10 billion, may remain unsold.\n\nDespite having issued more than two-thirds of the allotted $21 billion worth of shares, MicroStrategy has only issued slightly more than 43 million shares through market sales since the plan began.\n\nShareholders are expected to accept an amendment on January 21 to increase the number of permitted preferred stock shares from 5 million to 1 billion.\n\nThe company developed and uses Bitcoin yield to assess its worth to shareholders. This metric tracks the change in Bitcoin holdings per diluted share over time, excluding changes in Bitcoin price. MicroStrategy pays out nonexistent dividends.\n\nDespite MicroStrategy's success in acquiring Bitcoin through stock and fixed-income security offerings, the company has limited options, with just $6.5 billion remaining in equity offerings from its $42 billion strategy.\n\nThe software division, which is the company's backbone, has lost money for the last three quarters in a row.\n\nAccording to Saylor's December interview with Bloomberg Television, the company's goal is to \"create more sophisticated leverage.\" \"\n\nTo approve the modifications regarding the increase in shares, a majority of the voting power of all outstanding common stock eligible to vote must be obtained.\n\nOn Tuesday, at 10 a.m New York time, there will be a shareholder meeting.",

            "content": "Alphabet Inc. is a holding company formed in 2015 with the restructuring of Google. The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business. Google, which began as a simple search engine, is now synonymous with the Internet, cloud, and services related to each. Today, Alphabet is the 3rd largest tech company globally and the G in FAANG.\n\nGoogle began in 1996 as a research project into Internet search. Founders Lary Page and Sergey Brin thought there was a better way to search and rank web pages than simply counting the number of times a keyword was used. The original algorithm was called Page Rank and the system Back Rub but those monickers did not last long. The new system instead determined a page's relevance by analyzing the websites that linked back to it. The more websites with higher rankings linking back to the original site the better.\n\nThe original prototype of the Google search engine was launched in 1997. The name Google was chosen because it is a very large number and refers to a large amount of information a Google search can provide. If not for an investment Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the company may never have incorporated and become the behemoth it is today.\n\nThe company grew over the next few years, changed it headquarters to Palo Alto and then began selling ad space. It was he shift to an ad-based and supported model that provided the income and earnings to grow the company to its current size. Advertising still makes up more than 80% of the revenue. In 2000, the company became the default search engine for Yahoo! and then in 2004 Google went public.\n\nAt the time of the IPO, company founders and then-CEO Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for the next 20 years. While that did not come to pass, the trio helped get the company on its current path. In the time since the IPO, Google has not only grown to surpass 3 billion daily searches and 1 billion unique monthly active users it has also acquired other businesses to enhance that growth. The two most notable are the acquisition of Youtube (which is included in the ad-generated revenue) and Motorola. The addition of Motorola was strategic in many ways that include the acquisition of intellectual property and better positioning in patent and other disputes with other tech companies.\n\nAlphabet now operates in 3 core segments providing Internet and Internet-based services globally. Those segments are Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The Google Services business is the core Google business and includes search, ads, Google Home, and Youtube among others. The Google Cloud segment is a host of cloud-based services for businesses and individuals that include software suites, security, and cloud-based operations. The Other Bets segment includes a variety of applications and services that do not have a direct bearing on the core business and/or are immaterial to revenue on an individual basis.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned +2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.93 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nStory Continues",

Countless species and civilizations have joined the vast multiverse of Dungeons and Dragons over the last 50 years, so the game has many languages \u2013 well over 60 and counting, in fact. Of those, there are 17 fully fleshed out, main ones you\u2019ll use in game \u2013 split into Standard and Exotic D&D languages. This guide explains all of them, as well as the most popular DnD alphabets, rules for learning new languages, and a list of more obscure languages from the far planes.\n\nWorth remembering here is that, in the 2014 version of the rules, the languages your character can speak are pretermined by which of the DnD races you\u2019re from. But in the newer Player\u2019s Handbook, DnD 2024 backgrounds determine this instead. In some rare cases, DnD classes can also add languages to your character\u2019s linguistic repertoire.\n\nFor full details on what\u2019s changed in the switch from classic 5e to the DnD 2024 rules, read our section on how to learn DnD languages.\n\nHere\u2019s our full handbook for DnD languages:\n\nHow many DnD languages are there?\n\nThere are 17 main languages in Dungeons and Dragons 5e \u2013 10 common and seven rare \u2013 but the total number of languages spoken in the DnD multiverse is more than 60.\n\nThe most popularly used 5e languages \u2013 called \u2018Standard\u2019 languages \u2013 are Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Orc, Draconic, and Common Sign Language.\n\nThe seven rare \u2013 or \u2018Exotic\u2019 \u2013 Dungeons and Dragons languages are Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, Deep Speech, Primordial, Sylvan, and Undercommon.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not including a huge range of minor languages and dialects spoken and written across the Forgotten Realms and various other DnD settings in Wizards of the Coast\u2019s ever growing multiverse.\n\nOnce you factor in the various hidden, little known, or esoteric 5e languages from specific sourcebooks \u2013 including those inter-dimensionally ported in from Magic: The Gathering \u2013 the total number of languages in D&D rises to over 60. To find out more about those mysterious tongues, read on!\n\nStandard DnD languages\n\nThe 10 Standard DnD languages are widely spoken across the core DnD settings, so they\u2019re all useful to learn, whether you\u2019re infiltrating an urban community or wandering through uncharted forests. Here\u2019s an overview of each standard language, which alphabets they use, and which species tend to speak them.\n\nCommon\n\nOrigin: Sigil\n\nSigil Alphabet: Common\n\nCommon is a universal DnD language spoken by most races, and unless you specify otherwise, it\u2019s usually the one you\u2019ll be assumed to be using. Being able to talk to everyone in Common is super useful, but the other standard languages can still be handy, provided you\u2019re creative.\n\nCommon Sign Language\n\nOrigin: Sigil\n\nSigil Alphabet: N/A\n\nAs the name implies, Common Sign Language is the sign equivalent of Common. The 2024 rules have made more effort to include sign language in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. For example, the Comprehend Language spell now also gives you the ability to understand sign and spoken language.\n\nDraconic\n\nOrigin: Dragons, Dragonborn\n\nDragons, Dragonborn Alphabet: Draconic\n\nYes, it\u2019s true \u2013 if you\u2019re playing a DnD Dragonborn, chances are you can talk to an actual dragon using your shared language, Draconic. Dragonborn also share ancestry with DnD Kobolds, so they can join the conversation too.\n\nDwarvish\n\nOrigin: Dwarves\n\nDwarves Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nWhile it\u2019s mainly spoken by DnD Dwarf characters, several other languages use the runic alphabet that was first used for Dwarvish. As well as being widely spoken, you\u2019ll see a lot of DnD weapons inscribed with Dwarvish runes.\n\nElvish\n\nOrigin: Elves\n\nElves Alphabet: Elvish\n\nAlso sometimes called Elven, Elvish is commonly spoken by DnD Elf characters. Long ago in Elvish history, some Elves had ties to the Feywild, so the language spoken on that plane shares the Elvish alphabet.\n\nGiant\n\nOrigin: Ogres, Giants\n\nOgres, Giants Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nGiant (or Giantish) is one of the oldest living languages in the core setting of Faer\u00fbn. Being able to speak Giant might help you avoid fighting one on your adventures \u2013 which is advisable, as they can be extremely powerful foes.\n\nGnomish\n\nOrigin: Gnomes\n\nGnomes Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nGnomish shares an alphabet with Dwarvish, but the languages are very different. Naturally, Gnomish is most commonly spoken by Gnomes, but creatures from a variety of species use Gnomish in academic writing thanks to its clear and specific vocabulary.\n\nGoblin\n\nOrigin: Goblinoids\n\nGoblinoids Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nDnD Goblins, Bugbears, and Hobgoblins all share the Goblin language. To the untrained ear, many sounds in the language resemble grunting.\n\nHalfling\n\nOrigin: Halflings\n\nHalflings Alphabet: Common\n\nGenerally, DnD Halflings are very open to learning other languages, but their species does have a language of its own. Perhaps this affability is why the Halfling language shares the Common alphabet.\n\nOrc\n\nOrigin: Orcs\n\nOrcs Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nIf you\u2019re playing an Orc or DnD Half-Orc, your native tongue is likely to be the Orc language. It\u2019s an old language that evolved from even older languages spoken by Orcs, but it shares an alphabet with Dwarvish.\n\nRare DnD languages\n\nThe Rare DnD languages \u2013 also known as Exotic Languages \u2013 are spoken in places that are less populated by average adventurers, but speaking them can often be just as useful as their Common counterparts.\n\nIf you\u2019re exploring the Feywild or the Nine Hells, chances are you\u2019ll encounter a rare language that\u2019s unique to that area \u2013 and knowing the lingo will make you a very useful party member. Here\u2019s a run through of all seven, their alphabets, and which races use each language.\n\nAbyssal\n\nOrigin: Demons\n\nDemons Alphabet: Infernal\n\nAbyssal is spoken by all demons, but its dialects sound vastly different depending on the rank of the demon speaking. Baloths, Quasits, and Nycaloths may all speak Abyssal \u2013 but very different forms of it.\n\nCelestial\n\nOrigin: Celestials\n\nCelestials Alphabet: Celestial\n\nAs the name implies, Celestials \u2013 such as Angels, Hollyphants, or Ki-rins \u2013 speak Celestial. It\u2019s also common for the odd DnD Cleric to pick it up, given its angelic origins.\n\nInfernal\n\nOrigin: Devils\n\nDevils Alphabet: Infernal\n\nDevils in the Nine Hells commonly speak and write in Infernal. Clerics of certain DnD alignments may learn this language. Plus, a DnD Warlock in a pact with a devil might find it useful to know.\n\nDeep Speech\n\nOrigin: Aberrations\n\nAberrations Alphabet: None\n\nAberrations, such as Mind Flayers and Beholders, speak the Deep Speech of the Far Realm. There is no written version of this language, though some species have created their own version as accurately as they can.\n\nPrimordial\n\nOrigin: Elementals\n\nElementals Alphabet: Dwarvish runes\n\nAll Elementals speak Primordial, but there are four core dialects, one for each elemental plane. These are:\n\nAuran \u2013 spoken by Air Elementals.\n\nAquan \u2013 spoken by Water Elementals.\n\nIgnan \u2013 spoken by Fire Elementals.\n\nTerran \u2013 spoken by Earth Elementals.\n\nThe four dialects of Primordial are closely related and mutually comprehensible \u2013 so an elemental who speaks Aquan can still communicate with one that speaks Ignan, but they remain distinct.\n\nSylvan\n\nOrigin: Fey creatures\n\nFey creatures Alphabet: Elvish\n\nFairies, Eladrin, and other creatures that originate from the Feywild tend to speak Sylvan. It shares an alphabet with Elvish.\n\nUndercommon\n\nOrigin: Underdark residents\n\nUnderdark residents Alphabet: Elvish\n\nCreatures from the Underdark, such as Drow and Duargar, typically speak Undercommon. It\u2019s a common trade language, so many creatures beyond the Underdark make the effort to learn Undercommon.\n\nCan my character speak exotic languages?\n\nThere are usually restrictions on which characters can start the game knowing exotic and rare DnD languages. The 2014 Players\u2019 Handbook suggests you should ask your DM for permission before you add one of these languages to your DnD character sheet. The 2024 rules are even more extreme, as you can\u2019t choose a rare language at all during character creation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why you\u2019d be banned from picking one, but it probably is worth having a quick discussion with your DM anyhow, for one simple reason: depending on what awaits you in the adventure, you might end up picking a language you never get to use.\n\nWhereas an imaginative player will find opportunities to use the standard D&D languages in pretty much any game, the rare languages are a bit more all-or-nothing. Many of them are mainly spoken in particular far flung regions, or specific DnD planes.\n\nDnD alphabets\n\nThere are at least 21 different DnD alphabets used across multiple languages at different times and in different areas of the DnD multiverse.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of texts characters encounter in the Forgotten Realms are written in one of three main scripts:\n\nThorass \u2013 used for Common and many of its dialects.\n\n\u2013 used for Common and many of its dialects. Espruar \u2013 the most widely used Elvish alphabet.\n\n\u2013 the most widely used Elvish alphabet. Dethek \u2013 the most widely used alphabet of Dwarvish runes.\n\nThorass\n\nBy far the most commonly used alphabet among humans on Faer\u00fbn is Thorass \u2013 it\u2019s the main script for Common, as well as many other regional human languages.\n\nEspruar\n\nThe dominant form of Elvish script in Dungeons and Dragons\u2019 Forgotten Realms setting is Espruar, used widely by all types of Elves. It\u2019s also the script most often used by non-Aberrations to write in Deep Speech, which has no written form of its own.\n\nDethek\n\nThe most prevalent alphabet of Dwarvish runes on Faer\u00fbn is Dethek. Almost all Dwarves in the Forgotten Realms write using these runes \u2013 although a very similar runic alphabet, Davek, is also sometimes used. Davek is the dominant form of Dwarvish writing on the worlds of Nerath and Eberron, and probably originated on Nerath.\n\nHow to learn DnD languages\n\nAll Dungeons and Dragons characters pick up a handful of languages during character creation. However, depending on which version of the Player\u2019s Handbook you use, these will come from different sources.\n\n5e language rules\n\nIn the 2014 rules, your character\u2019s race determines what languages they can speak. Everyone can speak Common, but they also learn at least one other language, which is usually tied to their heritage. Dragonborn speak Draconic, Gnomes speak Gnomish, and Humans can choose any extra language they like.\n\nAdditionally, some 5e backgrounds give your character an extra language to learn. An Acolyte can speak two additional DnD languages, while Nobles, Hermits, and Outlanders have one extra.\n\nA handful of classes also naturally know a secret language that\u2019s specific to their community. The Rogue 5e can communicate in Thieves\u2019 Cant, while only the Druid 5e knows how to speak Druidic. In a more unique case, the Ranger 5e\u2018s Favored Enemy ability lets them learn one language spoken by their preferred monster targets (though only in the 2014 rules).\n\nIf you want to learn a new language during your DnD campaign, you must pay an instructor one GP per day to teach you for 250 days. After this, you gain proficiency with the language of your choice.\n\nDnD 2024 languages\n\nIn the 2024 Player\u2019s Handbook, languages are not tied to any other character rules. When you create a character, they can automatically speak Common and two other languages of your choice. Crucially, these have to be from the \u2018standard\u2019 languages list.\n\nThe newer Player\u2019s Handbook doesn\u2019t include clear rules for learning new languages. However, several classes have features that can teach them new tongues:\n\nRanger \u2013 Deft Explorer gives you two extra languages\n\n\u2013 Deft Explorer gives you two extra languages Rogue \u2013 Thieves\u2019 Cant teaches you Thieves\u2019 Cant and one extra language\n\n\u2013 Thieves\u2019 Cant teaches you Thieves\u2019 Cant and one extra language Druid \u2013 You know Druidic, and you always have the spell Speak With Animals prepared\n\n\u2013 You know Druidic, and you always have the spell Speak With Animals prepared Wizard \u2013 The Diviner subclass eventually gets the Third Eye feature, which means they can read any language.\n\nWhat are the best DnD languages?\n\nThe best DnD languages for your character will depend entirely on the campaign you\u2019re playing in. Sylvan is a top-tier pick if you\u2019re about to start a Feywild campaign like The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, but it\u2019s useless if you never meet a Fey. Apart from Common (which every player-character can speak), the value of a language is situational.\n\nThat being said, there are some D&D languages that we\u2019d recommend over others:\n\nS Tier\n\nCommon \u2013 Everyone speaks it, and you automatically learn it.\n\nA Tier\n\nDraconic \u2013 You\u2019ll rarely meet a dragon that can\u2019t speak Common, but this language is also used often for magic.\n\n\u2013 You\u2019ll rarely meet a dragon that can\u2019t speak Common, but this language is also used often for magic. Giant \u2013 A common enemy type you might interact with, and some of them might not speak Common.\n\n\u2013 A common enemy type you might interact with, and some of them might not speak Common. Undercommon \u2013 Everyone in the Underdark speaks this, and many other unusual monsters share this language. Plus it has utility as a trade language.\n\nB Tier\n\nDwarvish \u2013 Most Dwarves speak Common, and there are few utility reasons to choose this language, but you\u2019ll meet Dwarves very often and might be able to impress them with your language skills. Plus, many other languages use the Dwarvish alphabet.\n\n\u2013 Most Dwarves speak Common, and there are few utility reasons to choose this language, but you\u2019ll meet Dwarves very often and might be able to impress them with your language skills. Plus, many other languages use the Dwarvish alphabet. Elvish \u2013 Ditto Dwarvish.\n\n\u2013 Ditto Dwarvish. Goblin \u2013 Another common enemy you\u2019re likely to meet, though not so much at higher levels of the campaign.\n\n\u2013 Another common enemy you\u2019re likely to meet, though not so much at higher levels of the campaign. Sylvan \u2013 You\u2019re fairly likely to encounter a Fey creature that speaks Sylvan, though this rare language is still quite situational.\n\nC Tier\n\nGnomish \u2013 Most Gnomes speak Common, and the main use of this will be to converse in secret with others who share this language.\n\n\u2013 Most Gnomes speak Common, and the main use of this will be to converse in secret with others who share this language. Halfling \u2013 Ditto Gnomish.\n\n\u2013 Ditto Gnomish. Orc \u2013 Ditto Gnomish and Halfling.\n\n\u2013 Ditto Gnomish and Halfling. Common Sign Language \u2013 Incredibly useful, but only if your group encounters Deaf characters regularly, or needs to communicate silently without using magic.\n\n\u2013 Incredibly useful, but only if your group encounters Deaf characters regularly, or needs to communicate silently without using magic.

Infernal \u2013 Ditto Abyssal.\n\n\u2013 Ditto Abyssal. Primordial \u2013 Only really spoken by elementals, a fairly rare monster to encounter. However, they\u2019re less likely to be able to speak Common than other monsters, so this can be a life-saver in the right scenario.\n\nD Tier\n\nCelestial \u2013 Meeting a celestial is an incredibly rare occurrence, and they might well be able to speak Common anyway.\n\n\u2013 Meeting a celestial is an incredibly rare occurrence, and they might well be able to speak Common anyway. Deep Speech \u2013 You might meet a Mind Flayer, but they probably don\u2019t want to chat. Beholders also speak this language, but they\u2019re likely to know several more common languages, too.\n\nOther DnD languages\n\nThere are a huge number of obscure languages in the various DnD books and settings. Some of these are used by rarer races \u2013 Aarakocra and Minotaurs have their own languages, for example. Many monsters have their own individual languages, though these are difficult to learn without a special ability (such as the Ranger\u2019s Favored Enemy). Other DnD languages are found on entirely different planes and planets from Faer\u00fbn.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason these extra-rare languages can only be found in additional sourcebooks. Generally, you wouldn\u2019t choose these languages for your character unless you\u2019re from the planet or land they originate in. Maybe you\u2019re planning to hop planes or visit a new planet in your Spelljammer, but unless you know the language will be useful, we\u2019d recommend something more general.\n\nThere are so many possible languages that we aren\u2019t able to list all of them here. However, we have listed the most common ones you might want to speak if your character belongs to a certain species, culture, or campaign. We\u2019ve also pointed out which sourcebooks they come from.\n\nHere are some of the other languages you might encounter in 5e:\n\nTheros languages\n\nFound in: Mythic Odysseys of Theros\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Leonin Leonin Common\n\nRavnica languages\n\nFound in: Guildmaster\u2019s Guide to Ravnica\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Kraul Kraul Kraul Loxodon Loxodon Elvish Merfolk Merfolk Merfolk Sphinx Sphinxes None Vedalken Vedalken Vedalken\n\nKrynn languages\n\nFound in: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Abanasinia Abanasinians Common Ergot Ergoth People Common Kharolian People from the Planes of Dust and Tarsis Common Kenderspeak Kender Common Khur Khur Istarian Nordmaarian Nordmaar People Istarian Solamnic Solamnian People Common\n\nEberron languages\n\nFound in: Wayfinder\u2019s Guide to Eberron\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Riedran Lower-class citizens of Sarlona Common Quori Quori, Inspired, Kalashtar Quori\n\nWildspace languages\n\nFound in: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Thri-kreen Thri-kreen None\n\nFound in: Mordenkainen\u2019s Tome of Foes\n\nLanguage Main speakers Alphabet Gith Githyanki, Githzerai Tir\u2019su\n\nForgotten Realms languages\n\nFound in: Sword Coast Adventurer\u2019s Guide\n\nThese languages are optional Human languages your campaign could use instead of assuming that everyone speaks Common.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. Traditional computer bits can only hold zeros or ones. However, quantum bits, commonly called qubits, can represent any value between zero and one. This advancement enables exponentially faster computing speeds in comparison to traditional computers.\n\nThe problem lies with stability, as the more qubits a computer can process, the more error-prone it becomes. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability.\n\nFortunately, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. With that development, Alphabet could be the most successful quantum computing stock in 2025. Here's why.\n\nAlphabet and quantum computing\n\nIndeed, consumers and investors know Alphabet best for products like Google Search, YouTube, the Android operating system, and Google Cloud. Nonetheless, the company founded Google Quantum AI in 2012 and has researched the technology and built computers since that time.\n\nMost of the focus on Alphabet in the quantum computing space revolves around Willow, its quantum chip. Willow stands out because it reduces errors as it adds qubits. This stands in contrast to past quantum chips, whose error rates increased as the number of qubits rose.\n\nAdditionally, Willow carried out a standard benchmark calculation in around five minutes. This is notable as it estimates that the fastest supercomputers in use today would take 10 septillion (10^25) years to perform the same calculation, a period longer than the entire history of the universe.\n\nAdmittedly, quantum computing is a technology in search of real-world applications. Still, the ability to address the error issues bodes well for Alphabet's efforts to make quantum computing both beneficial and profitable.\n\nThe numbers on Alphabet's side\n\nMoreover, with commercial viability likely years away, the company's other attributes may take a front seat in 2025 as quantum computing-related efforts remain focused on research and development.\n\nIndeed, a massive and highly profitable digital ad business will probably help fund the company's research. Also, a fast-growing Google Cloud enterprise contributes increasing shares of revenue and has made Alphabet increasingly critical in the IT world with its presence in the cloud and longtime innovation in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThanks to the success of those businesses, Alphabet held $93 billion in liquidity as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. Furthermore, it generated almost $62 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 alone. Those assets put Alphabet in a strong position to fund quantum computing and any supporting technologies.\n\nThis places it in stark contrast to a quantum computing start-up such as IonQ. Although IonQ's ties to academia have helped it develop faster quantum computers, its considerable losses could mean it runs out of money before it can apply the technology commercially.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock rose nearly 40% over the last year, beating the S&P 500. Despite those gains, its P/E ratio at this writing is 26, making it the cheapest stock by that measurement among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nWinning with Alphabet in 2025\n\nThanks to Willow and the resources and talent that made it possible, Alphabet could easily become the quantum winner of 2025.\n\nThe release of Willow and its success in addressing the error-prone nature of quantum computing chips likely makes the Google parent the leading company in this industry in 2025.\n\nMoreover, even if commercial viability is years away, its lucrative digital advertising and cloud business will probably bolster its massive free cash flow, which will help fund more research in quantum computing and the technologies that should help make it useful for commercial purposes.\n\nFinally, the fact that Alphabet offers the lowest P/E ratio among Magnificent Seven stocks provides investors with an added incentive to buy the stock.\n\nWhen considering this low valuation and its apparent technical lead, quantum computing investors appear to have the best chance of succeeding with Alphabet in 2025.",

            "content": "Investors are buzzing about the future of quantum computing, and Alphabet Inc. is in the spotlight. While traditional bits can only represent either a zero or a one, quantum bits, or qubits, can embody a range of values between them. This groundbreaking capability allows quantum computers to process information at speeds unimaginable for today\u2019s devices.\n\nHowever, as systems gain more qubits, they often encounter stability issues, leading to increased errors. Most experts agree that widespread commercial use of quantum technology is still several years away. Fortunately, Alphabet has made significant strides with its innovative quantum chip, Willow, which could position the company as a leader in this emerging field.\n\nSince launching the Google Quantum AI initiative in 2012, Alphabet has been at the forefront of quantum research. Willow is particularly noteworthy for effectively minimizing errors as more qubits are incorporated, a substantial improvement over previous generations of quantum chips. For example, while modern supercomputers would need an inconceivable amount of time \u2014 over 10 septillion years \u2014 to execute a simple benchmark calculation, Willow completes it in just five minutes.\n\nEven with quantum computing still in its infancy, Alphabet\u2019s robust business model allows it to fuel its technological ambitions. The company boasts a thriving digital advertising sector and rapidly expanding Google Cloud services, with liquidity of $93 billion as of Q3 2024.\n\nGiven its unique position, Alphabet could emerge as the top choice in quantum computing by 2025. With its competitive P/E ratio and strong cash flow, the tech giant offers an attractive investment opportunity amidst the quantum computing revolution.\n\nThe Broader Implications of Quantum Computing\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a quantum computing revolution, the implications extend far beyond mere technological advancement. The advent of quantum computing has the potential to redefine societal structures, influence cultural paradigms, and reshape the global economy. With its ability to solve complex problems at unprecedented speeds, quantum computing could revolutionize sectors such as pharmaceuticals, financial services, and cybersecurity.\n\nIn health care, for example, quantum algorithms can analyze vast data sets for drug discovery, significantly accelerating the process of bringing new medications to market. This could lower costs and improve patient outcomes, marking a monumental shift in how medical research is conducted. In finance, quantum computing may optimize trading strategies and risk assessments, leading to more stable financial markets.\n\nHowever, the environmental impact of developing and scaling quantum technology needs consideration. The increase in resource consumption associated with quantum hardware production and the energy-intensive nature of cooling systems could raise sustainability concerns. Companies like Alphabet have an opportunity\u2014and a responsibility\u2014to implement green technologies in their quantum initiatives.\n\nLooking forward, the trajectory of quantum computing development is likely to foster new trends in international competition, as nations race to harness this powerful technology. The potential for economic disruption is considerable, as industries adapt to leverage quantum capabilities, radically altering job landscapes and economic power dynamics globally. In this high-stakes environment, those who invest wisely today may well shape the future tomorrow.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Quantum Leap: The Future of Computing is Here\n\nThe Rise of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computing is poised to revolutionize the technological landscape, particularly through advancements made by Alphabet Inc. This transformative technology utilizes quantum bits, or qubits, which possess the unique ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling unparalleled processing capabilities compared to traditional computers. This shift in computation has the potential to address complex problems in various fields such as cryptography, materials science, and optimization.\n\nKey Features of Quantum Computing\n\n1. Superposition: Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time. This characteristic allows quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously, drastically speeding up the process.\n\n2. Entanglement: Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another. This phenomenon can lead to faster information processing and more robust data encryption methods.\n\n3. Quantum Supremacy: Google claimed to achieve quantum supremacy in 2019 when its quantum processor, Sycamore, performed a specific task faster than the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.

            "content": "Perplexity AI, a new rival to Alphabet's Google in the internet search market, on Saturday submitted a bid to TikTok parent ByteDance seeking a merger with the U.S. business of the social media firm, according to a CNBC report. With TikTok, Perplexity could emerge as a stronger rival to Alphabet (GOOGL) , a potential blow to Google stock.\n\nStarted in 2022, Perplexity is both a search engine and AI chatbot. It recently launched a shopping assistant supported by payment firm Stripe.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld the federal law that will ban TikTok unless the China-based parent company sells the popular short video app's U.S. operations. TikTok late Saturday said it has temporarily shut down U.S. operations. President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he plans to give ByteDance more time to resolve issues. He takes office on Monday.\n\nCongress passed the law banning TikTok on national security grounds. Lawmakers have demanded that TikTok take steps to prevent the sharing of data from U.S. users with the Chinese government. A TikTok ban or sale could boost social media stocks such as Meta Platforms (META) and Snap (SNAP).\n\nFurther, Oracle (ORCL) would take a financial hit if TikTok shuts downs temporarily or for a long time. Oracle provides cloud computing services to TikTok.\n\nBezos, Nvidia Among Perplexity Investors\n\nPerplexity's proposal would create a new merged entity also including new capital partners, according to a report.\n\nPerplexity holds a $8 billion valuation after its latest funding round. Its early investors included Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Nvidia (NVDA) and the venture firm New Enterprise Associates.\n\nByteDance reportedly has explored the option of a TikTok deal with Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk, who has emerged as a key advisor to Trump. Musk owns social media platform X, formerly called Twitter.\n\nTo finance a deal with TikTok-parent ByteDance, Perplexity would need to line up support from deep-pocketed investors.\n\n\"We see the Perplexity bid as having no chance given its inherent value is too low for what likely is a $40 billion-plus deal,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told IBD in an email. \"Musk is a front runner in what could be a very competitive bid process for TikTok\"\n\nGoogle Stock: Big 2024 Gain\n\nFurther, Bezos and Musk are long-time rivals, competing in the space industry and elsewhere. Musk founded SpaceX while Bezos started Blue Origin. Both are working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as part of its lunar-exploration campaign.\n\nLike startup OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity provides answers to questions based on information it gathers from searching the web. OpenAI recently raised $6.6 billion in new funding, valuing the startup at $157 billion. OpenAI's biggest investor is Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nGoogle stock has gained 3.5% in 2025. Shares jumped 37% last year. GOOGL stock has five-weeks-tight pattern with a 201.42 buy point that could turn into a flat base after next week.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nLearn The Best Trading Stock Rules From IBD's Investor's Corner\n\nWant To Trade Options?

            "content": "If you've been paying attention to the markets in the past few years, then you know just how much some of the most dominant technology companies' shares have climbed. Investors looking to put money to work might be discouraged by all the bullish fever.\n\nHowever, there's a cheap stock that you've undoubtedly heard of that deserves some attention. Is it a no-brainer buying opportunity in 2025?\n\nWhy the discount?\n\nIn the past five years, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock has climbed 169% higher. That's a better gain than the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index. But even after such a fantastic return, as well as a market cap of $2.4 trillion, the internet giant looks like a worthy investment candidate.\n\nShares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.6, which is much cheaper than they were three years ago. The Nasdaq-100 index, on the other hand, carries a forward P/E ratio of 25.1.\n\nIt makes zero sense why one of the world's most successful enterprises sells at a discounted valuation. This setup would be understandable if Alphabet's growth were going to fall off a cliff. But this doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company's revenue and earnings per share are projected to rise at compound annual rates of 11.2% and 13.2%, respectively, between 2024 and 2026. And given that both those figures increased at a brisk pace historically, it's not unreasonable to assume those double-digit growth prospects can continue throughout the back half of this decade.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nAlphabet isn't a dominant business for no reason. It possesses sustainable competitive advantages that protect it from the constant threat of disruption in an ever-changing tech landscape.\n\nThe company has perhaps one of the widest economic moats around. A key component of this is the presence of network effects. This is prevalent in Google Search, the crown jewel segment.\n\nThe amount of information out there seems to be rising at an exponential pace. Google Search's ability to organize this and make it accessible to consumers across the globe provides immense value. And over time, the company's ability to improve its algorithms makes the experience better for internet surfers. This creates a positive feedback loop.\n\nNetwork effects also underpin YouTube's moat. As more content creators post more videos, it draws in a wider audience that spends more time viewing. This in turn incentivizes content creators to do even more. Both Google Search and YouTube essentially become more valuable as more people use them, which makes it very difficult for anyone to displace them.\n\nStory Continues",

Over time, compounding can significantly amplify returns, paving the way for a comfortable retirement.\n\nTo amass a portfolio worth $1 million within ten years, an initial investment of around $200,000 is advisable. Assuming you manage a consistent 20% annual return, that starting amount can flourish into a substantial sum. While this level of return is challenging, it\u2019s within reach, especially when investing in robust market leaders.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Dominance in AI\n\nNvidia stands out as a leader in artificial intelligence hardware. Its GPUs dominate the sector, with a staggering 90% market share last year. Beyond powerful chips, Nvidia has established a significant competitive edge through its CUDA software, which has become an industry standard for AI applications.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Evolution\n\nMicrosoft also excels, boasting a commanding position in productivity software via Microsoft 365 and its familiar Windows operating system. With over 80 million subscribers and impressive revenue from its cloud platform, Azure, Microsoft is well-positioned for growth, especially with its ambitious $80 billion investment in AI data centers this year.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Advertising Power\n\nLastly, Alphabet reigns as the top digital advertising titan thanks to its Google Search and YouTube. With the emergence of AI technologies like Gemini, coupled with advancements in autonomous driving and quantum computing via its Waymo and Willow units, Alphabet is set to leverage these innovations for robust future growth.\n\nThe Broader Implications of Financial Investment Trends\n\nThe rise of technology giants in the AI space is not just a boon for investors; it reshapes society and culture in profound ways. As Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet push the envelope in artificial intelligence, employment landscapes are transforming. Jobs are increasingly requiring tech proficiency, leading to heightened demands for STEM education and skills training. This shift not only impacts individuals but also influences educational institutions and policymakers striving to prepare the next generation for a digital economy.\n\nOn a global scale, the financial success of these companies fosters a culture of innovation. As capital flows into sectors like AI, countries focusing on technology can bolster their economies. The competitive edge gained from AI may widen the gap between nations, prompting discussions about economic equality and the digital divide. With wealth concentrated in tech hubs, rural and underserved areas might struggle to attract investment and talent.\n\nFurther, the environmental implications of this tech boom cannot be overlooked. As data centers expand to accommodate burgeoning AI capabilities, energy consumption surges, raising concerns about sustainability. Future trends suggest that companies will face increasing pressure to invest in green technologies and renewable energy sources to minimize their carbon footprints.\n\nUltimately, the long-term significance of these investment trends is clear: they will redefine not only market dynamics but also the very fabric of our society, urging a reevaluation of our values as we navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world.\n\nUnlocking Wealth: The Secrets to Building a Million-Dollar Portfolio\n\nAchieving financial independence and reaching a portfolio worth $1 million is a goal many aspire to, and it involves strategic planning and smart investing. One of the essential elements to consider in this journey is the concept of compound growth, which refers to earning returns on both initial investments and reinvested returns. This powerful financial principle can help accelerate wealth accumulation over time, especially when paired with disciplined investing.\n\nThe Power of Compounding: How it Works\n\nCompounding can significantly enhance your investment returns, allowing your money to grow exponentially. For example, if you start with an initial investment of $200,000 and aim for a 20% annual return, you can potentially reach $1 million in just ten years. Achieving a consistent 20% return may seem formidable, but focusing on high-quality growth stocks and innovative industries can create opportunities for substantial growth.\n\nInvestment Strategies for Success\n\n1. Diversification: Spreading your investments across various sectors can reduce risk and expose you to different growth opportunities.\n\n2. Growth-oriented Stocks: Invest in companies leading innovation, especially in fields like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy.\n\n3. Regular Contributions: Contributing consistently, even small amounts, can harness the power of compounding and enhance your portfolio over the long term.\n\n4. Long-term Vision: Holding investments for longer periods can yield better returns compared to frequent trading.\n\nKey Market Leaders to Consider\n\nNvidia: The AI Hardware Powerhouse\n\nNvidia commands a significant share of the artificial intelligence hardware market, boasting a staggering 90% market share in 2022. Its GPUs are integral to the AI sector, and its proprietary CUDA software has set the industry standard, making Nvidia a pivotal player in AI development. As AI continues to evolve, Nvidia is expected to maintain a leading edge, and investing in its stock could prove lucrative.\n\nMicrosoft: Cloud and Software Innovator\n\nMicrosoft has transformed into a dominant force in productivity software with its Microsoft 365 and Azure cloud platform. With over 80 million subscribers, Microsoft is not only securing a steady revenue stream but is also actively investing $80 billion in its AI data centers. This commitment to technology and innovation positions Microsoft as a strong contender for future growth.\n\nAlphabet: Digital Advertising and Beyond\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, leads the global digital advertising market, aided by its powerful tools like Search and YouTube. With the integration of AI technologies, such as the Gemini platform, along with endeavors in autonomous driving through Waymo and ventures in quantum computing with Willow, Alphabet is poised for significant growth. Investing in this company provides exposure to multiple high-growth sectors.\n\nConclusion: Safeguarding Your Investments\n\nWhile the prospects of building a million-dollar portfolio are enticing, it is crucial to remain vigilant regarding market fluctuations and potential risks. Legal and financial advisory can further enhance your investment strategy. By prioritizing education and staying informed about market trends, you can make wise decisions that leverage opportunities available in the market.\n\nFor more insights and detailed strategies on wealth building, you can visit Investopedia.",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 18 Stocks As Inflation Dropped. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the show by commenting on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. The CPI is an inflation measurement, and the data for December saw prices rise by 0.4% monthly and 2.9% yearly. The monthly figure was above economist expectations of 0.3% while the annual figure was in-line. Naturally, this would suggest positive market movement but the investor reaction was muted. Commenting on the reaction, Cramer shared: \u201cLook what can I say. People told me that, again and again, if it just came in in-line that would be bad. That turned out to be a great mis-judgement. An in-line number in an atmosphere where we felt that things are going to, that everything\u2019s going to go explode to the top and we\u2019re going to be seeing five percent on the ten-year and six percent on the thirty, all these crazy things. All of the table, at least for today.\u201d\n\nCramer added that market sentiment is at opposite ends when it comes to interest rates and earnings. This is because Investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to cut interest rates by much this year. According to him, \u201cWhen I look at this market. . . there was a tremendous amount of negativity about interest rates but positivity about earnings. If you take the negativity about interest rates off, you look at the earnings that we saw this morning, people are going to be pretty optimistic. And it might be sustainable throughout, I don\u2019t know, a little while. These are great numbers that we saw this morning.\u201d\n\nThe day had started with big banks releasing a set of earnings release that sent their stocks soaring. However, Cramer\u2019s co-host, David Faber, cautioned that when he previously appreciated positive bank earnings, the stocks ended up dipping in the aftermath. Cramer responded by agreeing with Faber\u2019s assessment and adding \u201cI think the difference might be that the tone of the comments at least from what I\u2019ve talked to the, from the CEOs, on the calls, will be a little more positive. For something that we, I think we all struggle to try to get a handle on which is this notion of animal spirits. [The] Notion of optimism.\u201d\n\nHe linked some of the optimism with the perception of the incoming administration being more friendly towards banks when it came to regulation. \u201cYou know, Carl, when you see CEOs, you try to figure out what\u2019s happening in the country since the election. And you hear people say listen it\u2019s a peaceful transition, you hear people say it\u2019s a much better environment for deals,\u201d Cramer commented. He added \u201cBut I come back and just say, what\u2019s really going on is a belief that it, when it comes to the banks, that there was some sort of tyrannical regime. . . If they are gone, then maybe there is a runway for more than just one quarter\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nThe change in government makes Cramer cautiously optimistic about the banking industry. According to him \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be too optimistic, ever, because the bank stocks have let us down by say ten thirty, eleven in the morning. But so far it\u2019s a different attitude is what I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d\n\nSince he was spending another day at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, when asked about some of his biggest takeaways from the event, Cramer responded:\n\n\u201cI would not want to be in the processed food business. I think that this is about, let\u2019s get diet and exercise. If that doesn\u2019t work, then let\u2019s go vaccine. And let\u2019s go inoculation. Diet and exercise being front and center to wean off what the packaged food people have done to our country. That\u2019s his [RFK Jr.] view. That\u2019s not necessarily my view. I think that these companies do, they do things that I didn\u2019t want my kids to be addicted to Cheerios. Well actually Froot Loops. But I think what\u2019s really going on David is it\u2019s the regime of what we can do for ourselves versus what happens if you can\u2019t kick obesity. What happens if you can\u2019t kick diabetes.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the world\u2019s largest search engine company. 2024 was a rough year for the stock as it struggled from headwinds stemming from a Justice Department lawsuit that generated reports that it might have to sell businesses like its Chrome browser. However, December was a great month for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s shares which soared by 11.4% after the firm announced its Willow quantum computing chip. Willow, which is designed and manufactured by Google, is capable of performing tasks that take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years less than five minutes. Cramer believes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the only stock for those interested in quantum computing:\n\n\u201cBut the idea that this is quantum\u2019s hour, they\u2019re the only, well it\u2019s easy to say it [inaudible], the problem is, is it commercial? And there isn\u2019t anyone who thinks that the companies that are currently trading are commercial companies. If you wanna play it, go own, go own Google.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 5th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues",

Their segment began on a tender note as hosts Ant and Dec surprised them with a backstage meet-up involving both their families, who were interacting for the first time.\n\nSelf-professed Jane McDonald superfan Tim had another reason to smile when the Loose Women star graced the show with an unexpected appearance to root for the lovebirds from behind the scenes, nestled in between the couple's mothers.\n\nHowever, despite the jubilee atmosphere on the set, fans were swift to head online expressing their frustration at how Karis and Tim went about tackling what appeared to be a straightforward question just minutes in to the episode.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe pair's first question to ascend the ladder was 'How many words are there in the NATO phonetic alphabet?', which prompted Karis to start listing the entire alphabet, one phonetic word at a time, reports Bristol Live.\n\nThe twosome eventually hit the mark with the answer 26, yet the route they took to get there irritated faithful viewers, who noted that a simple recollection of the total numbers in the alphabet would have sufficed instead of listing every single phonetic term.\n\n\"That's a very easy start - why she trying to remember letters?\" asked one viewer, as another penned: \"Anyone who takes that long to work out how many letters there are in the alphabet doesn\u2019t deserve the money.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Was counting the letters in the alphabet really necessary?\" enquired another ITV fan. \"26 letters - 26 words,\" stated another. \"I swear the contestants on #limitlesswin just over think every question,\" voiced one viewer.\n\nBefore their stint on the episode, the couple divulged what they believed to be their strong points as a team.\n\n\"We know that we work very well together; especially under pressure. We can make quick decisions, if we don't know something we have that trust in each other where we can be comfortable saying 'I don't think that is the answer',\" Tim revealed.\n\nLimitless Win airs on ITV from 8.30pm to 9.30pm on Saturdays",

Once you name the enemy, you can deal with it a lot better.\u201d\n\nIt was theme he hit upon in The Alphabet. He painted Peggy white and filmed her in a black-painted room painted. She lies in bed, her whiteness appearing ghostly against the inky black around her. The film turns to animation an collage before a supernatural alphabet plays havoc with Peggy\u2019s sensibilities. We see sheets splattered in blood. The sound of a baby crying is a recording Lynch\u2019s newborn daughter Jennifer.",

            "content": "Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%), known for its Google subsidiary, are up an impressive 34% in the past year and currently trading just a few points from their all-time high.\n\nDespite facing heightened regulatory scrutiny and questions about whether its core search business is losing its relevancy in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet giant continues to post strong growth and record profitability.\n\nCan the rally in Alphabet shares keep going in 2025? Let's explore where the stock might be in one year.\n\nAn AI-powered earnings juggernaut\n\nAlphabet stands out through an extensive ecosystem of products and services. The company's flagship search platform, complemented by the Chrome browser and Android operating system, creates a seamless user experience. Its cloud computing division has emerged as a major player in enterprise services, while YouTube has evolved into a social media powerhouse. Alphabet's ownership of autonomous driving venture Waymo demonstrates its commitment to continued innovation.\n\nThis reach is a key part of the company's allure as an investment, with its ability to leverage synergies supporting its market-leading advertising network. Alphabet is investing heavily in AI as a key part of its growth strategy, which has already proven successful in improving operating and financial performance. New AI-powered capabilities integrated across the ecosystem enhance user engagement, while AI-optimized search algorithms work to boost advertising conversion rates.\n\nThe most significant impact is evident in Google Cloud, where a suite of AI and machine learning tools has seen exceptional demand from customers seeking to integrate AI into their applications and workflows.\n\nThe result is not only an ongoing diversification beyond advertising revenue but also a shift in higher operating margins as Alphabet assumes a decisively more high-tech profile. In the latest reported period -- third quarter of 2024 -- revenue climbed by 15% year over year, propelling a 37% increase in earnings per share (EPS).\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai described current trends as \"extraordinary,\" projecting confidence in the company's forward outlook. Wall Street analysts anticipate continued momentum in 2025 with 11.6% revenue growth and an EPS target of $8.99, a solid 12.5% year-over-year increase.\n\nMetric 2024 Estimate 2025 Estimate Revenue (in billions) $350.2 $390.7 Revenue growth (YOY) 13.9% 11.6% Earnings per share (EPS) $7.99 $8.99 EPS growth (YOY) 37.8% 12.5%\n\nA mega-cap tech bargain\n\nBy many indications, Alphabet is firing on all cylinders, demonstrating its impressive ability to navigate the evolving AI-focused tech landscape. That being said, the company's success level and ongoing dominance in areas like search and advertising have drawn antitrust scrutiny from regulators worldwide, with several ongoing investigations regarding perceived anti-competitive practices.\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Justice has pushed for a company sale of its Chrome browser, also ruling that Google holds a monopoly in the search market. Separately, the European Union is probing Google AI's compliance with data privacy laws. While no action has been confirmed with room for appeals, the headlines cast a shadow of uncertainty.\n\nThat dynamic may explain why shares of Alphabet trade at just 21 times its consensus 2025 EPS as a forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio. This level represents a large discount to mega-cap tech peers, including internet advertising peer Meta Platforms, which trades at a forward P/E of 23, and Microsoft, with an earnings multiple closer to 32.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a good argument that Alphabet is fundamentally undervalued. Even in a scenario where the company is forced to sell off a particular product or service, the understanding is that shareholders would retain the underlying value with its assets independently commanding a sales premium.\n\nOn the other hand, a less drastic outcome that just requires the elimination of certain types of exclusive contracts or new requirements to facilitate access to competing platforms would likely be seen as bullish by the market. In my opinion, Alphabet in 2025 is sufficiently diversified that its long-term potential is as robust as ever.\n\nMy prediction for Alphabet stock\n\nGiven Alphabet's strong fundamentals, AI leadership, and attractive valuation relative to peers, I believe its strengths outweigh the risks that are simply a reality of investing in the stock market. As long as the economic environment remains resilient, the company is well positioned to generate sustained profitable growth and reward shareholders. I predict Alphabet will be trading at a higher share price in one year.",

In 2024, the US economy was stronger than expected; the large-cap stocks led the robust U.S. equities markets.

            "content": "At the heart of MicroStrategy Inc.\u2019s strategy lies an aggressive push towards Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation, masterminded by its co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylor. With a shareholder vote scheduled for Jan. 21, the company is poised to significantly expand its share authorization from 330 million to 10.3 billion Class A common shares. This move, as noted by a Bloomberg report, would position MicroStrategy (MSTR) with more shares potentially outstanding than many of the tech giants in the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX), excluding Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGLE, GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nSaylor\u2019s control over approximately 47% of the voting power through Class B shares ensures that this proposal is likely to pass, giving MicroStrategy a vast arsenal of shares to fuel its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Since announcing its $42 billion capital-raising plan in October to buy Bitcoin over three years, MicroStrategy has nearly doubled its Bitcoin holdings to over $44 billion, leveraging both equity and debt markets. It has accomplished this through ten consecutive weekly purchases, showcasing an unwavering commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy.\n\nBloomberg notes that generally, such a dramatic increase in share count would be met with investor skepticism due to the dilution of earnings per share, shareholder equity, and voting rights. However, MicroStrategy\u2019s case is unique. The company\u2019s stock has soared by more than 2,500% since it began its Bitcoin strategy in 2020, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s own rally of nearly 800%. This has turned MicroStrategy into a Wall Street favorite, with investors seemingly more focused on the potential for continued Bitcoin value growth than on dilution effects.\n\nThe gap between shares authorized and those actually issued can be substantial, as seen with tech behemoths like Alphabet and Nvidia. MicroStrategy\u2019s plan to authorize over 10 billion shares doesn\u2019t mean they will all be sold immediately, but it provides a buffer for future financial maneuvers. To date, only just over 43 million additional shares have been issued through at-the-market sales since the plan\u2019s inception.\n\nFurther complicating the shareholder dynamics, Class A shareholders have minimal power compared to Class B, which Saylor almost entirely controls. This imbalance will become even more pronounced with the planned issuance of up to $2 billion in perpetual preferred stock, which will rank senior to Class A shares. Additionally, the vote on Jan. 21 will address increasing the number of authorized preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion, broadening MicroStrategy\u2019s financial strategy options.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s approach to measuring success through its proprietary \u201cBitcoin yield\u201d metric, which tracks the increase in Bitcoin per diluted share, underscores its focus on Bitcoin\u2019s value rather than traditional financial metrics like dividends, which it does not pay.\n\nHowever, this strategy is not without its critics. Michael Lebowitz from RIA Advisors told B\u2019berg that while such a massive share increase is unprecedented, it might reduce the leverage that has made MicroStrategy attractive, potentially altering investor perception of the company\u2019s risk profile. The company\u2019s underlying software business has reported losses, limiting its traditional revenue streams and making it heavily reliant on its Bitcoin strategy for growth.\n\nSaylor has expressed intentions to maintain or increase \u201cintelligent leverage,\u201d suggesting a nuanced approach to balancing equity and debt to continue driving Bitcoin acquisitions. For the amendments to pass, they require a majority vote from the holders of all outstanding common stock, reflecting the democratic, yet heavily Saylor-influenced, decision-making process at MicroStrategy.\n\nThis strategic pivot by MicroStrategy under Saylor\u2019s guidance represents not just a financial maneuver but a bold statement on the future of corporate finance intertwined with digital assets.\n\nPrice Action: As of press time, MSTR is changing hands at $391.32, up $24.37 or 6.64% intraday.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

META reportedly stands to gain significantly if TikTok, a popular social media platform, is banned from U.S. app stores this Sunday.\n\nWhat Happened: TikTok\u2019s legal team warned that the app could \u201cgo dark,\u201d cutting off access for existing users to view videos. Such a ban would significantly affect one of the largest social media platforms in the U.S., potentially freeing up billions in ad revenue and user engagement, according to an analysis by eMarketer on Friday, reported Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the analysis, TikTok raked in $12.34 billion in U.S. ad revenue in 2024. If the app faces a ban, an estimated $6.17 billion to $8.64 billion in ad spending could be redirected. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, stands to capture a significant share, potentially gaining between $2.46 billion and $3.38 billion in ad revenue.\n\nSee Also: MrBeast Unveils Mystery Box Giveaway To Celebrate Beast Games Episode 6 Release On Amazon Prime Video\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts also predict that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company would emerge as the \u201clargest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban,\u201d leveraging its extensive user base and robust data capabilities. They estimate such a ban could boost Meta\u2019s earnings per share by 5% to 9% in the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nInstagram is projected to absorb a significant portion of the time U.S. users currently spend on TikTok. In 2024, TikTok users in the U.S. averaged nearly an hour daily on the app, with almost 75% also active on Instagram, according to EMARKETER.\n\nWhile Meta is poised to gain the most, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google\u2019s YouTube and Snap Inc.\u2019s SNAP Snapchat could also benefit from TikTok\u2019s absence.\n\nWhy It Matters: The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling on Friday that TikTok would be banned in the country unless the parent company ByteDance sold off the American portion of the business. This decision is based on \u201cwell-supported national security concerns\u201d regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and its relationship with a foreign adversary,\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, also demanded a ban on TikTok, calling it a \u201cnational security risk\u201d amid reports that Elon Musk may buy it.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the looming ban has already had an impact. VPN searches have skyrocketed by 800% as users seek workarounds, and TikTok has announced plans to cease operations in the U.S., although users can still download their personal data.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock",

            "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks had an outsized influence on the broader market in 2024, with investors piling into these high-flying artificial intelligence-influenced stocks. Their influence has swelled and these seven stocks now represent about one-third of the overall value of the broader benchmark S&P 500. That meant they had a big role in maintaining the bull market now well underway.\n\nHowever, as Treasury yields have risen to start 2025, some investors have begun debating whether the bull market can last. They wonder if a correction led by a sell-off in the Magnificent Seven is only a matter of time.\n\nIt's always tough to predict what will happen in the near term with the market, but many analysts are still bullish on the Magnificent Seven names and think this market exuberance still has justification. In particular, Wall Street analysts seem optimistic about the tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%), now the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. One thinks its stock price could vault 26% over the next year or so to $240. Here's why.\n\nOverhang from DOJ lawsuit\n\nAlphabet stock underperformed its peers in 2024 partly due to concerns about the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit and partly over concerns about upstart search engine competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It now trades at the cheapest forward earnings multiple in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe DOJ sued Alphabet's Google in 2023, alleging the company monopolized the digital advertising space by using its size and dominance to take out competitors, essentially forcing publishers to use its advertising tools and holding unfair control over pricing. In August of 2024, a judge ruled in favor of the DOJ, saying that Google is indeed a monopoly and that its power led to higher ad pricing. What really worried investors was a request from the DOJ that Google be forced to sell its Chrome browser, which would significantly impact the company and the digital advertising space.\n\nMost experts and analysts following the case view this as an unlikely outcome. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note in late November that he thought the DOJ was overreaching. \"The DOJ remedies are, in our view, a wish list of restrictions on Google that stray well beyond the court's ruling.\" Analysts aren't alone. Cornell antitrust law professor Erik Hovenkamp recently told TechTarget that most judges typically don't want to break up a large company that consumers use every day, but would \"rather take a more surgical approach\" to remedying the issue. Also, Google plans to fight the DOJ's request and the lawsuit, and it has significant resources to do so.\n\nThe AI thesis is intact\n\nMore bullish analysts think investors will soon have the lawsuit's impact priced into the stock and turn their attention to the core business, which has strong AI prospects that many investors may be overlooking. The most bullish analyst is Phillip Securities Jonathan Woo, who issued a $240 price target in early November following the release of Google's third-quarter results. Woo is bullish on Alphabet's efforts to improve cost efficiencies and the higher profitability being exhibited by Google's cloud business. Woo also thinks Google has the ability to \"deliver almost instant ROI [return on investment] on its AI investments.\"\n\nWhile Woo's report may feel a little dated, other analysts are also upping their price targets. Wolfe Research recently issued a $230 price target on Alphabet as part of a bullish outlook for internet stocks. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt recently raised his price target to $220, citing the positive outlook for the cloud business, possible margin expansion, and the company's ability to grow its AI offerings.\n\nWhile not a legal expert, I also find it unlikely that a judge will rule for Google to sell Chrome or make some monumental change to the company. There are several other less drastic changes the court can impose to make Google less monopolistic. Google has been on the cutting edge of technology since the late 1990s, and I expect the company will remain cutting-edge with AI for years as well.\n\nWhile I agree with those investors who think the Magnificent Seven stocks are all vulnerable to a pullback right now, I will also say that, if you are going to buy one, Google looks appealing thanks to the fundamental strength of its core business and what was likely a short-term sell-off driven largely by the lawsuit.",

But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s still sung in the original tune!\n\nAnother difference includes not singing the \u2018and\u2019 at the end of the song right before the \u2018Z\u2019 as kids may confuse it for an \u2018N.\u2019\n\nPic: Shutterstock\n\nSpeech and language pathologist Carly Tulloch said of the update: \u2018This is so much better, the new version differentiates each letter name so children can more easily hear and understand the name of each letter. The old version blends them all together in one hard-to-understand chunk.\u2019\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced, a fellow primary school teacher, Jennifer Schutza says that there is no need for any changes to the song, insisting that slowing down the original has the same effect.\n\nPic: Shutterstock\n\nJennifer also added: \u2018Better yet, have kids look at the letters while singing so they not only learn with their ears but their eyes.\u2019\n\nWhether you will be using this updated version of the song or not, it\u2019s not a bad idea to keep it in the back of your mind in case your little one struggles to grasp the original.\n\nShare your thoughts on this story or any other over on our discussion boards.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best machine learning stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nEarlier this month, the president of Potomac Wealth Advisors, Mark Avallone, discussed the tech sector\u2019s investment potential. We talked about his sentiment in more detail in one of our other articles, 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy in 2025. Here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\n\u201cHe noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\u201d\n\nJust like Avallone, several analysts hold a positive outlook for tech stocks as we go into 2025. Daniel Ives, Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, thinks that the AI revolution is driving this strength in tech. On January 13, he appeared on CNBC and discussed the tech sector in light of rising interest rates and a strengthening dollar. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.75%, which is exerting pressure on tech stocks. Despite this, Ives expressed optimism about the sector\u2019s potential for growth and suggested that the current environment presents opportunities to invest in leading companies. He emphasized that capital expenditures are robust on the consumer side and indicate stronger-than-expected earnings ahead. Ives believes that we are only halfway through the bull market, which he views as a positive sign for tech stocks moving forward.\n\nIves discussed Palantir Technologies, which has faced selling pressure despite being a top S&P 500 performer last year. He warned that overlooking it due to high valuation could mean missing key market opportunities, similar to Oracle and Salesforce, especially with $2 trillion in expected AI capital expenditures. Ives also highlighted the impact of a rising dollar on tech, particularly Apple\u2019s vulnerability, while remaining bullish on the sector. He emphasized the need for diversification, citing Microsoft and NVIDIA as indicators for AI growth.\n\nHis optimism about the tech sector highlights opportunities as investors navigate this landscape.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a technology conglomerate and the parent company of Google. Its core businesses include search, advertising, cloud computing, and a diverse portfolio of \u201cOther Bets,\u201d such as self-driving cars and life sciences. It\u2019s known for its innovative culture and focus on AI.\n\nStifel recently raised its target to $225, predicting a 17% upside, due to the company\u2019s dominance in search, online video, and strong AI potential. Wells Fargo, while acknowledging its AI advancements, maintained an Equal-Weight rating with a $190 price target. This indicates a slight downside. Wells Fargo expressed concerns about the potential impact of AI on Google Search and predicted a decline in search revenue as AI agents become more prevalent. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares also declined 1.3% on Monday, following a broader market downturn in the tech sector.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Gemini AI model is deeply integrated into Google Search, which enhances user experience and expands search capabilities. Features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search allow users to ask more complex questions and interact with search in new ways. This increased user engagement drives more search queries, benefiting both users and advertisers. In Q3 2024, Google Services revenue increased 13%, driven by strong performance in Google Search and other advertising revenue, which grew 12%.\n\nHere\u2019s what Qualivian Investment Partners said regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter, highlighting the company\u2019s strong second-quarter results:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet\u2019s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Management continued to highlight developments with their generative AI program, which is seen as a foundational platform with opportunities across their businesses but particularly in search and cloud. However, this comes with material capex investment well ahead of the expected economic benefits from Gen AI, and the level of spending is leading investors to worry about the ROI on that spend for Alphabet, as well as the other hyperscalers (Microsoft and Amazon). We continue to have confidence in Alphabet\u2019s ability to generate strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth well above the S&P 500\u2019s in the years to come and view it as a core holding for the long term.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of best machine learning stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) presents The Lost Alphabet by Ahmet G\u00fcne\u015ftekin. Weaving the artist\u2019s works across diverse mediums, the exhibition focuses on affective associations of sculptural materials combined with objects in narrative constellations that bridge ancient mythologies with the changing environment of contemporary life. Curated by Christoph Tannert, the exhibition features sculptures, installations, videos, sound works, ceramics, and fabrics blending macro and micro scales through meticulous material interventions.\n\nGiven rise to fluid mythological worlds, the artist\u2019s practice encompasses installations whose bodily presence transforms a visual perception \u2013 a face-to-face experience \u2013 into a fully haptic, subjective encounter; filmic and sound practices in which he develops micro-rhythmic structures that challenge the field of the historical narrative; dimensional works that expand his interpretations into meta-myths with multi-faceted figures seamlessly inhabiting canvas, textiles and ceramics; hybrid works mostly affected by migration objects, their volume in space, and the memories they evoke; and sculptures made of stone and metal fragments combined syncretically, coalescing the movement and immobility in a dialectical pairing of creation and destruction.\n\nThe Lost Alphabet aims to open up a dialogue with materiality that evolves into a polyphonic conversation. It confronts the viewer with time-space pieces broken off from the whole and seeks answers: Why does an object become the subject of inquiry? Why do some objects return as the focus of research again and again? The artist explores everyday fragments mostly shaped by mundane yet evocative objects, light and shadow, humans and objects cast on each other, their volume in space, memories and stories they trigger, imbued with an aesthetic inspired by ruins and present-tense relics. In the artist\u2019s world, all objects circularly emerge in ruins; shoes, signposts, suitcases, gas masks, scarves, fridges, bicycles and all other non-human actors are the material remnants of the past.\n\nThe realm of language is the artist\u2019s sphere of practice in the works as a tribute to the banned fictional, imaginary universes and thoughts, extinct languages due to human intervention, and vulnerable and endangered languages. He superimposes graphemes (letters) onto phonemes (sounds) in the works with the letterforms. Relying on the notion that language is a complex living system, he investigates the complex issue of alphabet politics \u2014 the attempts by nations, cultures, and ideologies to ascribe a specific set of letters to a given language. The artist suggests that the alphabets are not just forms of language, they encompass cultures and voices they blossomed from.\n\nG\u00fcne\u015ftekin\u2019s sensibilities about lost alphabets coalesce with his treatment of diverse materials. The artist\u2019s explorations of stone blossom into a series of works, which incorporate sound, images, and objects in a fusion that reflects different facets of the materials specific to the exhibition\u2019s sculptural space. Studying the ancient coins of Anatolia from the last three thousand years, in the section titled Witnesses Through Thousands of Years, co-curated by Hasan Mert Kaya, through metafictional constructs and affective associations, he deconstructs different dimensions of mythology to disclose the multi-layered aspect of everyday life and the multiple truths to which it gives birth.\n\nFrom his sculptures with stone formations, some with fossilised structures, to his installations with objects, his site-specific works create a dialogue with a particular setting. They are interwoven in a way that intensifies viewers\u2019 perceptions. The sculptures featuring marble stone formations enclosed within intertwining circular metal carcasses with differing sizes and layouts and carved through labyrinthine pathways showcase the artist\u2019s scale change and connect the installation space to Feshane\u2019s industrial history.\n\nThe Lost Alphabet is a cultural project introduced to the Istanbul art scene in the city\u2019s cultural hub, extensively restored by IMM Heritage, preserving the historic Feshane-i Amire. Under the artistic direction of Angelo Bucarelli and Paola Marino, the exhibition combines works of the artist\u2019s sublime spheres, whose quest is as metaphysical as tangibly formal and spurs thoughts and forms through overlapping spaces and objects.",

It corresponds to Semitic koph, which may derive from an earlier sign representing the eye of a needle, and to Greek koppa. The form of the majuscule has been practically identical throughout its known history.\n\nIn the form found on the Moabite stone, the vertical stroke extended to the top of the loop, and the same is the case with an early form from the island of Thera. The Etruscan form was identical with the Greek. The Latin alphabet had two forms, the latter of which resembled the modern Q.\n\nIn the minuscule form the stroke was moved to the right side of the letter because of the speed of writing. This produced a cursive form similar to the modern q in the 6th century ce. Uncial writing also had a form similar to q, and the Carolingian form was practically identical. In Semitic the sound represented by the letter was an unvoiced guttural pronounced farther back than that represented by the letter kaph. In Greek the letter was largely redundant, and in the eastern alphabet it was entirely superseded by kappa (\u039a).\n\nIn the Chalcidian alphabet, however, it lingered and spread from there, probably through the Etruscan, into the Latin alphabet, where it was used only with a following u, the combination representing the unvoiced labiovelar sound in such words as quaestor. The combination of these two letters holds to the present day, and in modern English q is not used unless followed by u, even if, in words such as oblique, the sound is a simple velar and not a labiovelar. The most usual position of the sound is initial in words such as queen and quick. The letter is used apart from u only rarely in words of foreign origin, especially to represent a Semitic guttural, as in Qatar or Iraq.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA, Uber Technologies UBER and NVIDIA NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nRobotaxi Ride-Hailing Rivalry Intensifies: Uber/NVIDIA Pact vs. Tesla\n\nThe autonomous ride-sharing industry is heating up, despite legacy U.S. automakers like Ford and General Motors waving the white flag in their robotaxi ambitions. Ford exited the race in 2022, selling its stake in Argo.AI, and General Motors followed suit in 2024 after investing $10 billion in Cruise, which faced regulatory roadblocks and safety concerns.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet\u2019s Waymo is the clear leader in the U.S. robotaxi space. Waymo has achieved significant milestones in the industry. Its commercial robotaxi services already operate in major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile, EV giant Tesla and Amazon-backed Zoox remain in the spotlight as key contenders. However, a recent partnership between Uber Technologies and NVIDIA has shaken up the landscape, positioning Uber as a formidable rival to Tesla in the robotaxi market.\n\nWhile UBER\u2019s approach is very different from Tesla's, the companies are eyeing a huge market. Statista projects autonomous ride-hailing to be a $5 trillion market by 2030. As companies race to innovate, 2025 promises to be a pivotal year in the robotaxi revolution.\n\nUber-NVIDIA Collaboration: Revolutionizing Autonomous Driving\n\nUber\u2019s partnership with NVIDIA (announced last week) is set to accelerate the development of autonomous driving solutions. By leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge AI platforms\u2014Cosmos and DGX Cloud\u2014and Uber\u2019s vast repository of ride data, the partnership aims to create scalable and efficient AV models. This alliance could redefine the competitive dynamics in the robotaxi market, challenging Tesla\u2019s dominance.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Cosmos platform, unveiled at CES 2025, is a breakthrough in synthetic data generation, enabling the simulation of photorealistic, physics-based driving scenarios. This capability is critical for training and evaluating AV systems, reducing reliance on costly real-world testing. Complementing this is the DGX Cloud, a high-performance AI platform that provides the computational power needed to develop complex AV models at scale. Together, these technologies position Uber to fast-track its autonomous driving ambitions.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros\u2019 portfolio.\n\nThe Man Who Broke the Bank of England\n\nWhen it comes to financial lore, you\u2019d struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros. With a net worth of $7.2 billion, Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends, which has led to millions, if not billions, of dollars in strategic savings or profits. He cemented his reputation in financial legend, for instance, when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with $1 billion profit in a single day. Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund, which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30%.\n\nHaving founded his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, back in the 1970s, Soros\u2019 investment philosophy is centered around his concept of \u201creflexivity\u201d. Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves, causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations. The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns. The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles. According to Soros, \u201cWhen I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire\u201d. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean one can always hit the bullseye; we saw this during the dot-com era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses.\n\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s 13F portfolio contained $6.92 billion in securities as of September 30, up from $5.56 billion a quarter earlier. About 9.8% and 7.4% of those securities were in the technology and services sectors, respectively, down from 11.7% and 10.6% from the quarter prior. Healthcare, basic materials, and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the fund\u2019s portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSoros\u2019 Opposition to AI\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence. Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat, especially to what he calls \u201copen societies\u201d, simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance, but it can also be liable in its misuse. In Soros\u2019 ideal world, AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable, though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe. In a MarketWatch article from 2023, Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology. Here\u2019s what he wrote:\n\n\u201cWe, human beings, are both participants and observers in the world in which we live. As participants we want to change the world in our favor; as observers we want to understand reality as it is. These two objectives interfere with each other. I regard this as an important insight which allows me to distinguish between right and wrong. AI destroyed this simple schema because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. AI creates its own reality and when that artificial reality fails to correspond to the real world \u2013which happens quite often \u2014 it is discarded as hallucination. This made me almost instinctively opposed to AI and I wholeheartedly agree with the experts who argue that it needs to be regulated. But AI regulations have to be globally enforceable, because the incentive to cheat is too great; those who evade the regulations gain an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q3 portfolio and chose its top 10 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund\u2019s stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s stake as of Q3: $86.5 million\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a leading tech giant with a diverse portfolio, including Google Services, Google Cloud, and other services. The company offers products such as Google ads, Google Chrome, Search, and YouTube, holding a dominant position in each of these markets.\n\nUBS maintained its Neutral rating on GOOGL shares with a price target of $192 back in November. The firm pointed out the DOJ\u2019s Initial Proposed Final Judgment, which suggested remedies in the wake of a court order that designated Google as a monopoly in the search sector. UBS said the proposed constraints are consistent with past DOJ rules from August and October, which may pose long-term revenue threats to the company. That said, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) plans to appeal the ruling and seeks an injunction.\n\nFor Q3 2024, GOOGL reported a 15% year-over-year increase in consolidated revenue, reaching $88.3 billion. One of the primary drivers of this growth was the Cloud segment, with revenue surging from 35% year-over-year. This was led primarily by AI infrastructure and GenAI solutions within the Cloud Platform services.\n\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund (Hedged) stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating performance remains strong with sales growing 14% in the most recent quarter. Highlights included the ongoing secular growth of digital advertising driving Google search (+14%), YouTube\u2019s continued success as a leading content platform (+13%) and the performance of the Cloud business (+29%). In conjunction with this strong sales momentum, Alphabet\u2019s increased focus on expenses is delivering margin expansion such that Operating Income grew 26%.\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 7th on our list of top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros\u2019 portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "American stock exchanges are home to nine technology companies with valuations of $1 trillion or more, but only three have graduated into the $3 trillion club so far:\n\nApple: $3.56 trillion\n\n$3.56 trillion Nvidia: $3.34 trillion\n\n$3.34 trillion Microsoft: $3.11 trillion\n\nAlphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) is the world's fourth-largest company, with a market capitalization of $2.36 trillion as of this writing. Its stock soared by more than 35% during 2024, and it's currently trading near a record high.\n\nAlphabet has become a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and it's embedding the technology across many of its legacy businesses, including Google Search. Let's explore why this tech giant has a clear path to joining the exclusive $3 trillion club in 2025.\n\nAI could transform Google Search\n\nWhen OpenAI's ChatGPT application went mainstream in 2023, it offered an entirely new way to access information online. Alphabet investors were concerned because Google Search is the conglomerate's primary source of revenue, and its 90% market share in the internet search industry was suddenly under threat.\n\nAlphabet launched a decisive response, which culminated in a family of its own AI models called Gemini (with a chatbot of the same name). The company also overhauled the traditional Google Search experience by presenting AI-generated answers to queries that appear above the usual results. This feature saves users from sifting through web pages to find the information they need.\n\nAlphabet also went a step further recently when it launched AI Overviews for Google Search. They incorporate text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide more complete answers to users' queries. The company discovered that links within Overviews receive more clicks than had they appeared in traditional search results, so this new format could drive significant revenue as it gathers momentum.\n\nOverviews recently rolled out to more than 100 new countries where they will reach 1 billion users every month, and they might be the secret to protecting Google's dominant market share in the search industry.\n\nGoogle Cloud is growing rapidly, thanks to AI\n\nThe advertising dollars generated by Google Search accounted for $49.3 billion of Alphabet's $88.2 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30). Google Cloud, on the other hand, contributed just $11.3 billion. However, that figure represented growth of 34.9% compared to the year-ago period, whereas the search business generated growth of just 12.2%.\n\nQ3 also marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which Google Cloud's revenue growth accelerated, and AI was a big part of the reason. The platform is a go-to destination for developers seeking the tools to build AI software, whether it's data center computing infrastructure or ready-made large language models (LLMs) like Gemini.\n\nGoogle Cloud operates several data centers filled with Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processors (GPUs), which are the most popular chips for AI workloads. However, Google also designed its own chips like the Trillium tensor processing unit. Offering a mix of hardware helps Google Cloud differentiate itself from the competition, but designing chips in-house also unlocks a level of customization that can reduce costs and drive efficiency.\n\nOn the software side, businesses can access more than 130 ready-made LLMs through Google Cloud, which they can use to accelerate the development of AI applications. In a series of prepared remarks for Q3, Alphabet said the usage of Gemini alone soared by 14 times over the prior six-month period.\n\nAlphabet has a mathematical path to the $3 trillion club\n\nAlphabet generated $7.54 in trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.7. As you can see in the chart below, its stock trades significantly cheaper than each of the $3 trillion giants I mentioned at the top, which trade at an average P/E ratio of 43.3.\n\nThere are two ways Alphabet could join the $3 trillion club in 2025: multiple expansion (a higher P/E ratio) or good old-fashioned earnings growth.\n\nIf Alphabet's P/E ratio rises to the other three's average (43.3), it would translate to a 68% increase in its stock price from where it currently trades. That alone would make it a $4 trillion company, without any additional earnings growth! Even if Alphabet's P/E ratio rose to 35 (equivalent to Microsoft, the cheapest $3 trillion stock), its market cap would jump to $3.2 trillion.\n\nBut what if its P/E ratio remained the same, and the company relied on earnings growth alone?\n\nWall Street's consensus forecast (provided by Yahoo Finance) suggests Alphabet will generate $8.99 in EPS this year, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 21.6. It implies the stock will have to climb by 19% before the end of the year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 25.7, which would be enough to lift its market cap to $2.85 trillion. So it still needs some multiple expansion.\n\nWhy is Alphabet's P/E ratio so low?\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Alphabet for engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The lawsuit referenced the large payments Alphabet makes every year to partners including Apple in exchange for making Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone. In August 2024, the judge ruled in the DOJ's favor, which left Alphabet in an uncertain position.\n\nThe court won't define Alphabet's punishment until later this year. It could impose a financial penalty, which would be a positive for shareholders, or it could force the company to stop paying partners like Apple, which would erode Google's market share. The DOJ actually wants Alphabet to sell its Chrome internet browser (which uses Google by default) to help restore some competitiveness to the search industry.\n\nIf any of the more severe remedies are imposed, this case could be tied up in the courts for years as Alphabet appeals the decision. However, the DOJ is likely to be overhauled once the Trump administration takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump is expected to bring a business-friendly policy agenda to the White House, which includes significant deregulation. He even made some specific comments on the campaign trail last year that suggested he doesn't want to see Alphabet's business broken up. Personally, I think the odds of a financial settlement are now extremely high, which will be a massive win for the company.\n\nIf the Trump administration pulls Alphabet out of the regulatory fire, its P/E ratio is likely to jump several points as investors cheer the removal of a significant risk. Combined with the company's projected earnings growth, I think it has a great shot at joining the $3 trillion club in 2025.",

Its stock soared by more than 35% during 2024, and it's currently trading near a record high.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nAlphabet has become a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and it's embedding the technology across many of its legacy businesses, including Google Search. Let's explore why this tech giant has a clear path to joining the exclusive $3 trillion club in 2025.\n\nAn image of Google's office headquarters.\n\nImage source: Alphabet.\n\nAI could transform Google Search\n\nWhen OpenAI's ChatGPT application went mainstream in 2023, it offered an entirely new way to access information online. Alphabet investors were concerned because Google Search is the conglomerate's primary source of revenue, and its 90% market share in the internet search industry was suddenly under threat.\n\nAlphabet launched a decisive response, which culminated in a family of its own AI models called Gemini (with a chatbot of the same name). The company also overhauled the traditional Google Search experience by presenting AI-generated answers to queries that appear above the usual results. This feature saves users from sifting through web pages to find the information they need.\n\nAlphabet also went a step further recently when it launched AI Overviews for Google Search. They incorporate text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide more complete answers to users' queries. The company discovered that links within Overviews receive more clicks than had they appeared in traditional search results, so this new format could drive significant revenue as it gathers momentum.\n\nOverviews recently rolled out to more than 100 new countries where they will reach 1 billion users every month, and they might be the secret to protecting Google's dominant market share in the search industry.\n\nGoogle Cloud is growing rapidly, thanks to AI\n\nThe advertising dollars generated by Google Search accounted for $49.3 billion of Alphabet's $88.2 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30). Google Cloud, on the other hand, contributed just $11.3 billion. However, that figure represented growth of 34.9% compared to the year-ago period, whereas the search business generated growth of just 12.2%.\n\nQ3 also marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which Google Cloud's revenue growth accelerated, and AI was a big part of the reason. The platform is a go-to destination for developers seeking the tools to build AI software, whether it's data center computing infrastructure or ready-made large language models (LLMs) like Gemini.\n\nGoogle Cloud operates several data centers filled with Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processors (GPUs), which are the most popular chips for AI workloads. However, Google also designed its own chips like the Trillium tensor processing unit. Offering a mix of hardware helps Google Cloud differentiate itself from the competition, but designing chips in-house also unlocks a level of customization that can reduce costs and drive efficiency.\n\nOn the software side, businesses can access more than 130 ready-made LLMs through Google Cloud, which they can use to accelerate the development of AI applications. In a series of prepared remarks for Q3, Alphabet said the usage of Gemini alone soared by 14 times over the prior six-month period.\n\nAlphabet has a mathematical path to the $3 trillion club\n\nAlphabet generated $7.54 in trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.7. As you can see in the chart below, its stock trades significantly cheaper than each of the $3 trillion giants I mentioned at the top.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nThere are two ways Alphabet could join the $3 trillion club in 2025: multiple expansion (a higher P/E ratio) or good old-fashioned earnings growth.\n\nIf Alphabet's P/E ratio rises to 43.3, it would translate to a 68% increase in its stock price from where it currently trades. That alone would make it a $4 trillion company, without any additional earnings growth! Even if Alphabet's P/E ratio rose to 35 (equivalent to Microsoft, the cheapest $3 trillion stock), its market cap would jump to $3.2 trillion.\n\nBut what if its P/E ratio remained the same, and the company relied on earnings growth alone?\n\nWall Street's consensus forecast (provided by Yahoo Finance) suggests Alphabet will generate $8.99 in EPS this year, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 21.6. It implies the stock will have to climb by 19% before the end of the year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 25.7, which would be enough to lift its market cap to $2.85 trillion. So it still needs some multiple expansion.\n\nWhy is Alphabet's P/E ratio so low?\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Alphabet for engaging in anticompetitive behavior. The lawsuit referenced the large payments Alphabet makes every year to partners including Apple in exchange for making Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone. In August 2024, the judge ruled in the DOJ's favor, which left Alphabet in an uncertain position.\n\nThe court won't define Alphabet's punishment until later this year. It could impose a financial penalty, which would be a positive for shareholders, or it could force the company to stop paying partners like Apple, which would erode Google's market share. The DOJ actually wants Alphabet to sell its Chrome internet browser (which uses Google by default) to help restore some competitiveness to the search industry.\n\nIf any of the more severe remedies are imposed, this case could be tied up in the courts for years as Alphabet appeals the decision. However, the DOJ is likely to be overhauled once the Trump administration takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump is expected to bring a business-friendly policy agenda to the White House, which includes significant deregulation. He even made some specific comments on the campaign trail last year that suggested he doesn't want to see Alphabet's business broken up. Personally, I think the odds of a financial settlement are now extremely high, which will be a massive win for the company.\n\nIf the Trump administration pulls Alphabet out of the regulatory fire, its P/E ratio is likely to jump several points as investors cheer the removal of a significant risk. Combined with the company's projected earnings growth, I think it has a great shot at joining the $3 trillion club in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nAs 2025 began, King Lip, chief strategist and partner at BakerAvenue Wealth Management expressed his bullish outlook for tech stocks in 2025 during a CNBC interview. He underscored a strong belief in the continued outperformance of tech stocks in 2025, driven by robust earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from our article on the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term that covered this:\n\n\u201c\u2026Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the high valuations of many tech stocks, he argued that they remain within acceptable historical norms. On January 9, Mark Avallone, president at Potomac Wealth Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to discuss why technology is the best sector to invest in right now. He asserts that above-target inflation will prevent the Fed from implementing further easing measures, countering the notion that higher rates are detrimental. He noted that market rates have surged to all-time highs, with a significant increase of 1,800 points since October 2023. Avallone emphasizes that tech stocks, particularly cash-flowing mega-cap and large-cap companies, have shown resilience against rising rates, attributing this to improved operational efficiencies and ongoing technology spending even in a slowing economy.\n\nAvallone highlighted recent deal chatter in the tech sector, including Shutter Stock\u2019s potential acquisition in the uniform space, reflecting growing interest in technology-driven solutions. He is optimistic about the incoming administration\u2019s impact on economic efficiencies and stock performance, particularly for large-cap tech firms and mid-cap companies focused on innovation. He views Hilton favorably for its technological advancements in office management and cost efficiency. In the defense sector, he expressed confidence in Boeing\u2019s growth potential, emphasizing that significant cuts to defense spending are unlikely and that advancements in tech will enhance military capabilities.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top 20 NASDAQ for 2025. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a technology conglomerate with a diverse portfolio of businesses, including Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. In Q3 2024, the company demonstrated an increased demand for its search and cloud services, due to the advancements in AI.\n\nGoogle Search maintains a 90% global market share and generated ~74% of the company\u2019s total revenue in Q3 2024. Its ongoing investments in AI, which can be highlighted by the Gemini models integrated across its products, position it for long-term growth. By the third quarter, all products with over 2 billion monthly users utilized Gemini models.\n\nThe CEO Sundar Pichai noted that AI solutions are enhancing product adoption among existing customers, attracting new clients, and securing larger contracts. He outlined plans to accelerate AI product launches in 2025 and emphasized the potential of the Gemini AI model to reach 500 million users. Gemini 2.0 Flash is now widely available to developers. With AI expected to drive a projected $200 billion market by 2026, the company\u2019s focus on AI innovation solidifies its competitive edge.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ronald Josey has a Buy rating and a $232 price target on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Google is facing legal challenges from the government over its dominance in online search. While Google disagrees with the court\u2019s decision and plans to appeal, it has proposed a solution to address the concerns. Investments in new technologies, such as Gemini 2, showcase that the company is still focused on innovating and improving its products.\n\nHere\u2019s what Qualivian Investment Partners said regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter, highlighting the company\u2019s strong second-quarter results:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet\u2019s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Management continued to highlight developments with their generative AI program, which is seen as a foundational platform with opportunities across their businesses but particularly in search and cloud. However, this comes with material capex investment well ahead of the expected economic benefits from Gen AI, and the level of spending is leading investors to worry about the ROI on that spend for Alphabet, as well as the other hyperscalers (Microsoft and Amazon). We continue to have confidence in Alphabet\u2019s ability to generate strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth well above the S&P 500\u2019s in the years to come and view it as a core holding for the long term.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) surged 35.5% in 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Alphabet entered 2024 under a cloud of skepticism regarding its competitiveness in the artificial intelligence (AI) races and amid pressure from antitrust authorities.\n\nWhile those headwinds didn't go away -- they actually intensified -- Alphabet executed impressively against them, both technologically and financially. These positives outweighed the negatives, leading to a strong year of gains.\n\nA rocky start got better as Alphabet got to work\n\nAlphabet has a number of segments, but all are fairly dependent on AI technology. Given the rapid rise in AI competition from incumbents and start-ups alike, Alphabet entered 2024 besieged on all fronts. Yet, the company executed impressively against these challenges.\n\nFor instance, in February, Alphabet's Imagen 2 image generator, powered by Alphabet's Gemini large language model (LLM), came under criticism after users produced people of color in German uniforms when asking Imagen to create a picture of Nazi soldiers. Yet, when Imagen 3 was rolled out about six months later, toward the end of the year, the updated image generator drew rave reviews.\n\nThis was just one example of Alphabet overcoming technology hurdles to regain industry-leading status on par with OpenAI and others. This culminated in December with the rollout of Gemini 2.0, Google's upgraded family of LLMs, which also drew a positive reception from technologists.\n\nWhile Gemini is probably the most important update to get right, Alphabet also showed impressive innovation in its more future-looking ventures. In December, the company unveiled Willow, a quantum computing chip that management said completed a calculation in five minutes that traditional computing technology couldn't complete in the time the entire universe has existed!\n\nAlphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, also showed progress. In 2024, it seemingly hit escape velocity after years of being perceived as a money-losing science experiment. Waymo delivered over four million rides in 2024, building on the mere 1 million it had completed coming into the year.\n\nIn June, Waymo expanded its San Francisco service, first piloted in 2023, to the entire city and surrounding area. In April, Waymo launched citywide service in Los Angeles. Waymo also announced it will expand to Austin and Atlanta in 2025 and Miami in 2026.\n\nReassuming technology leadership across AI applications is crucial for Alphabet, but what was really impressive was that the company delivered this innovation in conjunction with strong growth and margin expansion.\n\nWhile investors feared AI might threaten Google's search franchise, Search actually grew a solid 13.4% through the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, Google Cloud accelerated its growth by 30.9% over that time, delivering impressive numbers against its larger competitors. Meanwhile, operating margins for the overall company expanded from 27.4% to 32.1% over the first nine months.\n\nGiven that Alphabet came into the year trading at a lower multiple than the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, its excellent financial results propelled it to strong gains.\n\nThe government is also weighing on Alphabet's business\n\nOne issue to monitor, which may put a cap on Alphabet's valuation near term, is the antitrust headwinds Alphabet continues to face. In August, a federal judge ruled Alphabet held an illegal monopoly in the search market. Meanwhile, another Department of Justice case accuses Alphabet of having an illegal dominance of online ad technology, generally, with that trial awaiting a ruling.\n\nStill, Alphabet plans to appeal the August ruling, and one Wall Street analyst recently suggested the new administration, perceived as pro-business, may encourage a less-onerous punishment or remedy for Alphabet.\n\nDespite the regulatory overhang, 2024 was an encouraging year for Alphabet as it countered several competitive threats while still delivering strong profit growth for shareholders. Look for Alphabet to remain a formidable player in the AI era, which, at this point, looks to be more of a tailwind than a threat.",

In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.8%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nNasdaqGS:GOOGL Return on Capital Employed January 12th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Alphabet's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\n\nSo How Is Alphabet's ROCE Trending?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Alphabet. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 31%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 56%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Alphabet can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other latest AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAnastasia Amoroso, iCapital chief investment officer, said in a latest program on CNBC that 2025 will be the year of AI software, data centers and power. She believes the AI rally is broadening out.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence, as I mentioned, is carrying itself over into 2025, and I think it\u2019s broadening. Last year, last two years, have been about semiconductors. I think this year has to be about AI software; it has to be about AI monetization, but it also has to be about AI power. And it\u2019s not just, you know, a number of headlines talking about data centers and how much they consume, and the fact that I think you need eight times the electricity to run an AI data center. It\u2019s an actual real trend, which I also think the Trump Administration is going to support as well.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also said investors should consider alternative investments or private markets as she believes private equity valuations are below the levels seen in public markets.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 160\n\nMichael Khouw, Co-Founder and Chief Strategist of OpenInterest.PRO, said in a latest program on CNBC that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is undervalued.\n\n\u201cAlphabet deserves a market multiple more than the market does at 25 times. That would be 20% upside from here. I like Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG),\u201d he said.\n\nThe market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google\u2019s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader.\n\nWhat are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August.\n\nThis growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day\u2014substantially higher than Uber\u2019s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber\u2019s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo\u2019s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing.\n\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit\u2014a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment\u2019s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): Google was our top detractor in the third quarter despite reporting second quarter results that were generally in line with expectations. The company reported slightly better revenue growth in Search, which grew 14% and continues to be resilient in the face of AI challengers, and Google Cloud, which grew 29% in the quarter. Service operating income margins of 40% and Cloud operating income margins of 11% were also both ahead of investors\u2019 expectations as management\u2019s cost-efficiency efforts drove operating leverage. YouTube revenue growth was slightly below expectations (+13% v. +16%) driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons and some general weakness in the Brand Advertising vertical. Finally, Cap Ex in the quarter of $13.2 billion was more than expected and likely the driver of the weakness in the stock as investors grapple with how much infrastructure investment will be required to achieve Google\u2019s AI goals. With its high margin business model (44% EBITDA margins last quarter), continued strength across its core Search and YouTube franchises, and continued growth and expanding profitability in its still relatively small Cloud business, we continue to view Alphabet as among the best-positioned secular growth franchises in the market. Additionally, GOOG shares trade at a compelling 19.5x the Street\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate, a discount to the Russell 1000 Growth Index.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the latest AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

From unhoused Angelenos to beachfront millionaires, thousands of people lost homes, possessions and memories.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The weather on the morning of Jan. 7 felt different to Neal Flesner. He had lived in Los Angeles for some 25 years and had never before experienced such intense, dust-filled winds.\n\nBy the time Flesner left the gym in Venice Beach around 11 a.m. local time, he could already see smoke and flames filling the hills near his Pacific Palisades, California, home.\n\nHis wife, Carmen, whose family had lived in Los Angeles for generations, was already beginning to prepare for an evacuation. The couple had lived in the Mandeville Canyon area near the Palisades for years and had experienced at least a half-dozen wildfire evacuations, Flesner admitted.\n\nBut in the Alphabet Streets area of the Palisades where they lived, Flesner said there was always a feeling that they were far enough away from rural areas with the dry brush. That they were safe from the fires.\n\n\u201cIt was life. The probability of fire was always high,\u201d Flesner said.\n\n'We put all our effort and building that home'\n\nWhen Flesner returned to his home, roughly 24 hours after fleeing, he learned that wasn\u2019t the case. As the Palisades fire raged, gobbling up huge swaths of land, Flesner, 48, decided to hike four and a half miles back into the area from Santa Monica with a man he had just met on the street.\n\nHe said he was propelled by a \"burning desire\" to see firsthand the damage the blaze had wrought to his and Carmen\u2019s \"happy place.\"\n\n\"That was where we lived. That's where we wanted to live for the rest of our lives. That's where we put all our effort and building that home,\" Flesner said. \"And I need to see that firsthand.\"\n\nFlesner found the entire Alphabet Streets neighborhood reduced to rubble. The only structure still standing, almost untouched, was his garage.\n\nInside was all that was left of his and his wife\u2019s life. A few bottles of wine, some family photos, and a prized fountainhead that had belonged to his wife\u2019s father, who passed away more than a decade ago.\n\nNew financial reality: From unhoused folks to beachfront Malibu homeowners, wildfires hit all of LA society\n\n'It's helpful to have some support'\n\nPalisades and Malibu, California, residents waited at intersections along the Pacific Coast Highway, such as Temescal Canyon and Channel Road, on Saturday for the opportunity to receive a police escort into the Palisades Fire burn zone.\n\nJoel Kleinman, 51, waited 15 minutes for a ride to his family home in the Alphabet Streets neighborhood. He was overcome with emotion when he saw his house destroyed by the fire.\n\nHis police escort, an officer with the Los Angeles Port, offered a sympathetic arm. Kleinman couldn\u2019t salvage much from his home but did find that his vehicle, which had melted headlights, was still drivable.\n\n\"It\u2019s obviously still fairly chaotic, dangerous environment, so it\u2019s helpful to have some support,\" Kleinman said. \"Even emotionally supportive.\"\n\nOthers have already begun talking about rebuilding.\n\n\"It was like small town USA, like Main Street USA in Big City, Los Angeles,\" Flesner said about Palisades. \"I want to be part of the effort to just not rebuild the homes, but rebuild the community, rebuild the culture, rebuild the life that we all shared and loved there.\"\n\n\u201cIt's a special place,\u201d he added. \u201cI think everyone wants to come back.\u201d",

As it enters 2025, the company is well-positioned to leverage its e-commerce platform for market share growth and harness artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its cloud services.\n\n\n\n\n\nE-commerce: Expanding Market Share\n\n\n\nAmazon has consistently gained market share in e-commerce, with eMarketer estimating that it surpassed 40% of total U.S. e-commerce sales in 2024. While competition from smaller online retailers surged during the pandemic, Amazon has improved its logistics and distribution networks to reinforce its leading position.\n\n\n\nThe company recently transitioned from a national to a regional warehouse system, a strategic move that optimizes delivery efficiency. Unlike traditional retailers such as Walmart and Costco, which utilize their physical stores for distribution, Amazon focuses on providing fast and affordable delivery options. By continuously improving delivery speed and expanding product offerings, Amazon aims to retain its Prime customers for a wider range of needs.\n\n\n\nSame-day delivery orders have surged by 25% year-over-year, and new warehouse models incorporating robotics technology have reduced processing times by 25%, leading to significant cost savings. Looking ahead, Amazon is likely to capture an even larger share of the growing e-commerce market.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud Computing and AI: Accelerating Growth\n\n\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) holds a substantial 31% of the global cloud market, significantly ahead of second-place Microsoft Azure at 20%. With clients resuming spending after inflationary pressures, AWS is seeing increased interest, especially in generative AI applications.\n\n\n\nAWS has developed a robust AI offering, including tools for creating large language models and solutions for businesses of all sizes. In the third quarter, AWS sales growth accelerated to 19% year-over-year, and generative AI is already a billion-dollar revenue stream. CEO Andy Jassy views this opportunity as potentially transformative for the company\u2019s future.\n\n\n\nIn five years, AWS is expected to maintain its fast growth rate, contributing significantly to Amazon's operating income and improving profit margins.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreaming: Maintaining Competitiveness\n\n\n\nWhile Amazon may not be the first name that comes to mind in streaming, it remains competitive in the space, bolstered by its acquisition of MGM Studios and exclusive rights to high-profile content such as Thursday Night Football. The company\u2019s foray into ad-supported streaming, similar to its competitors, presents new revenue opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn five years, Amazon is likely to enhance its streaming service by expanding content offerings and further developing its advertising business, ensuring it remains a player in the competitive streaming landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising: A Fast-Growing Segment\n\n\n\nAmazon's advertising division has emerged as one of its fastest-growing operations. With access to hundreds of millions of Prime members, the company provides advertisers with powerful tools for targeting and engagement. The integration of AI into its advertising platform enhances its effectiveness, making it an attractive option for brands seeking to reach consumers.\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s ongoing investments and acquisitions in technology and healthcare, including a recent purchase of AI firm Anthropic, are expected to create additional growth avenues.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: What Lies Ahead for Amazon Stock\n\n\n\nAmazon stock outperformed the market in 2024 and is poised for continued growth in the coming years. While it has already generated significant wealth for investors, the company still has substantial growth potential. Although it may not exhibit the explosive growth of a startup, Amazon's lower risk profile combined with its market position suggests that it could reward investors handsomely over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering shares, indices, forex (foreign exchange) and commodities for trading and price predictions, remember that trading CFDs involves a significant degree of risk and could result in capital loss.\n\n\n\nPast performance is not indicative of any future results.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHistory indicates that the Nasdaq may soar again in 2025. Here is one artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy before it does.\n\nA misleading search narrative and AI opportunity\n\nNasdaq returns over the last two years have been propelled by the AI boom. A lot of stocks associated with AI, such as Nvidia, are now trading at nosebleed earnings multiples. However, one remains undervalued and is hiding in plain sight for investors to buy in 2025: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nThe owner of Google, YouTube, and other technology assets has been bogged down by a narrative that it is losing market share to new AI tools such as ChatGPT. It is true that ChatGPT gained a lot of popularity, but it hasn't come at the expense of Google Search's profitability. According to third-party estimates, Google Search still has an approximate 90% market share among search engines worldwide, which hasn't budged much in the last few years.\n\nGoogle is ingrained in the modern digital operating systems and has billions of daily users. Now, the company has an opportunity to supercharge the business with new AI products, such as its new search result summaries, the Gemini chatbot, and Google Lens (which allows you to search what you see). Google wants to allow you to search about anything in the world around you and get a thoughtful, AI-powered response behind it. This will open up more opportunities for search queries in day-to-day life, which will lead to more advertising revenue for the business.\n\nLast quarter, Google Search revenue grew 12% year over year to $49 billion.\n\nMultiple levers to keep earnings growing\n\nAlphabet has many levers it can pull to keep revenue and earnings growing. There's the aforementioned AI boom that will help grow Google Search. There's YouTube, which keeps gaining market share in video streaming and grew revenue by 12% last quarter. Google Cloud is helping Alphabet sell its AI breakthroughs to third parties and growing revenue by an astounding 35% year over year. At this pace, the segment will hit $100 billion in annual revenue in a few years.\n\nOn top of revenue growth, Alphabet is moving its bottom line by expanding its operating margin. Operating margin hit 32% last quarter, compared to 28% in the same period a year ago. With more scale, operating leverage will continue to kick in and help Alphabet grow its earnings power over the next few years.\n\nLastly, Alphabet is a consistent repurchaser of stock, with shares outstanding down 11% in the last five years. A shrinking share count helps grow earnings per share (EPS).\n\nGOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nGOOG PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nWhy Alphabet stock is a buy today\n\nThe five factors listed will help Alphabet compound its EPS at a double-digit rate over the next five years, and likely longer. And what do investors have to pay for this double-digit grower? At this writing, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26, which is below the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite averages of more than 30.\n\nThe AI boom will help Alphabet grow its EPS above the market average, while the stock trades at a P/E below the market average. This is a great situation to enter a position in Alphabet stock. Investors should buy this hypergrower and hold through 2025 and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Currently valued at $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is poised to benefit from the surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, predictions indicate that public cloud service companies might take the lead in the upcoming years.\n\nThe past two years have seen substantial investments in AI infrastructure, setting the stage for cloud giants like Amazon and Alphabet to potentially eclipse Nvidia\u2019s market value by 2025. Currently valued at $2.3 trillion, Amazon would require a 52% increase in its stock price to reach $3.5 trillion, while Alphabet, valued at $2.4 trillion, would need a 46% rise.\n\nAmazon\u2019s recent financial performance exceeded expectations, showcasing an 11% rise in revenue driven by robust cloud and advertising growth. Alongside, Amazon\u2019s aggressive investments in AI, including their custom AI chips, position it as a strong competitor in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet\u2019s financial results were equally impressive, with a 15% increase in revenue, primarily from Google Cloud. Its strategic focus on AI product development further strengthens its market position.\n\nWhile achieving these ambitious valuation targets may be challenging, both Amazon and Alphabet are positioned for long-term growth in the rapidly expanding AI landscape.\n\nUnveiling the AI Race: Who Will Dominate the Market?\n\nThe Current Landscape of AI and Market Valuation\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, with Nvidia playing a pivotal role in this transformation. Since the beginning of 2024, Nvidia\u2019s stock has soared by 180%, resulting in a market valuation of approximately $3.4 trillion. This meteoric rise is largely attributed to the increasing demand for AI technologies, which has reshaped market dynamics and drawn significant interest from investors.\n\nHowever, as the industry evolves, public cloud service providers, particularly Amazon and Alphabet, are poised to challenge Nvidia\u2019s supremacy. With current valuations of $2.3 trillion for Amazon and $2.4 trillion for Alphabet, both companies are exploring aggressive strategies to capture a larger share of the AI market.\n\nPredictions and Competitive Dynamics\n\nAccording to market analysts, it is plausible that by 2025, Amazon and Alphabet could surpass Nvidia in market value. Amazon would need to witness a 52% increase in its stock price, while Alphabet would require a 46% rise to attain valuations of $3.5 trillion and $3.45 trillion, respectively. This suggests that strong performance and strategic investments in AI technologies are crucial factors that could redefine the competitive landscape.\n\nAmazon: The Growing AI Contender\n\nAmazon\u2019s recent financial success illustrates its position as a formidable player in the AI arena. The company reported an 11% increase in revenue, thanks to substantial growth in its cloud services and advertising segments. Key to Amazon\u2019s strategy is its investment in developing custom AI chips, which are expected to enhance its cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Strong revenue growth in cloud and advertising sectors.\n\n\u2013 Significant investments in AI technology and infrastructure.\n\n\u2013 Development of custom AI chips to enhance competitive edge.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Requires further growth to meet ambitious valuation targets.\n\n\u2013 Intense competition from other tech giants.\n\nAlphabet: Strategic Focus on AI Development\n\nSimilarly, Alphabet has reported a notable 15% revenue increase, predominantly driven by Google Cloud. The company is heavily investing in AI product development, aiming to solidify its market position and innovate within the sector.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Consistent revenue growth, particularly in cloud services.\n\n\u2013 Strong commitment to AI development, offering advanced services and solutions.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Facing stiff competition from both established and emerging AI players.\n\n\u2013 Dependency on cloud market fluctuations.\n\nFuture Trends and Insights\n\nThe future of AI is not solely reliant on traditional companies but opens doors for startups and ventures focused on innovative AI applications. Market analysts predict that the AI industry will continue to expand, driven by advancements in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud computing. Moreover, the integration of AI into various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and transportation will further bolster demand.\n\nSecurity and Sustainability Considerations\n\nAs AI technology advances, the importance of security and ethical considerations becomes paramount. Companies must ensure robust cybersecurity measures to protect their data and systems from threats. Furthermore, sustainable practices in AI development will be critical, as energy consumption and resource management come under scrutiny.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the race for AI dominance is heating up, with Nvidia currently at the forefront.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other nuclear power and quantum computing stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently cautioned investors about the risks of speculating in sectors like nuclear power and quantum computing, suggesting it could take a long time before these fields generate meaningful returns. While Cramer acknowledged the optimism that accompanies the start of each new year, he pointed out that sometimes the enthusiasm surrounding certain industries is misplaced.\n\n\u201cThis year, I see two themes that I want to caution people about: nuclear power and quantum computing. Both have promise, someday, but that day is not, just not near enough to justify the current valuations for these stocks.\u201d\n\nHe clarified that while he does not view quantum computing as a hoax, he considers the current expectations surrounding the technology to be overly ambitious. The market, according to Cramer, is setting a low bar for progress in this area.\n\nREAD ALSO 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar and Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks\n\n\u201cLook, I believe in nuclear power, but when GE Vernova, the company that arguably has the most to gain from it, says discouraging things about an uptick in commercial nuclear power coming any time soon, when quantum computing seems very much in its infancy, well, I fear people will get hurt speculating on even the biggest companies, let alone the smaller ones.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for quantum computing became more uncertain last week when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that \"very useful\" quantum computers are at least a decade away. During a Q&A at Nvidia's Consumer Electronics Show Financial Analyst event, Huang suggested that 15 years might be an optimistic estimate, while 30 years could be more realistic. This timeline left little room for optimism among investors who had hoped for quicker breakthroughs.\n\nCramer acknowledged the speculative nature of these sectors but advised investors to be cautious and realistic about the potential for short-term gains.\n\n\u201cYou can speculate of course, but please understand that, like at all New Years, the animal spirits are in play for a few stocks and I don't want you to be trampled by wayward bulls with visions of riches in front of their greedy eyes. You own Rigetti?... Take some gains and then go out and buy yourself a nice cashmere sweater.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cloud computing stocks.\n\nCloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025.\n\nGartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends to Watch Out in 2025\n\nMoving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization.\n\nAI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks.\n\nFuture developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to. Next, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 10th January. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 9.3%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a significant player in the cloud computing space through its subsidiary, Google Cloud. The company\u2019s Al offerings are expected to differentiate its services from competitors, which should attract more enterprise customers and drive growth in this high-margin business. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to aggressively integrate Al capabilities into its core offerings, which should help enhance user experiences and maintain competitive edge. In Q3 2024, Google Cloud revenues rose 35% to $11.4 billion led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform across Al Infrastructure, Generative Al Solutions, and core GCP products.\n\nThe synergies between Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s cloud services and its other Al-powered products are expected to create a strong ecosystem for businesses, which should promote deeper integration and long-term customer relationships. This can result in increased customer retention and higher-value contracts, fueling revenue growth and margin expansion in its cloud segment. Several analysts remain optimistic about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s cloud business. For example, JPMorgan highlighted Google Cloud\u2019s accelerating growth due to greater GenAl demand primarily because of its Gemini large language model.\n\nAs per Matt Britzman, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s cloud business demonstrated strong performance in Q3 2024. The analyst further highlighted that the major cloud providers are well-positioned to benefit from the Al revolution. Reuters reported that the company\u2019s cloud business grew at the fastest pace in 8 quarters, courtesy of companies doubling down on cloud spending, which is critical to power Al technologies.\n\nQualivian Investment Partners, an investment partnership focused on long-only public equities, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat expectations, with total revenues growing 14%, Search ad revenues growing 14%, YouTube ads growing 13%, and Google Cloud revenues growing 29%. Revenue growth in the quarter constituted a continued sequential improvement from earlier quarters in the year, suggesting a continued rebound in Alphabet\u2019s core business except for YouTube ad revenues, which missed expectations and showed deceleration in the growth rate as compared to Q1 when it grew 21%. Operating margins improved by 310 bps vs. the same quarter last year. Management continued to highlight developments with their generative AI program, which is seen as a foundational platform with opportunities across their businesses but particularly in search and cloud. However, this comes with material capex investment well ahead of the expected economic benefits from Gen AI, and the level of spending is leading investors to worry about the ROI on that spend for Alphabet, as well as the other hyperscalers (Microsoft and Amazon). We continue to have confidence in Alphabet\u2019s ability to generate strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth well above the S&P 500\u2019s in the years to come and view it as a core holding for the long term.\u201d\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 11th on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Will they maintain their market dominance this year?\n\nHere's an analysis of their prospects for 2025:\n\nApple, a much-loved brand, reported robust sales in 2024, with its privacy features and ecosystem retaining customer loyalty. However, service growth fell short of expectations, and innovation in hardware seemed subdued.\n\nSusannah Streeter, Head of Money and Markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggests that the company's focus on AI could steer it in a new direction in 2025. Despite a five per cent cumulative revenue growth over the past three years, the consensus is for seven per cent growth in 2025, keeping expectations high.\n\nHowever, its stock has only risen 41 per cent over the past three years, underperforming the 51 per cent increase in the information technology index.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, cemented its place at the heart of the AI revolution in 2024, with Azure revenue up by 34 per cent, as per Streeter. The integration of AI tools like Copilot across its software suite has impressed analysts.\n\nIn the forthcoming year, cloud computing competition and increased regulatory scrutiny could challenge its growth trajectory, yet the discontinuation of Windows 10 support might trigger an upgrade cycle, according to Dan Niles, founder of AlphaOne Capital Partners. He recently expressed on LinkedIn that the termination of Windows 10 \"could also lead to some upgrades in their core PC business while a ramp in AI PC demand is a hope for some point in the future\".\n\nAmazon's Cloud AWS remained a key growth driver in 2024, with a 19 per cent revenue increase as global AI adoption soared. E-commerce margins saw a rebound following the company's cost-reduction strategies.\n\nStreeter noted, \"margins have recovered after the huge cost-saving drive with worldwide layoffs.\"\n\nAmazon may emerge as the top performer for 2025, having surpassed both revenue and margin expectations in the latest quarter. However, Nile pointed out the potential for a challenging start to 2025 due to uncertain consumer spending patterns, fewer shopping days, and less favourably timed holidays.\n\nFor Meta, the tech behemoth's strategic downsizing yielded positive results in 2024, evidenced by a five per cent increase in daily active users. Its investment in AI has improved ad targeting and content curation, bolstering advertiser trust.\n\nYet, the question remains whether Meta can maintain its growth momentum into 2025 without the previous year's tailwinds from political elections or major events like the Olympics, which had contributed to heightened user engagement.\n\n\"If its revenue doesn\u2019t keep up\", warned Streeter, \"margins may come under pressure, deterring its investors\". Alphabet, the parent company of Google, also posted strong results in 2024, driven by its cloud business and AI advancements.\n\nHowever, the ongoing case by the US Department of Justice against Google\u2019s search monopoly casts a shadow over the firm\u2019s 2025 outlook. Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive, highlighted the importance of utilising AI to accelerate progress and solve real-world problems.\n\nThe company made headlines towards the end of 2024, as Pichai prepared his employees for an important, \"pivotal\" year ahead, while also alerting them to potential challenges.\n\n(Image: Niall Carson/PA)\n\nTesla begins to lose momentum. Tesla experienced a surge of optimism in 2024, with its stock increasing by 63 per cent, partially due to Elon Musk\u2019s advisory role in the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, a decrease in EV demand and the potential loss of tax credits in 2025 could impact the company\u2019s sales. Therefore, Tesla's ability to scale production of its affordable electric vehicles and expand self-driving capabilities will be crucial for 2025.\n\nNvidia was largely the leader of the Magnificent Seven group in 2024, overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable company with its shares rising by 171 per cent amid surging AI demand. Despite taking a slight hit at the end of 2024, according to Investopedia, the firm\u2019s sales and earnings flourished.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's Blackwell super chip and dominance in AI infrastructure are positioned for continued growth in 2025.\n\nAnalyst Dan Niles, however, cautions against overoptimism, pointing to potential supply constraints and a possible mid-year AI \"digestion phase\" that could rein in expectations.\n\nLike this story?

Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver.\n\n\n\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on Google\u2019s search engine. GOOGL outperformed its industry in the trailing 12 months. However, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\n\n\nCisco shares have narrowly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+21% vs. +20.2%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Hovnanian have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the past year (-27.6% vs. -4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $749 million is facing profitability issues due to declining margins and heavy reliance on incentives to drive affordability. Elevated land investments and regional concentration increase vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\n\n\nReliance on incentives heightens financial risks, while competition and external disruptions threaten growth and market position. Nevertheless, Hovnanian has demonstrated strong revenue growth and operational efficiency, capitalizing on resilient housing demand and effective sales strategies.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on expanding its community footprint and quick move-in homes positions it for sustained growth. Strategic land investments boost growth, while cost discipline sustains profitability. With a commitment to aligning growth initiatives with market trends, Hovnanian is well-positioned to deliver strong returns and shareholder value.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Hovnanian here >>>)\n\n\n\nPerma-Pipe International\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Steel - Pipe and Tube industry over the past year (+49.3% vs. +26.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $106.85 million has a backlog which grew 33% to over $100 million by November, reflecting strong demand in key markets like oil and gas and district energy. Geographic diversification, including $61 million in recent contracts across MENA and the Americas, reduces regional risks while positioning the company for growth in energy and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIts focus on high-growth markets aligns with robust infrastructure development, supported by proprietary technologies like the XTRU-THERM insulation system, bolstering market leadership. The company\u2019s tailored solutions cater to high-margin sectors, ensuring operational resilience.\n\n\n\nLong-term demand is underpinned by global steel pipe market growth, fueled by investments in infrastructure and urbanization. However, exposure to cyclical markets, intense competition, geopolitical risks and regulatory compliance costs present challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Perma-Pipe International here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), The Charles Schwab Corp.

            "content": "There\u2019s over 100 challenges to go about completing in Bitlife, with many of them tasking you with living a lifestyle that you likely might not have attempted before. The Alphabet Mafia Challenge, for example, requires you to be an LGBTQIA+ member of the Sicilian Mafia, and eventually, its leader.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nThis challenge, much like the recent Stud Muffin Challenge, can be quite time-consuming and does require a good amount of luck as you try to ascend the Sicilian Mafia\u2019s ranks. To help you out with doing just that, here\u2019s how to complete the Alphabet Mafia Challenge in Bitlife.\n\nHow to complete the Alphabet Mafia Challenge in Bitlife\n\nThe Alphabet Mafia Challenge in Bitlife requires players to complete the following five objectives in a single lifetime:\n\nBe born in Italy\n\nCome out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community\n\nJoin a Mafia family\n\nExtort money from a CEO\n\nBecome the leader of a Mafia family\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s worth noting that to complete this challenge, you will need the Boss Mode Expansion Pack to access Special Careers and join the Sicilian Mafia.\n\nWith that out of the way, it\u2019s time to start life in Italy. You can choose to be born in Italy by chance or by using the God Mode Expansion Pack in Bitlife. If you are using God Mode, you should also set your Special Talent to Crime to make this challenge a little bit easier!\n\nStart life out in Italy. | Image credit: VG247/Candywriter LLC\n\nAdvance through school as you would normally, but as soon as the \u2018Crime\u2019 option is available under \u2018Activities\u2019, begin to engage in as much petty crime as you can, preferably without getting caught. In my experience, robbing peoples houses or mail is a good option until you unlock the ability to steal cars.\n\nBurgle houses and steal cars throughout your childhood. | Image credit: VG247/Candywriter LLC\n\nWith the Crime option available, the \u2018Identity\u2019 option should also be available to you under \u2018Activities\u2019. Use this feature to come out as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community by either changing your sexuality to gay or bisexual, or by changing your gender identity.\n\nChange your gender identity or sexuality using the \u2018Identity\u2019 option under \u2018Activities\u2019. | Image credit: VG247/Candywriter LLC\n\nBeing both Italian and part of the LGBTQIA+ community, that\u2019s two of our objectives complete!\n\nNow that we\u2019ve also started our life of crime, it\u2019s time to try and join a Mafia family. Under the \u2018Occupations\u2019 tab, look at \u2018Special Careers\u2019, select \u2018Mafia\u2019, and choose to try and join the Sicilian Mafia. This will be the only available option to you.\n\nJoin the Sicilian Mafia after leaving school. | Image credit: VG247/Candywriter LLC\n\nIf they do not hire you, you need to commit more crimes and keep applying until they finally take you under their wing. Next, we need to extort money from a CEO for the challenge, and continue committing crimes successfully until we\u2019re promoted to being the leader of the Sicilian Mafia. This isn\u2019t an easy feat!\n\nUnder your job in the \u2018Occupations\u2019 tab, there are various activities and crimes to commit on behalf of your organised crime syndicate. Choose \u2018Extort\u2019 and look for a \u2018Corporate\u2019 local business to steal from, as extorting these businesses will have you directly extorting money from their CEO.\n\nExtort money from a \u2018Corporate\u2019 local business to extort money from their CEO. | Image credit: VG247/Candywriter LLC\n\nIf a Corporate local business is not available for you to extort, I have some bad news. The list of available local businesses to extort does not change during your time in the Sicilian Mafia, meaning that you will need to restart your life and repeat all the prior steps until a Corporate business is available to extort from in this drop-down list.\n\nThat said, if you have the Time Machine Expansion, you can actually travel back a year \u2014 to before you joined the Sicilian Mafia \u2014 and join the syndicate again. You\u2019ll then be presented with a list of different businesses to extort, but may need to repeat the time-travelling process a few times before a Corporate one shows up.\n\nAfter that, you need to keep committing crimes and earning money and notoriety for the Sicilian Mafia. You\u2019ll slowly work your way up the ranks from Associate to Soldier, Caporegime, Underboss, and then Godfather/Godmother.\n\nIn my experience, the easiest way to ascend the ranks \u2014 without being arrested \u2014 was by stealing cars for the Sicilian Mafia every year and completing any contracts they assigned to me. Robbing a bank or robbing a train is also a quick way of getting plenty of money for the Mafia, but you need to be careful to not get caught and arrested.\n\nOnce you reach the Godfather/Godmother rank, you\u2019re seen as the leader of the Sicilian Mafia, and that should be the Alphabet Mafia Challenge completed in Bitlife.\n\nFor more on Bitlife, take a look at how to escape jail, your chances of winning the lottery, and how to make enemies, and how to have twins or triplets.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other AI stocks.\n\nAs per a CNBC report, in 2025, significant changes are expected in global AI regulation, especially in the U.S., the EU, and the UK. President-elect Donald Trump, who is supported by business leaders like Elon Musk, may influence AI policies, with Musk\u2019s experience in AI raising expectations for U.S. advancements. In Europe, the EU\u2019s AI Act has introduced comprehensive regulations, but tensions with U.S. tech companies are still there over its strict measures.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. is considering a more flexible, principles-based approach, especially regarding the use of copyrighted content for AI training. Additionally, U.S. and China relations could affect global AI development, with both countries competing for AI dominance and potentially creating safety regulations to prevent uncontrolled AI advancements.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 AI Stocks That Skyrocketed in Q4 and 14 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street.\n\nNavigating the AI Investment Landscape\n\nAI is driving a major transformation in technology as significant investments are being funneled into infrastructure, data centers, and the AI value chain. Companies are rapidly building out AI infrastructure, with an increasing focus on supply chain components beyond just semiconductors, which highlight potential profits in sectors like memory, cooling, and fiber optics.\n\nJon McNeill, co-founder of Vistashares, discussed the impact of AI infrastructure on investment opportunities in an interview with Romaine Bostick and Scarlet Fu of Bloomberg. He explained that while AI\u2019s impact on data centers is often discussed in terms of semiconductors, the actual supply chain involves different elements, such as memory, cooling, and fiber optics. McNeill emphasized the potential for profits in the AI supply chain, especially for investors looking beyond the major producers to lesser-known companies.\n\nHe also addressed the risks of international investments and noted that while the U.S. dominates the AI sector, Asia is rapidly building its own AI infrastructure. McNeill highlighted the growing value of AI applications in autonomous driving and robotics, which could drive significant economic growth. He pointed to large investments in data centers, such as AWS\u2019 $11 billion investment in Georgia, as signs that this growth will continue, with the major tech companies leading the charge in the AI race.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) provides AI-driven solutions across various platforms, improving cloud services, business collaboration tools, and consumer products, while also focusing on advancing AI research.\n\nAt CES 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced an upgrade for its Google TV operating system as it integrates Gemini into the Google Assistant voice-control system. This upgrade will be rolled out later in the year and it enables more natural conversations with third-party TVs, eliminating the need for the \u201cHey Google\u201d prompt.\n\nIt also makes content search better and offers deeper YouTube integration, including the ability to access Google Photos. The Gemini upgrade will first appear on third-party TVs from brands like Sony, Hisense, and TCL, following its initial release on Google\u2019s streaming box. Additionally, Google previewed an \u201calways-on\u201d mode for certain TVs, which will display useful information when a user approaches. TCL will be the first to implement this feature in late 2025.\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of AI news and ratings you probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nBoth conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions.\n\nIn recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds.\n\nThe trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cThese companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won\u2019t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.\u201d\n\nValuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however.\n\n\u201cThe Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They\u2019re generating \u201ctremendous\u201d revenue for investors\u201d, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \u201cHow much more gain can be made is the question,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It\u2019s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that\u2019s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy.\n\nStory Continues",

They had just spent the last week unpacking, organizing and getting settled in their new home. On Tuesday around 10:45 a.m., Jacobs was at work when he got a text from his nanny, telling him there a large smoke cloud in his backyard.\n\nHe told his nanny to evacuate their home with their daughter and meet them in Santa Monica at a Whole Foods parking lot. The family evacuated with nothing except for the clothes on their backs. They then learned from a neighbor, who had taken a video of their home burning to the ground, that they had lost everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJacob\u2019s wife lost her wedding dress and a bracelet she got from her great-grandmother. He lost items from his grandfather who was in the military in World War II.\n\nThey lost art and wine they\u2019d collected over the years.\n\n\u201cJust basic things you come to love because they\u2019re your own and now they\u2019re gone,\u201d he added.\n\nThe couple had been excited to move to the Palisades, because it had a \u201cneighborhood feel.\u201d There were kids playing on the streets, schools and parks and everything was walkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jacobs and his wife, Taylor, moved with their baby daughter, Theodora, to a new home in Pacific Palisades from Venice (Photo courtesy of Ben Jacobs)\n\n\u201cOur whole world got taken from us in a couple days,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThat neighborhood won\u2019t be the same for another five to 10 years, if not ever. It\u2019s hard to think of where in L.A. we can live in the future that could replicate that feeling.\u201d\n\nFriday was a day of heartbreak in the fire zone, where residents tried to see what was left of their town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSunset Boulevard was more like a ghost town with the homes and businesses in their final state of ruin, no longer smoldering. The sky had cleared for the first time since the fire erupted and the obliterated streets and car husks were made even jarring by their bright blue backdrop.\n\nThere were few signs of the residents who called the neighborhood home \u2014 many of who were frantically trying to get in at the checkpoint a mile away.\n\nBut the area was still cordoned off with law enforcement keeping a tight grip on who could enter.\n\nOne couple said they\u2019d managed to get in on foot from Santa Monica, but for the most part, the destroyed streets were barren. Only first responders and news crews moved up and down the main thoroughfare.\n\nWorried Palisades residents lined up at the foot of Chautauqua Boulevard on Friday afternoon waiting for their first look at their homes since the fire had devastated their neighborhood.\n\nResidents are still not allowed into the area on their own. But a police car was slowly escorting residents, a few at a time, into their homes. Some had no idea what awaited them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers knew their homes had been destroyed and just wanted to see what they could salvage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through the rubble and see if there\u2019s anything left \u2014 any mementos,\u201d said Whitney Farrer, 28, who grew up in the Palisades.\n\nShe said her parents had fled without anything sentimental, thinking they would be able to return the next day.\n\nHer fiance, Kyle Warner, who also grew up in the Palisades, said his family had done the same. He\u2019d seen photos of the home he was about to look at. It looked like a Buddah statue was all that remained. He was hopeful some heirlooms would be there too.\n\nEvan Bishton, 29, had been standing in line for an hour and a half waiting to go up to his family\u2019s home to get medication for his 78-year-old father.\n\nHe, too, had a sense of what he would see there. It seemed like the family home he grew up, which he could spot from the roadside, \u201cwas in good shape.\u201c\n\n\u201cThe smoke is clear enough to where I can get these little glimpses from a distance,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he already knew the apartment building he lived in was gone after being sent photos from a journalist friend.\n\n\u201cObviously it sucks, but like I feel like I lost less compared to these people,\u201d Bishton said, gesturing to the line of people. \u201cSo I feel for them more than anything.\u201d\n\n",

Here's one \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has it all.\n\nChecking off all the boxes\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) has pioneered AI for years. Its researchers developed transformers (the \"T\" in ChatGPT) that paved the way for today's large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe company remains one of the top AI leaders. Google Gemini ranks among the most powerful AI models around. Google Cloud offers a wide range of AI tools to customers. Google Search, YouTube, and Alphabet's other products use AI extensively.\n\nWhile classical computers use bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) that can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously. They can also be \"entangled\" with other qubits that are far away. These characteristics hold the potential for quantum computers to process more information much more quickly than classical computers. Google's recent introduction of its new Willow chip could be a key breakthrough in developing a useful, large-scale quantum computer.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo unit is at the head of the pack in offering robotaxi services. Waymo already offers autonomous ride-hailing in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. It's planning to soon expand into Austin, Atlanta, and Miami.\n\nSure, there have been a few highly publicized glitches with Waymo's service, including an incident where one of its robotaxis drove around in circles in a parking lot repeatedly. However, the self-driving technology is usually reliable and continues to improve. Investors shouldn't dismiss the potential for Waymo to become a major growth driver for Alphabet over the next few years.\n\nMore magnificent than most\n\nAI should serve as a key tailwind for all the Magnificent Seven stocks. Some of them could be winners in quantum computing as well, notably including Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla are focusing on the robotaxi market in different ways.\n\nBut none of the other Magnificent Seven members is as much of a leader in all of these technologies as Alphabet. The company also is more magnificent than most in other important ways.\n\nIf cash is king, Alphabet sits on the throne. The tech giant's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $93.2 billion are greater than any other Magnificent Seven company's cash stockpile. Alphabet is very well-positioned to continue investing in research and development in AI, quantum computing, and robotaxis.\n\nIts stock is also one of the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven based on growth prospects. Only Nvidia has a lower price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio than Alphabet's PEG multiple of 1.27.\n\nTwo things to watch\n\nInvestors should keep their eyes on two things that could negatively impact Alphabet. First, a federal judge ruled in August 2024 that Google broke antitrust laws by creating an illegal monopoly in the search engine market. Google is also embroiled in antitrust litigation related to its digital advertising practices. Second, some believe that generative AI presents a huge threat (perhaps even an existential one) to Google Search.\n\nHowever, Google is appealing the decision about its alleged monopoly in search. Some legal experts believe the company's case is strong and expect relatively narrow remedies rather than major changes that hurt its business.\n\nAs for the generative AI threat, Google Search already incorporates genAI with its AI Overviews. Google's advertising revenue from search continues to grow. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated in the company's third-quarter earnings call that the new feature is increasing search usage and user satisfaction. He added, \"The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they search.\"\n\nPerhaps these issues could become greater problems for Alphabet, but I'm optimistic that they won't. I think Alphabet's leadership in AI, quantum computing, and robotaxis make it one of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.",

(GOOGL) operates as a holding company, providing various internet products such as Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Maps, etc., healthcare services and more. With a market cap of $2.4 trillion, Alphabet operates through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments.\n\nThe internet giant is expected to announce its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 4. Ahead of the event, analysts expect Alphabet to report a profit of $2.12 per share, up a staggering 29.3% from $1.64 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, the company has surpassed Wall Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters. Its EPS for the last reported quarter surged 36.8% year-over-year to $2.12, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 15.9%.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2024, analysts expect Alphabet to deliver an EPS of $8.03, up 38.5% from $5.80 in fiscal 2023. While in fiscal 2025, its earnings are expected to grow 11.1% year-over-year to $8.92 per share.\n\nGOOGL stock has soared 39.7% over the past 52 weeks, substantially outperforming the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 24.2% surge and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund\u2019s (XLC) 32.9% returns during the same time frame.\n\nGOOGL stock price gained over 2.8% in the trading session after the release of its impressive Q3 results on Oct. 29.

            "content": "A new year is upon us, which is also the time when you'll see a lot of writers pitching their best stock pick for the year. I'm not pitching my favorite idea for 2025, though. Instead I'm looking for a stock I'd buy and hold for the next five years.\n\nOn that front, my favorite idea is Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%).\n\nGoogle is an advertising and search juggernaut\n\nAlphabet is the largest digital advertising company in the world. Its Google search engine holds about a 90% global market share. Within the U.S. it has an over 75% market share for desktop searches and 95% for mobile.\n\nWhile Alphabet faces some potential challenges in search through new artificial intelligence (AI) powered search engines, such as SearchGPT and Perplexity AI, the company has some big advantages. The first is that it has massive amounts of search data accumulated through the years along with access to real-time news and data. Its AI models will be trained on this data, so as its search and AI begin to merge it should lead to a better user experience down the road.\n\nIt also has a big advantage on the monetization end. Thanks to its size, Alphabet has scale with both advertisers and search users. Upstarts would need to lose a lot of money to draw users away from Google and eventually try to monetize them.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has a huge opportunity with AI. Historically, the company only serves ads on about 20% of its search queries. With AI Overviews and its Gemini app, it should be able to create new ad forms to monetize some of the 80% of its traffic it currently doesn't serve ads to today.\n\nIn addition to Google, Alphabet also owns the largest streaming platform in the world by viewership, YouTube -- another huge source of ad revenue for the company. YouTube has proven to be a valuable AI training tool as well. Alphabet's new Veo 2 AI video generation tool was trained on YouTube, and the result was a product significantly better than the Sora AI video generator that OpenAI introduced weeks ahead of Veo 2.\n\nIn the same way that Veo 2 has shown to be superior to Sora due to YouTube, Gemini could eventually become much better than ChatGPT due to its ability to train on Google's massive amounts of historical search data.\n\nGoogle Cloud is aiming to be the cloud computing winner\n\nIn addition to getting Alphabet's dominant ad network, investors also get the world's third-largest cloud computing company. Google Cloud currently has about 12% market share, but last quarter it was the fastest-growing of the big three cloud providers with year-over-year revenue growth of 35%.\n\nThe company has also reached a profitability inflection point in this business. Cloud computing is a very capital-intensive, fixed-cost business in which scale is necessary to achieve a profit. Fixed costs are expenses that are present regardless of sales volumes. So once revenue can cover these fixed costs, companies achieve tremendous operating leverage in which profit growth greatly outpaces revenue growth. This was on display last quarter, as Google Cloud's segment operating income surged from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.\n\nAlphabet credited its strong cloud computing growth to customers adopting its AI platform to build and customize their own AI models and applications. It noted that its Gemini model was also gaining a lot of traction, as were its data platform BigQuery and AI-powered cybersecurity solutions Google Threat Intelligence and Security Operations. The company also called out its customized TPUs (tensor processing units), which it uses in conjunction with GPUs (graphic processing units), as a differentiator that reduces inference processing times and lowers costs.\n\nIts custom AI chips should continue to help Google Cloud improve its margins, which only increases the attractiveness of this fast-growing business.\n\nEmerging opportunities for Alphabet as well\n\nIn addition to these established market-leading businesses, Alphabet also has a few emerging businesses that hold a lot of future potential.\n\nOne is Waymo, its self-driving robotaxi unit. While Tesla gets a lot of press for its robotaxi venture, Alphabet is the only company in the U.S. currently delivering paid robotaxi rides. It offers services in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin, with plans to expand to Miami and Atlanta in the U.S. and Tokyo abroad. The company is teaming up with Uber Technologies in several of these U.S. cities for both ride-hailing and Uber Eats delivery, and with taxi company Nihon Kotsu in Japan. Alphabet still needs to lower the costs of the technology to turn this into a profitable venture, but it has taken a clear lead in the space.\n\nThe company also just announced a major breakthrough in its quantum computing unit. One of the biggest issues with quantum computing is that it has been error-prone, but Alphabet's new Willow chip has shown the ability to error correct while processing. Commercial applications for quantum computing are still many years away, but this is another area in which Alphabet has taken the technological lead. Quantum computing, meanwhile, has the potential to be the next big technological breakthrough after AI.\n\nAttractive valuation\n\nDespite Alphabet's many strengths and opportunities, it is one of the cheapest megacap technology stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just above 19.\n\nThat's a bargain for all the opportunities that the company has ahead. As a leader in digital advertising, search, video streaming, cloud computing, autonomous driving, and quantum computing, Alphabet is the one stock I'd want to buy and continue to hold over the next five to 10 years.",

I\u2019ll detail which of these huge firms led the way in share repurchases and also provide insight on whether they\u2019ll be able to do so again in 2025. These companies may also still increase the amount of stock they repurchased in 2024.\n\nGet Apple alerts: Sign Up\n\nApple: The World\u2019s Largest Company and the World\u2019s Largest Buybacks\n\nApple Today AAPL Apple $245.55 -0.28 (-0.11%) 52-Week Range $164.07 \u25bc $260.10 Dividend Yield 0.41% P/E Ratio 38.98 Price Target $244.85 Add to Watchlist\n\nTech giant Apple NASDAQ: AAPL spent the most on stock buybacks in 2024. The company has already reported its full fiscal 2024 results, recording spending just over $100 billion on share repurchases. However, in the calendar year 2024, the company reported just under $78 billion spent on buybacks. The largest of these came in Q2, when the company spent nearly $29 billion. This marked the largest buyback spending in a single quarter in Apple\u2019s history. The company\u2019s level of buyback spending over the last twelve months now sits at its highest level of all time. It has recovered significantly after dipping down in mid-2023.\n\nSo, can Apple do this again in 2025? Back in March, the company authorized $110 billion in buyback power. Since then, Apple has used around half of the authorization, at just over $54 billion. The Apple Board of Directors must authorize a new buyback program if the company wants to maintain this level of spending. That is certainly not something they have had a problem doing in the past. The company is sitting on cash and short-term investments of $65 billion. It also brought in $108 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. As long as the machine keeps chugging along, Apple can keep up the same level of buybacks.\n\nAlphabet: Massive Buybacks and a Strong History of New Authorizations\n\nAlphabet Today GOOGL Alphabet $179.66 -4.90 (-2.65%) 52-Week Range $130.66 \u25bc $207.05 Dividend Yield 0.45% P/E Ratio 22.32 Price Target $210.62 Add to Watchlist\n\nNext up is Google's parent company, Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL. In 2024, the firm spent just under $47 billion on share buybacks. The company\u2019s buyback level has been growing since late 2017. However, the growth rate of its buyback spending has slowed dramatically. In the three years ending Sept. 2021, last-12-months buyback spending had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 74%. In the three years since Sept. 2021, the CAGR has slowed to just 12%.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s latest buyback authorization came in the company\u2019s Q1 earnings report. The figure came in at $70 billion; the company also announced its first-ever dividend. If Alphabet's Q4 buyback spending continues at its 2024 pace, it will use up about $63 billion of this authorization by year-end. Thus, the company will also need to authorize another buyback program. The company authorized a $70 billion buyback program in Q1 of 2022, 2023, and 2024. The company\u2019s cash and short-term investments, as well as free cash flow, sit moderately below their average over the past three years. This may make it unlikely that the firm will announce a buyback authorization larger than $70 billion. However, $70 billion is still doable and adequate.\n\nMeta: Historic Cash and Cash Flow Sets Up Nicely for 2025 Buybacks\n\nMeta Platforms Today META Meta Platforms $683.62 -11.22 (-1.62%) 52-Week Range $414.50 \u25bc $740.91 Dividend Yield 0.29% P/E Ratio 28.58 Price Target $719.26 Add to Watchlist\n\nLast up is Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META. In 2024, the company spent a whopping $40 billion on share buybacks. Unlike the other two firms, Meta's share buyback spending is now well below its peak levels. In the last 12 months, buyback spending has gone down around 13% from the level it reached in early 2022. However, it has spiked massively from its lows in 2023. Two things that do sit at their all-time highs for Meta are its cash and free cash flow generation. As of Q3, the firm was sitting on nearly $71 billion worth of cash and short-term investments. It has also generated over $52 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.\n\nMeta last reported a buyback authorization of $50 billion in Q1 2024. Prior to that, it still had nearly $31 billion left in buyback authorization from 2023. If it continues at a similar buyback pace in Q4, the company could still have over $25 billion in buyback authorization available. Also, due to its historic success, the company can authorize much more for buybacks in 2025.\n\nOverall, assuming the strength of the overall economy holds up in 2025, these firms can likely continue their strong buyback spending.\n\nBefore you consider Apple, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Apple wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Apple currently has a \"Moderate Buy\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

The company eliminated its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a \"Community Notes\" model, much like the one that exists on Elon Musk's X.\n\nAdditionally, Meta removed restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender, and implemented a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high-severity violations. This means fewer posts containing misinformation will be suppressed or taken down.\n\nTrump lauded Meta's changes during a news conference Tuesday.

            "content": "The latest trading session saw Alphabet (GOOGL) ending at $193.88, denoting a -0.82% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.16%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.06%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the internet search leader had gained 5.57% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.17% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.8% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.12, signifying a 29.27% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $81.41 billion, showing a 12.57% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Alphabet. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.08% lower. Currently, Alphabet is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 21.91. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 23.26 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that GOOGL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.24. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Services industry stood at 1.58 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 42, placing it within the top 17% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

            "content": "Right now, there are nine public companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 trillion. As of intra-day trading on Jan. 6, the trillion-dollar club in order from highest to lowest is made up of the following stocks:\n\nApple: $3.7 trillion\n\n$3.7 trillion Nvidia: $3.7 trillion\n\n$3.7 trillion Microsoft: $3.2 trillion\n\n$3.2 trillion Alphabet: $2.4 trillion\n\n$2.4 trillion Amazon: $2.4 trillion\n\n$2.4 trillion Meta Platforms : $1.6 trillion\n\n$1.6 trillion Tesla: $1.3 trillion\n\n$1.3 trillion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: $1.1 trillion\n\n$1.1 trillion Broadcom: $1.1 trillion\n\nAmong these companies, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Broadcom completed stock splits in recent years. Besides each of these companies playing a pioneering role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, each had big run-ups in their respective share prices before splitting their stocks.\n\nDuring the past year, shares of Meta Platforms (META -1.62%)have soared by 76% -- nearly double the gain of the Nasdaq Composite and almost triple that of the S&P 500.\n\nHere's why I think Meta will be the next trillion-dollar stock to explore a split.\n\nWhy might Meta split its stock soon?\n\nIn the graph below, I've annotated the stock splits for each of the trillion-dollar stocks as indicated by the circles with the letter \"S\" in the middle. The overarching trend that can be seen below is that each of these stocks witnessed pronounced and prolonged gains before the split.\n\nOne thing investors have learned during the past year is that Meta's management is serious about investing in AI infrastructure to bolster both its social media and virtual reality ecosystems. Considering Meta has never split its stock, unlike many of its big tech cohorts, I think now is a good time for the company to consider doing one as its AI ambitions begin to take shape and bear fruit.\n\nHow would a stock split affect investors?\n\nStock splits themselves do not change the overall valuation of a company. The reason for this is because during a split, a company's shares outstanding and stock price move by identical but opposite proportions.\n\nFor example, if a company announced a 5-for-1 split, its outstanding share count would increase fivefold while its stock price would decrease by a factor of five. At the end of the day, the company's market cap remains unchanged.\n\nNevertheless, after a split the company's lower share price is perceived as cheaper, so many stocks tend to rise after a split amid increased buying. These dynamics can also be seen in the chart in the prior section.\n\nWhile share prices alone aren't enough to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued, I wouldn't be surprised if some investors see Meta's price of about $620 as expensive. Moreover, given the company's positive momentum during the past year, retail investors in particular may feel that they've missed the boat and that the shares are too pricey. The lower share price upon completing a split should broaden Meta's investor base, and could potentially inspire more enthusiasm for the company amid intense competition in the AI realm.\n\nRegardless of a split, Meta is a solid buy among AI opportunities\n\nThe chart below shows the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Meta benchmarked against the average forward P/E of the S&P 500. Interestingly, Meta's forward P/E of 24 is little different from that of the S&P 500 -- suggesting investors may see an investment in the company as the same as an investment in the broader markets.\n\nTaking this a step further, Meta's valuation could suggest that investors have not yet fully bought into the company's AI aspirations, and so they do not think the company deserves to be trading at a premium.\n\nI don't agree with this assessment. Although Meta has made it clear that its infrastructure investments in chips, hardware, and more will be costly in the near term, I see these as necessary moves for the company to remain competitive.\n\nMeta stock is one to buy hand over fist for investors with a long-term horizon, regardless of a split. Furthermore, I think Meta will continue generating market-beating returns in the long run, and so I would take advantage of its current price action right now.",

TheInstitut du Monde Arabe is spotlighting this very special art of calligraphy in a brand-new exhibition running from February 5 to September 21, 2025.\n\nWith Ecrire ou calligraphier? L'alphabet arabe sublim\u00e9, the IMA takes us on a journey through centuries and lands. Thanks to its rich collections, the art center is able to showcase Arabic script, from the earliest pages of the Koran to street art and contemporary art.\n\nThis exhibition invites us to discover the \"art of the beautifully written\", or khatt, a term that means both writing and calligraphy. In this discipline, the meaning of the words traced is as important as the care and beauty of the lines that form them. This artistic handwriting consolidates or gives new strength to the written word. This art form is used not only in religious and spiritual fields, but also in design andarchitecture, photography, fashion and even everyday life.\n\nFrom the 9th century to the present day, Arabic calligraphy has been the subject of numerous practices and standards. This art has grown and evolved over the centuries. The exhibition even shows the artistic movements that were born of this script. This is how we discover hurufiyya, a movement that emerged in the 1960s to create a pan-Arab visual language through the drawing of letters.\n\nThe Institut du Monde Arabe unveils works by the celebrated Egyptian-Lebanese artist Marie Khouri. This contemporary sculptor is interested in the links between language, the human body and form. Seeking to build bridges between identity, memory and dialogue, she has created the installation I Love: white, curvilinear sculptures that bring words to life in three dimensions.\n\nAn original, poetic theme for an original exhibition, to be discovered at the Institut du Monde Arabe in 2025.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other quantum computing stocks.\n\nQuantum computing is a revolutionary technology that integrates quantum physics properties into a computer. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries by solving complex issues at a rapid pace as compared to traditional computing methods. Notably, businesses across sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation, continue to explore several benefits of quantum computing in a bid to have a competitive edge and fuel innovation.\n\nTrends To Watch Out For in 2025\n\nHeading into 2025, government aid, strategic initiatives, and legislative support for research are some of the key trends likely to fuel growth. In July 2024, US Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet highlighted the Department of Commerce\u2019s announcement that Colorado\u2019s Elevate Quantum was given $40.5 million in federal funding to build the nation\u2019s leading quantum ecosystem.\n\nHickenlooper added that Colorado is regarded as the Silicon Valley of the quantum era, and Elevate Quantum is expected to lead. Hickenlooper went on to say that Quantum is well-placed to revolutionize medical drug discovery, supercharge AI, strengthen US cybersecurity, and support the transition to clean energy.\n\nAlso, in late November 2024, The Senate advanced the Department of Energy (DOE) Quantum Leadership Act of 2024, proposing $2.5 billion over 5 years to fuel US quantum R&D. Notably, the bipartisan bill emphasizes quantum networking, domestic manufacturing, and public-private partnerships to ramp up quantum innovation.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nIndustries Likely to Benefit\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that quantum computers possess the potential to reduce global carbon emissions by 7 gigatons by 2035 and 150 gigatons by the upcoming 30 years, while adding up to $1.3 trillion in value to key transition industries, as per McKinsey. The rapid computational power it promises is expected to revolutionize batteries for electrification, transform carbon-heavy industrial operations, establish cleaner methods for agriculture, and help reimagine fuel\u2019s future.\n\nGrand View Research highlighted that the growth in the quantum computing market in the US should be driven by higher government and private sector investment in quantum technologies. This growth is likely to stem from the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize industries including materials science, drug discovery, and finance.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy for 2025, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 12-15 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw upside to. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 202\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced a significant advancement in quantum computing with the unveiling of its next-generation chip called \u2018Willow\u2019. Willow reflects an improved error correction, which is a critical challenge in quantum computing. With the effective management of errors, the chip ensures more reliable and scalable quantum computations. In benchmark tests, Willow was able to complete computations in under 5 minutes that would have taken most powerful classical supercomputers ~10 septillion years. After the announcement of Willow, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s stock saw a strong increase (up by ~12.5% in just a month) reflecting investor optimism about the company\u2019s technological advancements and their potential market implications.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s Chief Executive stated that Willow is an important step in the company\u2019s journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications across areas such as drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design, and more. Willow can reduce errors exponentially as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) scales up using more qubits. This cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for ~30 years.\n\nMuch of the optimism about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stems from the monetization opportunities that become available with the success of Willow. By offering Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) via Google Cloud, the company can monetize its quantum technology through subscription-based models, creating a recurring revenue stream. Furthermore, Willow\u2019s computational power can significantly ramp up drug discovery and development, bringing in pharma companies to collaborate with or rely on the company\u2019s quantum solutions.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In 2004, while she was still a meticulous young graduate student, Elaine Sullivan made a discovery that would deepen the history of human writing.\n\nUsing trowels and brushes to remove ancient soil at an Early Bronze Age burial site in Umm el-Marra, Western Syria\u201435 miles from modern-day Aleppo\u2014Sullivan unearthed a pivotal clue: four small clay cylinders inscribed with mysterious symbols.\n\nNow a UC Santa Cruz history professor and renowned Egyptologist, Sullivan recalls her excitement that season when she first spotted the first artifact. \u201cI was running all of the materials through a sieve by hand in order to make sure that we captured any artifacts, no matter how small,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nAt first, the drably colored object nearly escaped her attention.\n\n\u201cWhen I picked the first cylinder up, I thought it was merely a compacted piece of surface dirt,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cOnly after brushing it off did I realize it was an artifact.\u201d\n\nShe quickly called over her advisor, Glenn Schwartz, an archaeologist at Johns Hopkins University, who examined the object with care. But he hesitated to draw any immediate conclusions because early languages are not his primary subject of research.\n\nBut Schwartz, over time, began to explore the possibility that the symbols on the cylinders could be an early Semitic alphabet dating to the Bronze Age.\n\nAfter the discovery of the first artifact, the team continued to dig, uncovering the three additional cylinders, each about two inches long and inscribed with similar markings.\n\nThe discovery was thrilling but mysterious. \u201cAnytime you're working in an ancient context and you find something with writing on it, it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Sullivan explains.\n\nHowever, when the team cleaned the cylinders, they realized the symbols did not belong to any known script like Egyptian hieroglyphs or a recognizable Near Eastern language.\n\nAt the time, the team hoped the symbols might reveal details about the people buried in the tomb, known as Tomb 4.\n\nThe burial site contained other artifacts like pottery, metal vessels, and jewelry, but the cylinders stood out. Despite initial disappointment that the inscriptions didn\u2019t provide immediate answers, their significance has grown clearer over time.\n\n\u201cThe cylinders are remarkable because they force us to rethink where, when, and how the alphabet was invented, and not just because they date at least 500 years earlier than the earliest known examples of alphabetic writing previously identified,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cFurther, they were found in northern Syria, rather than Egypt and the southern Levant, where the earliest known examples had previously been identified.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Elaine discovered the cylinders, she had been working meticulously, exposing and documenting the objects on the floor of the tomb,\u201d Schwartz continued.\u201dIf she hadn't been so careful and so observant, these little clay objects - of the same color and consistency as the clay floor of the tomb - could easily have been overlooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that's why archaeologists haven't found similar objects elsewhere,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cOrdinary excavations are faster paced and don't allow for such careful consideration of every little morsel of dirt turned up.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Schwartz and his colleagues used radiocarbon dating to determine that the tomb burials date to around 2400 BCE, placing the cylinders from Tomb 4 five centuries earlier than any previously known alphabetic inscriptions.\n\nSchwartz presented these findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Researchers this fall, drawing international attention.\n\nFor Sullivan, the emerging importance of this find underscores a key truth about archaeology: artifacts often hold secrets that only later generations can unlock.\n\n\u201cOne of the goals of historians\u2014and archaeologists in particular\u2014is to take great care with the materials we are lucky enough to interact with in modern times,\u201d Sullivan reflects. \u201cYou never know when something will have importance to future scholars or when a new connection will be made.\u201d\n\nSullivan acknowledges the challenges posed by incomplete documentation from past excavations.\n\n\u201cToday as a modern scholar, I\u2019m often annoyed by folks in the late 19th and early 20th century because I don\u2019t think they kept very good records,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe could do much more interesting historical analysis if they had. I try to keep that in mind when I\u2019m excavating today; scholars of the future are counting on us to leave the best documentation we can.\u201d\n\nThe story of the Umm el-Marra cylinders highlights the patience and collaboration that scholarship demands.\n\n\u201cThese cylinders were unexpected artifacts, and their meaning was unclear to us when we found them,\u201d Sullivan notes. \u201cIt has taken Dr. Schwartz years to research, develop, and propose this theory, but that is often how scholarship works. It is a process.\u201d",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +11.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 10.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +29.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.02 points to a change of +38.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.92 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues",

A U.S. appeals court will hear Google's appeal of that decision later this month.The tech giant has said it does not exert enough control over contract workers to be considered their joint employer. The company last year eliminated a $15-an-hour minimum wage for contractors and made other changes designed to avoid having to bargain with unions.The new complaint will be heard by an administrative judge whose decision can be reviewed by the five-member board.Google and the Alphabet Workers Union, an affiliate of the Communication Workers of America union, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Google has faced an uptick in labor organizing in the United States and abroad in recent years, including a series of worker protests over the company's business and employment policies.The standard for determining when businesses are joint employers of contract and franchise workers has been in flux since the Obama administration.A 2024 NLRB rule that made it easier to hold companies liable as joint employers was struck down in court, and appointees of Republican President-elect Donald Trump are expected to replace it with a more business-friendly standard.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)",

            "content": "When was the last time a speaker of the Western dialect of Armenian named one of their sons after the most prominent king of Bagratid Armenia, Kakig (\u0533\u0561\u0563\u056b\u056f)? Though some boys might be called by that name when involved in boyish mischief, no mother or father is so cruel as to call their still innocent newborn a \u201cLittle Shit.\u201d I\u2019ve known several Gagiks, but I\u2019ve never met a single living, breathing Kakig in the flesh. When I was a boy, my parents would call me Hratchig, but when I grew up, they started calling me Hratch. Imagine a poor little Kakig already slandered from birth who, leaving his boyhood behind, becomes a big old Kak\u2026\n\nThe name \u201cKakig\u201d is just one example of a shift that occurred in the language of the Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire \u2014 that is, Western Armenians \u2014 the true cause of which most speakers of the dialect aren\u2019t even aware. The few who are aware of the cause don\u2019t care, and the aware and unaware alike are eager to preserve what they view as their cultural heritage. It was, after all, Western Armenians who were subjected to the Armenian Genocide. Hanging onto the Western Armenian dialect thus becomes a sort of act of defiance in their minds.\n\nBut, as I will argue, those who don\u2019t know the reason why Western Armenian turns Gagiks into Kakigs, should know; those who do know and don\u2019t care, should care; and all of those who wish to preserve it should not only embrace the dialect\u2019s demise, but do everything they can to accelerate its disappearance in favor of a much-needed language reform, both written and oral.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO classified Western Armenian as a \u201cdefinitely endangered language.\u201d This declaration immediately raised awareness of its impending extinction and kicked off a number of programs meant to preserve and promote Western Armenian. The Gulbenkian Foundation is at the forefront of these efforts, implementing a number of programs including translations and language learning initiatives to that end. Numerous articles and appeals have been issued urging its preservation, as well.\n\nDespite the fact that the Western Armenian dialect is the dialect of Armenian I happen to feel more comfortable speaking, my personal habits and what I\u2019m most comfortable with are not more important than what is right. That it is not right, I will now show.\n\nTake a look at the following letters of the Armenian alphabet and note any irregularities. What do you see?\n\n\u0531\u0561 \u0533\u0563 \u0535\u0565 \u0536\u0566 \u0537\u0567 \u0538\u0568 \u0539\u0569 \u053a\u056a \u053b\u056b \u053c\u056c \u053d\u056d \u053f\u056f \u0540\u0570 \u0542\u0572 \u0543\u0573 \u0544\u0574 \u0545\u0575 \u0546\u0576 \u0547\u0577 \u0549\u0579 \u054a\u057a \u054d\u057d \u054e\u057e \u054f\u057f \u0550\u0580 \u0553\u0583 \u0554\u0584 \u0555\u0585 \u0556\u0586\n\nEven one with a passing familiarity with the alphabet will immediately notice that there are several letters missing, namely, \u0532\u0562, \u0534\u0564, \u053e\u056e, \u0541\u0571, \u0548\u0578, \u054b\u057b, \u054c\u057c, \u0551\u0581 and \u0552\u0582. But why are they missing?\n\nThe above is the so-called Armeno-Turkish script (as found in \u201cOn the Armeno-Turkish Alphabet\u201d by Andrew Pratt from 1866). What is Armeno-Turkish? When the Armenians who lived under the Ottoman Empire \u2014 that is, Western Armenians \u2014 had nearly forgotten their mother tongue and knowledge of the Armenian language was at a low point, many of our immediate ancestors couldn\u2019t speak Armenian at all and expressed themselves exclusively in Turkish. The only Armenian many of them managed to learn was the alphabet, even though they couldn\u2019t speak a word of the language itself. The result was that many Western Armenians, up to the generation just before the Genocide, read and wrote using Armenian letters but in the Turkish language. This script, Turkish words in Armenian letters, is Armeno-Turkish. The equivalent today would be the way many Armenians send text messages \u2014 that is, using Armenian words but writing them in Latin letters. Armeno-Turkish is the reverse of this \u2014 Turkish words using Armenian letters.\n\nArmeno-Turkish wasn\u2019t limited to personal communications. There were entire newspapers printed and circulated in Armeno-Turkish, including the most influential Armenian newspaper of its time, called Manzumei Efkar (meaning Range of Opinions in Turkish), which ran from 1866 to 1917. Imagine if an Armenian language news site began writing Armenian language articles the way Armenians text in Latin letters. It would indeed be a linguistic abomination!\n\nWhen the Turkish language is rendered in our alphabet, a number of letters whose sounds aren\u2019t utilized in Turkish become superfluous. Yes, they are the very same letters that were missing from the above list: \u0532\u0562, \u0534\u0564, \u053e\u056e, \u0541\u0571, \u0548\u0578, \u054b\u057b, \u054c\u057c, \u0551\u0581 and \u0552\u0582. Notice that these letters are none other than the sounds that are incorrectly pronounced in the Western Armenian dialect, since the latter is the phonetic counterpart to the alphabetic Armeno-Turkish script.\n\nThis is the reason why the Armenian alphabet for Western Armenian speakers seemingly has superfluous letters. It\u2019s not that Armenian has two identical P\u2019s (\u0532, \u0553), T\u2019s (\u0534 ,\u0539), Ts\u2019s (\u0551, \u0541) and Ch\u2019s (\u0549, \u054b) and makes no real distinction between the two R\u2019s (\u0550, \u054c). It\u2019s that the Turkish language makes no use of those sounds. The Western Armenian dialect\u2019s Armeno-Turkish pronunciations made them obsolete. Note that the only reason \u0533 was not dropped from the Armeno-Turkish script is that \u0533 represented \u0642 (q\u0101f), the guttural K sound from Arabic, whereas \u0554 represented \u0643 (k\u0101f ), a standard K sound as in \u201cKakig\u201d. Nevertheless, Western Armenian lost the sound of the letter \u053f, which in Armeno-Turkish represented a \u06af\u200e, a letter not found in Arabic but part of the Perso-Arabic script used by the Ottomans and which represented a G sound, as in \u201cGagik\u201d.\n\nThe same thing occurred to the Greek language under Turkish influence. Turkish-speaking Greeks living in Asia Minor called Karamanlides similarly saw their alphabet transformed under Turkish language influence. The familiar Greek A (alpha), B (beta), \u0393 (gamma) and \u0394 (delta) for Karamanli Greeks became A, \u03a0\u02d9, \u0394\u0396 and \u03a4\u0396. A remained the same, but beta was represented by the letter \u03a0 (pi) accented with a dot, though still a \u201cb\u201d sound as in \u201cbat\u201d. \u201cB\u201d represented a \u201cv\u201d sound in Turkish (following its betacism in the modern Greek language, where \u201cb\u201d sounds naturally turn into \u201cv\u201d sounds and vice versa). Note also \u0394\u0396 in the place of \u0393, representing a \u201cj\u201d sound as in \u201cjob,\u201d and TZ instead of \u0394, representing a \u201cch\u201d sound as in \u201cchair\u201d. As the Greek alphabet is shorter than the Armenian alphabet, many sounds had to be represented using a combination of two letters. For this reason, Armenian was regarded by many as a superior vehicle for representing the sounds of the Turkish language and was preferred over Greek and Perso-Arabic.\n\nDo Greeks wish to preserve the Karamanli Greek script? The Karamanli Greeks certainly might, but it is so far from actual Greek that the only reason to preserve it would be for its historical value rather than to perpetuate it in schools.\n\nIn fact, the Western Armenian dialect should really be called nothing other than Armeno-Turkish, since it\u2019s simply the way the Turkish-speaking Armenians of Constantinople spoke Armenian under the influence of Turkish, their dominant language. It\u2019s true that the roots of the Western Armenian dialect lie as far back as Middle Armenian, where we see the beginning of what would become modern Western Armenian.\n\nYet, calling the dialect \u201cWestern\u201d Armenian, while geographically accurate, obscures the fact that it is, in essence, Armenian spoken with a Turkish accent. That this would occur after hundreds of years is not surprising. Its equivalent is the Persian Armenian accent, so intimately familiar to us and unfortunately mocked on all sides. Western Armenian is how a native Turkish speaker would speak Armenian, just as Persian Armenian is how a native Farsi speaker would speak Armenian.\n\nI imagine no one is anxious about preserving the defunct Armeno-Turkish script. Why would they be? It\u2019s merely an impoverished form of the Armenian alphabet. And so, why would the Armeno-Turkish pronunciations that correspond to that script, i.e. the Western Armenian dialect, be preserved?\n\nNor is this argument motivated by any political consideration. Even if Turkey and Armenia were historically best friends and allies, and the Turks didn\u2019t feel they have a divine right to rule over Armenians as their masters, Armeno-Turkish on its own merits severely limits and disfigures the sounds of the Armenian language, causing redundant, vestigial letters and undue difficulty in spelling. In other words, even if it were, for example, Armeno-Greek, if it caused the same atrophying of the language that Armeno-Turkish does, it would no less need to be returned to its roots and reformed.\n\nThe disfigurement of the Armenian alphabet by Armeno-Turkish/Western Armenian is on par with, and in some way worse than, the Bolshevik/Abeghian disfigurement of the Armenian alphabet in 1922, which, along with a handful of niggling little changes, deleted the letters \u0537 and \u0555, eliminated \u0552 as an independent letter, and appended \u0587 as an independent letter, for some reason.\n\nThough some of the more obnoxious changes were later walked back, this pseudo-reform has left its mark on the language of post-Soviet Armenia to this day. Western Armenians who rightly decry that unnecessary, politically-motivated Soviet disfigurement of the Armenian language and advocate for its return to the Mashtotsian orthography used by Armenians east and west who weren\u2019t ruled by Bolshevik revolutionaries, don\u2019t have a leg to stand on when holding onto their dialect, which makes nine whole letters obsolete!\n\nWestern Armenians should come to terms with this fact: the Armenian they speak is essentially Armeno-Turkish. It was the language the Armenians of Constantinople spoke under the influence of Turkish language dominance. Hagop Baronian gives us a lively picture of these Armenians of Bolis. Some, he said, would mix Turkish into their Armenian, but many more mixed a little Armenian into their Turkish.\n\nBut Constantinople is long gone, and today Western Armenians from Argentina to Zimbabwe know enough Armenian to express themselves not only in Armenian letters but in the Armenian language, as well. This didn\u2019t happen magically; it is due to the admirable efforts of Western Armenians to encourage Armenian over Turkish, taking on the Herculean task of preserving and promoting the Armenian language in exile without any kind of state backing.\n\nThe Armeno-Turkish/Western Armenian dialect being obsolete, it should go by the wayside, and its speakers should not feel the least anxiety about it. Ultimately, to preserve the Western Armenian dialect isn\u2019t to preserve Armenian; rather, it is to preserve a decayed version of Armenian, which is no preservation at all, especially when its truer form, the Eastern Armenian dialect, has been preserved and is extant.\n\nNote that I say the \u201cdialect\u201d of Western Armenian should not be preserved, not its orthography, which is proper Mashtotsian, used also by Eastern Armenians from Iran. The Armenians of the Republic should adopt the orthography of Western and Persian Armenians, not vice versa, as it is sometimes suggested. Perhaps with Russian influence in the country at an ebb, they can be convinced that the orthography they have utilized since 1940 was nothing more than part of the Bolshevik Likbez policy of the 1920s and admit the need for an actual reformation of orthography to its roots as opposed to the politically-motivated Bolshevik deformation.\n\nNor do I say Western Armenian\u2019s vocabulary should be destroyed, for its vocabulary, consciously rooted in Classical Armenian, is its greatest contribution to modern Armenian. Western Armenians adopted the superior approach to coining new words and advancing language, namely, using one\u2019s own resources and drawing from one\u2019s roots, contrary to the Russian Armenians who adopted the Russian approach to modernization and language development, which included endless borrowing.\n\nIn fact, if one wishes to discover my motive for wanting to get rid of the Western Armenian dialect, it lies in Western Armenian\u2019s own linguistic conscientiousness. In effect, the wish to get rid of the Western Armenian dialect is a logical development of Western Armenian\u2019s own linguistic principles \u2014 drawing on Classical Armenian to coin new words and preserve the language in the face of disfiguring and obliterating encroachments from foreign languages. It is precisely Western Armenian\u2019s linguistic conscientiousness that now seeks to destroy the dialect.\n\nThose who grew up speaking the dialect and are accustomed to it can continue speaking it until they breathe their last breath, and no one should bother them if that\u2019s what they know and feel comfortable with. But what their children and the coming generations should be taught is altogether a different question. Our little Kakigs should be taught the Armenian that is closest to how Armenian should sound, which is Eastern Armenian. A good Western Armenian saying comes to mind here, which is said to those who take something too far, and which some readers will no doubt be saying to me now about this proposal:\n\n\u0540\u0580\u0561\u0579\u055d \u0554\u0561\u0584\u0568 \u0574\u056b \u0570\u0561\u0576\u0565\u0580:\n\nTo which I say:\n\n\u053b\u0576\u0579\u0578\u055e\u0582: \u0535\u0569\u0567 \u0554\u0561\u0584 \u0567 \u0576\u0567 \u0569\u0578\u0572 \u0570\u0561\u0576\u0565\u0576\u0584\u2026\n\nThe Armenian language stands in need of new reforms, but not reforms imposed on it by foreign revolutionaries in pursuit of their own political goals and interests, as happened in Soviet Armenia in the 1920s and again in the 1940s. (No, Papa Lenin and Papa Stalin didn\u2019t care about Armenian literacy rates\u2026)\n\nThe Armenian language as a whole needs reforms that will reconnect it with its own roots, since it is from the roots that both plants and languages alike receive their impulse to true growth, as opposed to artificial grafting of foreign branches and languages. My arguments on the Western Armenian dialect stem from this same root, and my hope is that they will be used as fertilizer to help the Armenian language grow in the healthiest and best way possible. And if anything can be used as fertilizer, it\u2019s Kakig\u2026",

            "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has taken the stock market by storm. The S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) has advanced 55% in the last two years, and AI promises to drive more upside in the coming years as it boosts productivity and efficiency across industries.\n\nExperts have compared AI to transformative events like the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, and the internet. Technological shifts of that magnitude come along maybe once in a decade, and investors that want to benefit as the AI boom unfolds should be buying stocks today.\n\nWall Street is currently fixated on AI agents, which differ slightly from traditional AI copilots. The agentic AI market is projected to increase at 45% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%) is well positioned to capitalize on that spending, and the stock price is quite attractive.\n\nHere's why Alphabet is my pick for the best AI stock to buy right now.\n\nAI agents will augment human workforces in the future\n\nThe precise definition of artificial intelligence (AI) agent varies depending on the source, and often overlaps with the description of traditional AI copilots. But the basic difference is this: Traditional AI copilots can do simple things like summarize service issues and suggest solutions, whereas AI agents can handle more complex tasks like fixing customer service issues without assistance.\n\nExperts envision a future where most enterprises augment human employees with teams of AI agents, which will essentially function as digital workers assigned to specific tasks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a recent interview said his company may someday employ 50,000 people, but it will have 100 million AI agents working under those employees.\n\nAlphabet is a recognized technology leader in AI cloud services\n\nAlphabet-subsidiary Google is a long-standing leader in AI research, and the company is using that expertise to create new monetization opportunities across its advertising and cloud businesses. For instance, generative AI overviews in Google Search are increasing usage and satisfaction, which further cements its leadership in search advertising.\n\nHowever, Google's largest and most compelling opportunity lies in cloud computing. In the past year, Forrester Research has recognized the company as leader in AI infrastructure solutions, machine learnings platforms, and foundational large language models. In one report, analyst Mike Gualtieri commented, \"Google is the best positioned hyperscaler for AI. Google has enough differentiation in AI from other hyperscalers that enterprises may decide to migrate from their existing hyperscaler to Google.\"\n\nGoogle is currently the third largest public cloud in terms of revenue. The company accounted for 13% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the third quarter, while Amazon and Microsoft accounted for 31% and 20%, respectively. But Google gained a percentage point of market share during the last year as its AI business expanded. Nearly 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\n\nThe company could continue to gain market share in cloud services as enterprises lean into agentic AI. Google earlier this year added agent-building capabilities to Vertex AI, a platform that lets developers train and fine-tune machine learning models (including Google's Gemini) and deploy them in AI applications. Vertex AI Agent Builder positions Google to be a major player as agentic AI spending grows into a $50 billion market by 2030.\n\nHere are example use cases: ADT is developing AI agents to help customers select and set up home security systems. InterContinental Hotels Group is creating AI agents that assist travelers in planning vacations. And Mayo Clinic researchers are building AI agents that help healthcare professionals search clinical data.\n\nAlphabet stock trades at a reasonable valuation\n\nThe International Data Corporation estimates spending on public cloud services will increase at 19% annually through 2028. But spending on artificial intelligence platforms like Google's Vertex AI is projected to increase at 51% annually during that period, driven in part by demand for agentic AI solutions.\n\nWall Street estimates Alphabet's earnings will increase at 16% annually in the next three years, but its bottom line may grow faster if the company keeps gaining share in cloud infrastructure and platform services, which seems plausible given its position as a recognized leader across several AI product categories.\n\nHowever, even without upward revisions to earnings estimates, the current valuation of 25 times earnings looks quite reasonable. That's why Alphabet is currently my top AI stock, and why I think long-term investors should consider buying a small position today.",

Morgan likes Alphabet for 2025\n\nOn Monday, sell-side analyst Doug Anmuth at J.P. Morgan issued a positive note on Alphabet while retaining his buy rating on shares, with a $232 price target. Alphabet entered the day just over $193 per share, so Anmuth's target would amount to roughly 20% upside.\n\nAnmuth believes Alphabet has established itself as a formidable player in AI, whereas this time last year investors were worried about how generative AI might disrupt the search business. However, Anmuth sees Alphabet as a driver of the technology and a beneficiary rather than victim of the AI revolution. Of note, Alphabet introduced its new Gemini 2.0 large language model last month, largely to a positive reception.\n\nAnmuth sees the search business continuing to grow another 11% this year. Aside from search, Anmuth also sees underappreciated growth potential for Alphabet's cloud business as well as YouTube subscriptions. Finally, Anmuth pointed out that Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment, composed of moonshot projects like Waymo and Verily, may be seeing some of those bets actually come to fruition. He noted other bets revenue was up 43% in the first nine months of 2024 with almost no increase in operating losses, signaling some of those bets may be getting closer to profitability.\n\nAlphabet is the cheapest of the Mag 7\n\nThanks to the Alphabet losing its antitrust ruling last year, its shares have been capped at a very cheap valuation of just 22 times this year's earnings estimates, the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" But Anmuth also touched on this topic in his note, saying that the Trump administration Justice Department may go for a less onerous penalty than the prior administration.\n\nAll in all, Alphabet remains one of the cheapest ways to play the AI revolution in 2025.",

( ) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 18x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.\n\nRecent times have been advantageous for Alphabet as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nAlphabet's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the market.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 45% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 46% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 14% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Alphabet's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of Alphabet's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

Among its most notable achievements was that it was able to reduce errors exponentially as Alphabet scaled up to using more qubits. The company said that had been a challenge in quantum error correction for nearly 30 years.\n\nThe other significant achievement was that Willow made a benchmark computation that would have taken one of today's top supercomputers 10 septillion (or 10^25) years in less than five minutes, showing the tremendous leap that quantum computing can achieve.\n\nIt's unclear what the upshot of Willow will be, but Google's blog noted that \"It's a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built,\" which could ultimately high-scale algorithms at very fast speeds.\n\nAlphabet's accomplishment also set off a boom in quantum computing stocks as Rigetti Computing, Quantum Computing, and D-Wave Quantum all more than doubled last month.\n\nA person clicking on a search bar.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's next for Alphabet\n\nPerception is arguably as important as reality in the tech arms race. Shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, Alphabet was perceived as a loser after Bard, its first generative AI chatbot, made mistakes at its first presentation.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has overcome that setback, replaced Bard with Gemini, and added an AI assistant to Google searches to keep users in its ecosystem. Thus far, the business continues to perform well, also with steady growth in revenue and profits. Alphabet is also cheaper than most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, making it a better value.\n\nIt could still be years before quantum computing moves the needle for Alphabet, but last month's announcement should reassure investors that the company remains on the cutting edge of technology, which could be as important to the stock as delivering meaningful business gains.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Tech Giants Pivot Towards AI Domination\n\nIn a rapidly evolving financial landscape, Fernbridge Capital Management LP has made waves by profoundly boosting its stake in Alphabet Inc. by an astonishing 130%. This strategic move, detailed in their recent regulatory filing, underscores a growing belief in Alphabet\u2019s potential amidst its leap towards artificial intelligence and other groundbreaking technologies. An additional acquisition of 128,495 shares now elevates their total to 227,328 valued at nearly $37.7 million, a significant marker reflecting Alphabet\u2019s prominence as one of Fernbridge\u2019s largest investments.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Strategic Leap into the Future\n\nAs technological innovation drives corporate decisions, Alphabet has positioned itself at the forefront of the AI revolution.

            "content": "Alphabets might be 500 years older than previously believed, according to a recently published study by a Johns Hopkins University archaeologist.\n\nDuring a 2004 dig of a tomb in the ancient city of Umm el-Marra in northern Syria, Glenn Schwartz and a team of researchers discovered four small clay cylinders, each bearing a series of inscribed characters.\n\nTwenty years later, Schwartz argued that those artifacts, approximately four to five centimeters in length (~1.6 inches) and dating to around 2400 BCE, could represent the world\u2019s oldest alphabetic writing system. Previously, scholars believed that the first alphabet was a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Egypt before 1900 BCE.\n\nDuring a November presentation of his findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research in Boston, shared with Hyperallergic, Schwartz said that cuneiform was previously the only writing system accounted for in Syria during the Early Bronze Age when the cylinders are believed to have been inscribed.\n\nSchwartz discovered the artifacts in 2004 but has not presented them widely until now.\n\nThe symbols carved into the artifacts are distinct from characters associated with cuneiform, according to Schwartz, suggesting a new form of writing entirely. While cuneiform is considered the world\u2019s oldest writing system, having emerged before 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia, it is neither an alphabet nor a language but rather a set of characters denoting syllables.\n\nSchwartz explained that the clay cylinders resemble beads, which could mean they were strung together to function as a tag in the Umm el-Marra tomb.\n\nOne symbol carved into the clay is a circle with two dots, which appears on two of the cylinders. That recurrence, Schwartz said, strengthens the case that the symbols are actually alphabetic writing.\n\n\u201cThe longer the sequence of symbols, the more likely that writing is involved,\u201d Schwartz said, distinguishing alphabetic writing from semasiography, which refers to \u201csigns functioning as mnemonic devices to represent ideas but not language.\u201d\n\nThe small cylinders are about 1 centimeter (~0.4 inches) thick.\n\nHe added that characters from the clay fragments don\u2019t convincingly match other writing systems, like hieroglyphs, suggesting that an original alphabet had formed at Umm el-Marra\u2019s temple complex. Explaining that an alphabet may have formed in the ancient city to address increasing administrative needs, Schwartz invited philologists to decode its meaning.\n\n\u201cWriting often appears when a complex, urban society develops, which was certainly the case in the third millennium northern Levant,\u201d Schwartz said in his remarks. \u201cIf the Umm el-Marra cylinders are tags or labels, this would be consistent with the association of writing with increasing administrative needs.\u201d",

            "content": "YouTube, the world\u2019s leading video-sharing platform, has emerged as a juggernaut within Alphabet's vast ecosystem, generating a monumental $50 billion in revenue. This success story highlights the power of digital content and the exceptional growth of YouTube as it continues to redefine the media landscape and contribute significantly to Alphabet's overall financial success. The journey of YouTube, from its humble beginnings to its dominant position today, is a testament to the company\u2019s visionary strategies and innovations.\n\nYouTube's Evolution: From a Startup to a Billion-Dollar Platform\n\nFounded in 2005 by three former PayPal employees\u2014Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim\u2014YouTube was initially conceived as a platform to allow users to upload and share videos. Google acquired the platform in 2006 for $1.65 billion, a price that seemed steep at the time but would later prove to be a visionary move. What Google saw in YouTube was not just the ability to upload videos, but the potential to revolutionize how people consume and interact with video content online.\n\nOver the years, YouTube evolved from a user-generated content hub to a multi-faceted platform that serves content creators, advertisers, and viewers across the globe. In addition to offering a space for people to share personal videos, the platform introduced features like monetization, live streaming, YouTube Originals, and YouTube TV. These developments further expanded the platform\u2019s reach, making it a central player in the entertainment and advertising industries.\n\nSUBSCRIBE MUSIC CHANNEL\n\nRevenue Growth: The $50 Billion Milestone\n\nThe $50 billion milestone, achieved in 2024, represents a significant achievement for YouTube and Alphabet. The platform's revenue comes primarily from three sources: advertising, YouTube Premium (subscription services), and YouTube TV.\n\nThe bulk of YouTube\u2019s revenue comes from its advertising model, which leverages Google\u2019s advertising technology to connect brands with targeted audiences. With over 2 billion logged-in users each month, YouTube\u2019s vast audience offers advertisers a unique opportunity to engage consumers with video ads tailored to their preferences. As video content continues to dominate digital media, advertisers flock to the platform to reach a diverse and global audience. In 2024, YouTube\u2019s ad revenue surpassed $30 billion, driven by the growing popularity of short-form content such as YouTube Shorts, and the increase in connected TV views.\n\nTOP VIDEO TO WATCH\n\nA Focus on Content Creators\n\nOne of YouTube\u2019s most important innovations has been its ability to empower content creators, making it possible for individuals to turn their passion into a full-time career. The platform's monetization tools, such as AdSense and the YouTube Partner Program, enable creators to earn revenue from ads shown on their videos. Some of the world\u2019s top YouTubers, like MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) and PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg), have turned their channels into multimillion-dollar businesses. These success stories illustrate YouTube\u2019s immense potential to generate income not just for Alphabet, but for the millions of creators who rely on the platform for their livelihoods.\n\nMrBeast, for example, is known for his elaborate and expensive challenges, which have earned millions of views. His YouTube channel alone has over 250 million subscribers, and his revenue streams include ads, sponsorships, and merchandise. YouTube\u2019s ability to nurture such high-profile creators is one of the key drivers behind its $50 billion revenue achievement.\n\nIn addition to large-scale creators, YouTube also supports a diverse range of content, from beauty tutorials to educational channels, cooking shows, and fitness influencers. This variety of content makes YouTube a go-to platform for people of all interests and backgrounds, further contributing to its massive revenue.\n\nYouTube Premium and YouTube TV\n\nWhile ad revenue remains YouTube\u2019s primary income source, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV also play a crucial role in diversifying the platform\u2019s revenue streams. YouTube Premium, which allows users to enjoy an ad-free experience and access exclusive content, has attracted millions of subscribers worldwide. Similarly, YouTube TV, a paid live TV service that offers cable-like content with a focus on sports, news, and entertainment, continues to grow in popularity.\n\nBy offering both free and paid services, YouTube caters to a wide array of users, creating multiple pathways to profitability. The introduction of YouTube Shorts, the platform's answer to TikTok, has also contributed to increased engagement and new revenue opportunities, particularly among younger audiences.\n\nThe Future of YouTube\n\nLooking ahead, YouTube\u2019s trajectory appears even more promising. The platform is poised to continue growing with advancements in AI, better content recommendations, and further integration of immersive experiences like virtual reality and augmented reality. As more businesses embrace online video content and advertisers increasingly turn to platforms like YouTube, the company\u2019s revenue is expected to continue its upward momentum.\n\nIn conclusion, YouTube\u2019s $50 billion revenue milestone is a reflection of its strategic investments, its role as a content creation and consumption powerhouse, and its unwavering ability to innovate in an ever-changing digital landscape. As it continues to redefine entertainment and advertising, YouTube is likely to remain a major contributor to Alphabet\u2019s financial success for years to come.",

And, if 2024 was any indication, their influence on the broad market is only trending upward.\n\nThree of the lesser performers in a group of seven high-performing stocks in the technology sector\u2014Apple (+33%), Alphabet (+37%) and Amazon (+50%), all of which have partnerships with the sports industry\u2014far outpaced the S&P 500 (+23%). Along with Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla, those stocks, sometimes referred to as the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d accounted for more than half the gains of the entire cohort of 500 publicly traded companies.\n\nOverall, the stock market had a strong 2024, even as Americans worried about the economy. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high on 57 different days and rose 23% during the year, with interest rate cuts, declining inflation and rising profits among the driving factors.\n\nDuring a time of robust stock market performance, those seven big tech tickers make up roughly 35% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500, up from approximately 30% last year. The contribution of the top seven stocks to the index had hovered around or below 20% for most of the past 40 years. It has risen considerably from 15% on New Year\u2019s Day in 2015, and skyrocketed starting in 2020.\n\nApple, specifically, with a market cap of $3.8 trillion, accounted for 7.65% of the S&P 500 at the start of 2025\u2014the highest percentage for a single stock since at least 1980, according to Yahoo! Finance. There had never even been a $1 trillion American company until Apple reached the milestone in 2018.\n\nApple is one of several large tech companies to strike media rights deals with major sports properties in recent years when it inked a 10-year partnership with MLS in 2022. The tech giant pays $250 million a year for its rights, a drop in the bucket compared to its $383 billion in 2023 revenues.\n\nAlphabet also plunged into sports in 2022 by dishing out $2 billion annually to make YouTube the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket. Google\u2019s parent company earned $307 billion in 2023 revenues.\n\nAmazon, though, was the true pioneer in the space back in 2021 when it bought the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, which costs it just a tick above $1 billion per year. Jeff Bezos\u2019 company, which brought in $575 billion last year, has since one-upped its competitors by landing a share of the next NBA rights package worth roughly $1.8 billion per season from 2025-26 through 2035-36.\n\nWhen Amazon began exclusively broadcasting NFL games a few years ago, the notion of a tech company streaming primetime football seemed bizarre. Now, it\u2019s normal. Both of the 2024 NFL Christmas games broadcast on Netflix ranked among the 50 most-watched U.S. broadcasts of 2024 despite not being available to viewers on traditional TV.",

Naturally, investors are likely wondering how much longer the bull market rally can go.\n\nAlthough no one knows what will definitively happen this year, it's clear the broader market has gotten more expensive.

I agree. And I think Google parent Alphabet will be an obvious winner if that prediction is right -- and therefore a great stock to buy to start the year.\n\nAI agents can perform self-directed tasks to achieve goals set by humans. Instead of only answering questions as chatbots do, they can also go to work on your behalf.\n\nWhy is Alphabet such an exceptional pick to profit from the rise of AI agents? For one thing, the company already offers robust AI agent functionality. Its Gemini large language model (LLM) supports application programming interfaces (APIs) for running AI agents. Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Builder makes creating AI agents quick and easy. Google Agentspace supports enterprise-level AI agents.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem presents a massive opportunity for deploying AI agents, too. The potential applications of AI agents across Google's product range, including Android, Google Pixel phones, and Google Workspace productivity suite, are extensive and readily apparent.\n\nI also like that Alphabet is the biggest bargain among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on one key valuation metric. The tech giant's shares trade at only 21.3 times forward earnings, lower than the forward earnings multiples of the other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nCould regulatory threats derail Alphabet's momentum? Maybe, but I suspect not. Alphabet is appealing an adverse court decision handed down in 2024. I think the company's arguments look pretty solid. Alphabet ranks among the best AI stocks to buy right now, in my opinion.\n\nMicron's $50 billion investment is building America's tech future\n\nAnders Bylund (Micron Technology): I love companies with a long-term vision. Micron Technology is a great example.\n\nThe memory chip maker isn't planning ahead for the next quarter or even the next year. Micron is building an America-centered manufacturing network for the long haul, expecting to invest $50 billion in new and upgraded facilities by 2030.\n\nThe company is building an American tech titan for the ages, and having this crucial hardware provider available should grow more important in the coming years. Micron's world-class memory chips are often seen in the latest AI accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, for example. Apple sources the iPhone's memory chips from various leading suppliers, but Micron is among them and is reportedly in talks to secure a larger iPhone contract in 2026.\n\nMicron's long-term business prospects are downright incredible. At the same time, the company is returning from a multiyear downturn, which started with coronavirus-based materials and engineering talent shortages in 2020. Trailing-12-month revenue has nearly doubled since the summer of 2023, and Micron's free cash flows are back above the breakeven line again -- despite the company's expensive factory-building efforts:\n\nMU Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\n\n\nMU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nBut Wall Street isn't paying attention to Micron's shareholder-friendly business trends. The stock soared and then plunged in 2024, adding up to a full-year price drop of 1.4%. That includes a 14% plunge in December. Micron's shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.3 times sales or 7.6 times forward earnings as of Jan. 2.\n\nIt's a deal, it's a steal, it's a deep-discount sale you don't want to miss in January 2025.\n\nAn attractive, beaten-down stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Shares of Brookfield Renewable hugely underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024 -- while the corporate shares gained barely 4% in the year, units of the partnership fell 13% versus the S&P 500 index's 23% gains. However, there seems to be a disconnect between investor sentiment and Brookfield Renewable's operational performance and growth goals. I believe the stock has a solid chance to recover and rally in 2025.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy companies, with an operating capacity of nearly 37 gigawatts (GW). The company, however, is developing nearly 200 GW of capacity, reflecting its massive growth potential. More importantly, Brookfield Renewable is steadily growing its cash flows and dividends.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is, in fact, all set to deliver record numbers for 2024, with its funds from operations (FFO) per unit growing by 11% in the third quarter. That puts the company on track to deliver 10%-plus annual FFO per unit growth in line with its long-term goal.\n\nThe real highlight, though, is that 2024 should also be the biggest year for investments into growth for Brookfield Renewable, with the company raising billions of dollars from asset recycling and investing that money, alongside cash flows, into global acquisitions spanning wind, solar, and hydroelectric power assets.\n\nGiven the backdrop, Brookfield Renewable looks like a solid stock to buy in January and hold for 2025 and beyond. The company plans to grow dividends at a rate of 5% to 9% per year, and its shares currently yield a solid 5% yield. As an investor in the U.S., you could avoid filing a K-1 tax form and foreign tax withholding if you buy corporate shares of Brookfield Renewable versus its partnership units.\n\nSnack on this stock\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (PepsiCo): It's a new year, making it an ideal time to take a fresh look at your portfolio. That's especially true following two fantastic years for broader stock market returns. If you do, you might find that PepsiCo fits as one of your first purchases of 2025.\n\nThe beverage and snack foods giant underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2024. That's partly because Wall Street was more interested in tech giants and companies engaged in the AI space. But Pepsi also reported some sluggish sales figures as its core consumer pulled back their spending to save cash. Organic sales growth was just 2% through the first three quarters of the year, management revealed in early October. Compare that to the 10% spike investors saw in 2023 and the 14% surge in the prior year, and it's easy to see why some investors have been disappointed.\n\nBut Pepsi is still a cash- and profit-generating machine, which means there's a good chance at a rebound for this business -- and for its stock returns -- over the next several years. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team are projecting a bit less than 4% organic sales growth for the 2024 year and 8% higher earnings per share in that period. Investors will learn the exact figures, plus Pepsi's initial outlook for 2025, when the company announces Q4 results on Feb. 4.\n\nIn the meantime, there's every reason for shareholders to expect ample direct cash returns from this business as Pepsi sells more snack foods and beverages. For 2024, expected returns of cash to shareholders were billed at $8.2 billion, mainly through dividend payments.\n\nSpeaking of dividends, Pepsi's yield is back above 3.5%, a rate investors haven't seen since the early days of the pandemic. That unusually high payout, along with Pepsi's solid earnings generation, should help cushion returns while investors wait for a growth rebound. The timing of any sales recovery is a big question mark. But Pepsi's dividend payment is not. The Dividend King has hiked its payout in each of the last 51 consecutive years, and it's almost certain that shareholders will benefit from another increase in 2025.\n\nUPS has what it takes to recover in 2025\n\nDaniel Foelber (UPS): UPS is now at its lowest level since July 2020, and I think it's an incredible opportunity for patient investors. But there's no denying the package delivery giant has fallen for many good reasons.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially led to surging volumes and margins for UPS. However, as industrywide growth slowed, UPS struggled to offset declining margins with price increases, further hurting volumes. The company was also dealing with expensive negotiations with the Teamsters Union, which resulted in a new contract. Even as UPS laps initial costs of the new contract, analysts expect its earnings per share to rise by 17% in 2025. UPS made several blunders in recent years and disappointed investors. But the stock has fallen far enough, and UPS is well positioned to return to growth in 2025.\n\nThe company has already made significant investments in expanding routes, so it doesn't have to spend a lot on capital expenditures (capex). In fact, capex is expected to be just $4 billion in 2024, which is less than the $5.4 billion in projected dividends. After 18 months, UPS finally returned to profit and revenue growth, so it is already showing signs of turning things around.\n\nLonger-term, UPS has opportunities to expand its healthcare and small and medium-sized delivery volumes. In March 2024, UPS unveiled a three-year plan that forecast healthcare segment revenue to double by 2026, making time- and temperature-sensitive shipments an integral part of the company's offering.\n\nUPS and its peer FedEx have dirt cheap valuations, but UPS has a far higher yield at 5.3%, making it a more intriguing transportation stock for passive-income investors.\n\nInvestors looking for high-yield dividend stocks at compelling valuations should look closer at UPS now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "In a groundbreaking move set to redefine the financial digital landscape, Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, is reportedly developing a new technology codenamed \u201cAlphabet Quotazione.\u201d This cutting-edge platform aims to transform how financial assets are quoted and traded across global markets, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.\n\nInnovative Integration\n\nAlphabet Quotazione promises to integrate seamlessly with existing financial infrastructures, enabling faster and more accurate quoting of stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. By employing advanced AI algorithms, the platform can process vast amounts of financial data in real-time, ensuring that traders and investors receive the most up-to-date and precise information.\n\nEnhanced Security\n\nSecurity has been a significant concern in the digital trading world, but Alphabet Quotazione addresses this with its blockchain-based secure infrastructure. Each transaction is encoded in a decentralized ledger, minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring transparent quoting practices across various financial markets.\n\nPotential Market Impact\n\nExperts suggest that Alphabet Quotazione could dramatically lower the barriers for individual traders and smaller financial institutions to participate in global markets. This democratization could lead to a surge in market activity and introduce new dynamics in how we perceive and interact with financial assets.\n\nAs Alphabet gears up to launch this revolutionary platform, the financial world is bracing for change. With potential access to Alphabet\u2019s vast resources and technological expertise, Quotazione might just be the key to the future of global finance.\n\nIs Alphabet Quotazione the Future of Finance or a Risky Gamble?\n\nIn the fast-evolving world of finance, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s latest venture, \u201cAlphabet Quotazione,\u201d is capturing attention with its promise to revolutionize the quoting and trading of financial assets. But how will this impact humanity and the development of technology as a whole?\n\nUnveiling Complexities\n\nWhile Alphabet Quotazione intends to democratize financial markets by leveraging AI and blockchain, it brings complex challenges. One significant question arises: Can smaller traders truly compete with giants in this new arena? The platform could offer equal opportunities, but it may inadvertently widen the gap if big players harness AI advancements more effectively. This reveals a dual nature: increased accessibility coupled with potential inequality in tech adoption.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\n\nMoreover, the enhanced capabilities of blockchain can bolster security but also raise environmental concerns. Blockchain mining consumes significant energy, posing sustainability challenges. As the demand for blockchain-driven applications grows, will the environmental impact become a controversial sticking point? Developers must strive for greener solutions without compromising on security.\n\nCultural Shift and Controversy\n\nBeyond the technical, cultural shifts are anticipated. The introduction of advanced trading capabilities might alter traditional investment practices, pushing older financial institutions to adapt swiftly or face obsolescence. As AI-driven systems dominate analysis and decision-making, the role of human intuition comes into question. Is reliance on machines eroding or enhancing our financial acumen?\n\nThe outlook for Alphabet Quotazione is multifaceted. Its successful implementation could herald a new era of financial inclusivity and innovation. However, ensuring equitable access and addressing environmental impact are crucial for its sustainable success. For more insights into emerging technologies and finance, visit Financial Times.",

With Palantir Technologies recently soaring 340% to become the top performer in the S&P 500, many are eager to join the party. However, experts believe there are smarter options for 2025 that offer strong potential.\n\nFirst up is Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

But with a staggering gain of 340%, the stock still managed to end the year as the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nSome investors might be tempted to jump on the bandwagon, even if it's a bit late. I don't think that's the best strategy, though. Here are three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy in 2025 (listed alphabetically) that could be better picks than Palantir.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) delivered an impressive gain of nearly 36% last year, although that return paled in comparison to Palantir's. However, I suspect Alphabet could be a bigger winner in 2025 than Palantir for a few reasons.\n\nProbably the biggest knock against Palantir right now is its valuation. Shares of the AI and data analytics software company trade at close to 159 times forward earnings and nearly 69 times sales. Palantir is growing by leaps and bounds but, in my opinion, not enough to justify its premium price. Alphabet, on the other hand, looks like a bargain with a forward earnings multiple of 21.\n\nI look for strong growth from Alphabet this year. The company's Google Cloud business should have exceptionally good prospects with the continued AI-fueled demand for cloud services. The adoption of AI agents could also take off in 2025, providing another major tailwind for Alphabet.\n\nDon't overlook the potential impact of Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, over the next few years, either. Waymo plans to expand into Atlanta and Austin, Texas, in 2025 in partnership with Uber. Although this business likely won't contribute much revenue to Alphabet this year, it could be a huge growth driver by the end of the decade.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ranked two spots behind Palantir as the No. 3 top stock in the S&P 500 in 2024. Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker soared 171% higher last year. I think this momentum will continue in 2025.\n\nDespite the huge gain last year, Nvidia's valuation isn't all that scary. The stock trades at 31 times forward earnings. That might seem expensive, but it isn't if the company can keep growing robustly.\n\nThe launch of the new Blackwell GPUs should extend Nvidia's robust growth. In an October interview with CNBC, CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for Blackwell as \"insane.\" That aligns with CFO Colette Kress' comment in Nvidia's November earnings call, stating that \"Blackwell demand is staggering.\"\n\nStory Continues",

However, 2025 holds promise for three other artificial intelligence powerhouses that might deliver even greater returns.\n\nFirst up is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which enjoyed a solid 36% stock increase last year. While Palantir\u2019s growth outpaced Alphabet\u2019s, the latter presents a more appealing valuation with a forward earnings multiple of 21, compared to Palantir\u2019s hefty 159. With a surge in demand for cloud services bolstered by AI, Alphabet, especially its Google Cloud, is poised for substantial expansion. Additionally, their self-driving car unit, Waymo, plans exciting expansions, potentially setting the stage for major growth.\n\nNext on the list is Nvidia, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs). With a substantial 171% rise in stock value in the past year, Nvidia maintains a more manageable price-to-earnings ratio of 31. The anticipated launch of their new Blackwell GPUs is said to be met with intense demand, suggesting that their growth trajectory isn\u2019t slowing down anytime soon.\n\nLastly, consider Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Despite a 18% decline last year, AMD is expected to bounce back. The company has reported record revenues and holds a dirt-cheap valuation, making it an enticing option for investors looking for growth in a competitive landscape.\n\nTogether, these stocks offer exciting opportunities for savvy investors in the coming year.\n\nAI Stocks to Watch in 2025: Promising Returns Beyond Palantir\n\nAs the investment landscape continues to be shaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), a number of companies promise exciting opportunities for investors. While Palantir Technologies (PLTR) saw a remarkable 340% stock increase last year, there are three key players in the AI sector to watch in 2025. These companies not only demonstrate potential for growth but also offer appealing valuations, innovative products, and significant market prospects.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, recorded a 36% stock increase last year, positioning itself as a formidable contender in the AI-driven tech space. What makes Alphabet particularly attractive is its comparatively low forward earnings multiple of 21. This valuates the company favorably against Palantir\u2019s extravagant ratio of 159.\n\nFeatures and Innovations:\n\n\u2013 Google Cloud Expansion: With an increasing reliance on cloud services fueled by AI advancements, Google Cloud is set for substantial growth, offering services that span from machine learning to data analytics.\n\n\u2013 Waymo Developments: Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit, Waymo, is preparing for significant expansions. This could greatly enhance Alphabet\u2019s market presence in the autonomous vehicle sector.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNvidia has firmly established itself in the AI and tech landscape with a remarkable 171% rise in stock last year. With its current price-to-earnings ratio of 31, Nvidia maintains a healthy balance between growth and valuation, making it an attractive option for investors.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\n\u2013 Pros: Known for revolutionizing the GPU market, Nvidia\u2019s anticipated launch of Blackwell GPUs is expected to meet immense market demand, reinforcing its position as an industry leader.\n\n\u2013 Cons: While growth seems inevitable, Nvidia operates in a highly competitive environment where rapid technological changes could present challenges.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAfter experiencing an 18% decline last year, Advanced Micro Devices presents a unique opportunity as it looks to rebound. The company has documented record revenues, which are a promising sign for investors.\n\nLimitations and Use Cases:\n\n\u2013 Valuation: AMD\u2019s current valuation is appealing, particularly in comparison to its peers, making it a potential undervalued gem in the technology sector.\n\n\u2013 Product Applications: AMD\u2019s chips are increasingly utilized in various fields, including gaming, data centers, and AI applications, highlighting the versatile demand for their technology.\n\nMarket Analysis and Predictions\n\nAs we venture into 2025, each of these companies is positioned to capitalize on AI\u2019s accelerating distribution across industries. Analysts predict that AI will continue to reshape markets, offering new avenues for revenue and growth. Investors should closely monitor the innovations and market performances of Alphabet, Nvidia, and AMD to identify optimal entry points for potential investment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Palantir Technologies shines with a substantial past performance, Alphabet, Nvidia, and AMD emerge as compelling alternatives with strong growth potential and more manageable valuations. By strategically investing in these companies, savvy investors could see significant returns as the AI revolution unfolds.\n\nFor more insights into the future of technology and innovative companies, visit CNBC.",

However, alternative options in the AI realm could offer more promise as 2025 unfolds. Here are three AI stocks worth considering, potentially outperforming Palantir this year.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nWhile Alphabet\u2019s stock rose nearly 36% last year, its potential growth in 2025 could surpass that of Palantir. Valuation is a key factor; while Palantir trades at an elevated multiple, Alphabet\u2019s forward earnings multiple of 21 appears more reasonable. The surge in demand for AI-driven cloud services positions Google Cloud for significant growth. Furthermore, advances in AI agents and developments from Waymo in cities like Atlanta and Austin bolster the company\u2019s prospective success.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nFollowing its rank as the third top-performing stock in the S&P 500, Nvidia showcased a 171% increase in 2024. The ongoing demand for Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell GPUs underscores its robust growth trajectory. The company\u2019s strategic annual rollouts promise continued innovation, with upcoming product releases poised to enhance performance and sustain growth through 2025.\n\n3. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nDespite a challenging 2024 that saw an 18% decline, AMD is poised for recovery. The company recorded impressive revenues, and demand for its AI-focused chips remains strong, particularly within data centers. AMD\u2019s forward-looking valuation is highly attractive, with a low PEG ratio, making it a competitive option with promising growth potential in the AI sector.\n\nWith these three companies positioned for growth, investors have compelling alternatives to Palantir in the AI space for 2025.\n\nThe Future of AI Stocks: Why Alphabet, Nvidia, and AMD Could Outshine Palantir in 2025\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of AI technology, savvy investors are always on the lookout for stocks with the potential to outperform the market. While Palantir Technologies has been a popular choice, particularly with its recent addition to the S&P 500, 2025 might see other AI players taking the lead. Let\u2019s explore why Alphabet, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are top contenders for substantial growth in the coming year.\n\nPros and Insights: Alphabet\u2019s Strategic AI Positioning\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, not only enjoyed a 36% stock increase last year but also presents a compelling investment case for 2025. Its reasonable forward earnings multiple of 21 offers a more attractive valuation compared to Palantir.\n\nOne of Alphabet\u2019s key strengths lies in its burgeoning Google Cloud services, which are in high demand as businesses increasingly embrace AI-driven solutions. Moreover, innovations in AI agents and the progress of Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving technology division, in cities such as Atlanta and Austin, highlight its commitment to future tech advancements.\n\nFor more insights into Alphabet\u2019s diversified portfolio and strategic initiatives, visit the Alphabet website.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Continuous Innovation in AI Hardware\n\nNvidia remains a standout performer in the stock market, evidenced by its impressive 171% rise in 2024. This upward trajectory is largely attributed to the demand for its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, which are crucial for AI applications.\n\nNvidia\u2019s strategy of rolling out new products annually ensures a steady stream of innovation and performance enhancement. These factors position it favorably for ongoing growth in 2025, as AI technology continues to develop at a rapid pace.\n\nTo learn more about Nvidia\u2019s groundbreaking technologies, visit the Nvidia website.\n\nAMD\u2019s Comeback Potential in the AI Chip Market\n\nDespite an 18% decline last year, AMD is gearing up for a strong recovery. The company\u2019s impressive revenue figures and sustained demand for its AI-focused chips, particularly in data centers, suggest a promising year ahead.\n\nAMD\u2019s low PEG ratio enhances its appeal as a cost-effective investment in the AI industry. This financial metric indicates a potential undervaluation, making AMD a competitive option for investors seeking growth opportunities.\n\nFor further details on AMD\u2019s innovative products and future releases, visit the AMD website.\n\nMarket Analysis: Why Diversification is Key\n\nInvestors weighing their options in the AI sector for 2025 should consider the diverse strengths of these companies. While Palantir offers a compelling narrative, the strategic positioning, product innovation, and financial metrics of Alphabet, Nvidia, and AMD present equally, if not more, promising growth prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, the AI landscape is rich with opportunities. While Palantir has had its moment in the spotlight, these three companies provide viable alternatives that may very well deliver superior returns in the coming year. For investors keen on capitalizing on AI trends, keeping an eye on Alphabet, Nvidia, and AMD is a wise move.",

            "content": "Investors' growing focus on valuations could propel other stocks forward.\n\n\n\n1. AI Agents: The Next Big Trend The AI boom will continue into 2025, with AI agents likely becoming a key trend. These are AI systems that autonomously decide the best course of action, a step beyond the traditional models that only follow instructions. This development could revolutionize industries, especially for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), which offers a vast array of products, from Google Cloud to Android, that can integrate AI agents. Alphabet's launch of Google Agentspace using its Gemini large language model could position it as a leader in this space.\n\n2. Stubborn Inflation Could Lead to Market Stress While inflation has come down since its post-pandemic peak, it\u2019s expected to remain persistently high in 2025. This could disrupt the broader market, especially with the Federal Reserve showing signs of fewer rate cuts. Still, some stocks, like Costco Wholesale (COST), could thrive. Costco has already outperformed the S&P 500 during inflationary periods, and if prices stay elevated, more consumers may turn to Costco, further boosting the stock's performance.\n\n3. The Rise of Value Stocks: After a period of soaring stock prices, investors are expected to shift their attention to valuations in 2025. Value stocks, which trade at lower multiples, may become more attractive. BioNTech (BNTX), for instance, has a low price-to-earnings ratio, making it one of the best value picks. The biotech company continues to generate revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine and has a promising pipeline, all while being undervalued compared to its growth potential.\n\n4. Deregulation Will Benefit Financial Stocks: With the prospect of a more deregulated environment under the incoming Trump administration, the financial sector stands to gain. Citigroup (C) could be a standout in this context. Despite its strong 2024 performance, Citigroup's stock remains attractively priced, and deregulation could fuel further momentum. This is one stock that may continue to benefit from a more favorable regulatory landscape.\n\n5. Energy Stocks: Impact of Increased Drilling The energy sector will face a mixed impact due to deregulation, particularly with the potential increase in domestic oil production. While the increased drilling could boost some energy stocks, it may lead to a drop in oil prices, affecting earnings. However, companies like Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), which operates extensive pipelines across the U.S., are well-positioned. More drilling will result in more oil and gas flowing through these pipelines, which could strengthen Enterprise's performance, regardless of fluctuating oil prices. Additionally, its generous dividend yield makes it an attractive choice for income investors.\n\nShould You Invest in Enterprise Products Partners Right Now? Despite strong performance, Enterprise Products Partners was not included in the list of the 10 best stocks for 2025 by The Motley Fool. However, its track record of increasing distributions for 26 consecutive years, coupled with a high dividend yield, makes it a solid choice for those looking to add income-producing stocks to their portfolios.\n\n2025 looks set to be an exciting year for stock market investors, with AI, inflation, valuations, deregulation, and energy all playing a significant role in shaping the market. Stocks like Alphabet, Costco, BioNTech, Citigroup, and Enterprise Products Partners are poised to benefit if these predictions come true.\n\nDisclaimer: Always Seek Advice from a Financial Expert Before Making Any Investment Decisions",

            "content": "Alphabet Inc., the tech giant parent company of Google, continues to redefine the landscape of technology stock investments on the NASDAQ. As technology advances, Alphabet remains a pivotal player alongside other tech behemoths. However, it\u2019s Alphabet\u2019s bold steps into uncharted territories that are capturing investor attention and could revolutionize the NASDAQ.\n\nInnovation is at the core of Alphabet\u2019s strategy. As the company delves deeper into artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge technologies, its trajectory on the NASDAQ is a subject of keen interest. Recent developments, such as partnerships with leading AI firms and innovative quantum research breakthroughs, hint at a future where Alphabet is not just leading but pioneering in tech markets.\n\nWhat makes Alphabet a unique investment asset on the NASDAQ? It\u2019s the blend of traditional technological investments tied to Google and the potential high-risk, high-reward nature of its ventures in newer tech domains like autonomous driving and smart home technologies. These explorations offer both potential risks and unprecedented opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with tech stocks.\n\nWith Alphabet\u2019s constant evolution, the key question is whether these ventures will continue to pay off. As investors monitor these innovations and their impacts on the NASDAQ, the narrative of Alphabet as not just a tech leader but a visionary force for future technologies continues to unfold, offering a glimpse at the seismic shifts that could redefine tech investments.\n\nThe Untold Impact of Alphabet\u2019s Foray into Quantum Computing and AI on Humanity\n\nAs Alphabet Inc. forges ahead in groundbreaking technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, it\u2019s not just investors who should pay attention. These advances have the potential to reshape how we live and interact with technology altogether.\n\nHow could Alphabet\u2019s quantum computing advancements affect everyday life?

            "content": "The quantum computing landscape is rapidly evolving as major tech giants pour resources into this transformative technology. D-Wave Quantum Inc.(NYSE: QBTS) has emerged as a standout player in this space, with its share price reflecting tremendous investor optimism over the past year. The stock has surged an eye-catching 992% over the last 12 months, making it one of the best performing stocks of 2024.\n\nThis remarkable performance comes as quantum computing gains mainstream attention. Technology heavyweights like Alphabet and Amazon have made significant strides with their respective quantum initiatives, including Alphabet's Willow chip architecture and Amazon's Quantum Embark initiative. The enthusiasm surrounding these developments has created a ripple effect throughout the space, leaving investors wondering if D-Wave represents a viable long-term investment opportunity.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nArmed with this brief background, let's examine D-Wave's core value proposition and risk factors to understand if its shares still represent a compelling buying opportunity early in 2025.\n\nA technological pioneer pushing boundaries\n\nD-Wave has achieved several notable milestones in its pursuit of quantum computing advancement. The company recently completed calibration of its 4,400-qubit Advantage2 processor, which demonstrates remarkable performance gains over its predecessor. The new system solves complex 3D lattice problems 25,000 times faster than the current Advantage processor and delivers five-times-better solutions for high-precision computations.\n\nThe company has also secured strategic partnerships across various sectors. Recent collaborations include work with NTT DOCOMO for mobile-network optimization and Japan Tobacco Inc. for drug-discovery applications. These real-world implementations demonstrate the practical potential of D-Wave's quantum solutions.\n\nThe company's technological achievements extend beyond hardware developments. D-Wave has introduced industry-first service-level agreements for its Leap quantum cloud service, positioning itself as the only quantum computing company providing formal service-level agreements. This move underscores the company's confidence in its platform reliability.\n\nGrowing institutional confidence amid valuation concerns\n\nMajor financial institutions have shown increasing interest in D-Wave. Following substantial fourth-quarter 2024 buying activity from major investment funds, the company's institutional ownership has reached 55.4%.This substantial institutional ownership, particularly notable for a pre-profit quantum computing company, suggests strong institutional confidence in D-Wave's long-term potential.\n\nDespite this fairly strong institutional backing, the current valuation presents a significant consideration for potential investors. The stock trades at more than 172 times the projected 2025 revenue. This ultrapremium valuation reflects both market optimism and substantial growth expectations for the quantum computing industry as a whole.\n\nD-Wave's hefty valuation suggests investors should carefully consider their entry strategy. The company's recent completion of a $175 million equity offering provides substantial working capital but also underscores the risk of potential shareholder dilution in the years ahead.\n\nRevenue growth and market penetration strategy\n\nRecent financial results reveal the early-stage nature of D-Wave's business model. The company's core quantum computing service revenue grew 41% year over year in Q3 2024, highlighting the increasing adoption of its platform. However, total revenue declined 27% to $1.9 million due to timing variations in professional services contracts.\n\nThis revenue-mix shift aligns with the company's strategic focus on recurring quantum computing services. D-Wave has prioritized expanding its quantum-as-a-service platform, which provides more predictable long-term revenue compared to project-based professional services engagements.\n\nThe company's market-expansion efforts target both commercial and government sectors. D-Wave recently secured \"awardable\" status on the U.S. Department of Defense's Tradewinds buying platform, opening access to significant government-procurement opportunities. The company has also established partnerships with the Chicago Quantum Exchange and regional technology companies to accelerate quantum computing adoption across different markets.\n\nThese expansion efforts are grounded in practical applications that demonstrate clear business value. D-Wave's quantum computing solutions have shown measurable benefits in network optimization, reducing infrastructure costs for telecommunications companies. The platform has also accelerated drug-discovery processes through quantum-assisted molecular modeling, proving its utility in pharmaceutical research.\n\nA strategic approach to investing in this nascent tech\n\nGiven the stock's significant run-up and rich valuation, investors might consider a more measured approach to building a position. One possible strategy involves selling cash-secured puts at strike prices below the current market value. This approach allows investors to potentially acquire shares at lower prices while earning premium income.\n\nFor example, investors could sell out-of-the-money puts with strike prices that align with their desired entry points. If the stock maintains its upward trajectory, the premium income provides a return while investors wait for a better entry opportunity. If the stock declines to the strike price, investors can acquire shares at a more favorable valuation.\n\nThis options strategy requires careful position sizing and risk management. Investors should only secure puts with cash they're willing to use for share purchases, ensuring they can take ownership of the stock if it falls to their target price.\n\nThe verdict\n\nD-Wave operates in a market with extraordinary potential where a functional quantum computer could revolutionize diverse industries from healthcare to artificial intelligence (AI). Moreover, the company has significantly progressed in developing its platform and secured meaningful partnerships. However, the stock's current valuation demands a thoughtful, position-building approach.\n\nFor investors intrigued by quantum computing's long-term potential, D-Wave presents an opportunity to gain exposure to this emerging technology. However, the quantum computing market's high valuation and early-stage nature suggest a disciplined, strategic approach to building a position may be the prudent course of action.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in D-Wave Quantum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and D-Wave Quantum wasn\u2019t one of them.

Learn More\n\nThis article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nAlphabet made headlines toward the end of 2024, with its CEO telling employees to be ready for an important 2025 while also warning that it would be a challenging year.\n\nWhile it may be a challenging year for the company, this could be the setup for a strong year for its stock.\n\nLet's take a look at what CEO Sundar Pichai had to say about 2025 based on a report from CNBC and why his comments could be good for the stock.\n\n2025 will be a critical year for Alphabet\n\nAt its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Pichai addressed employees and explained why 2025 would be a critical year for Alphabet. He noted that the stakes were high with artificial intelligence (AI) and that the company as a whole needed to move faster. He called this a disruptive moment and said that Alphabet needed to be able to use AI to help solve real-world problems.\n\nAt the same time, Pichai acknowledged the regulatory pressure the company was under. In 2024, Alphabet lost an antitrust case brought on by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which ruled that it had a search monopoly.\n\nAs a remedy, the DOJ has asked the court to force the company to divest its Chrome browser and even potentially its Android phone operating system, as well as share user and advertiser data. Meanwhile, the DOJ just concluded another case against the company for dominating online ad technology, and the United Kingdom has also announced its objections to Alphabet's ad technology practices.\n\nFocus on AI innovation\n\nPichai, however, said that this came with the territory, given the company's size, and that it must not get distracted. The company's focus for 2025 will clearly be on AI. The CEO displayed a chart showing how its Gemini 1.5 large language model (LLM) is currently in the lead versus competitors, including ChatGPT, while also predicting that there will be a lot of back-and-forth between which models are the best.\n\nOne area where Alphabet appears to have taken a clear lead is in video AI. The company's Veo 2 AI video generator has received rave reviews and is widely considered to greatly outperform OpenAI's Sora video generator, which came out just a few weeks before Veo 2. Veo 2 was trained using Alphabet's YouTube video platform, which could account for its advantages.\n\nGemini 2.0, Alphabet's newest generation AI LLM, meanwhile, will be incorporated throughout the company's products in 2025. Alphabet is also looking to push its Gemini app, which is not currently as popular as ChatGPT.\n\nThe company has seen some strong momentum in the past few months, but it is playing catch-up, as ChatGPT has become synonymous with AI after bursting onto the scene a few years ago. Pichai said, \"Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\"\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy?\n\nAlphabet has sometimes been viewed as bloated and living off its laurels. However, the competitive threat and opportunity with AI have appeared to reinvigorate the company and its innovative juices. Pichai said several times that the company needed to be \"scrappy.\" While competition can be viewed as a bad thing, sometimes it is needed to make a company start picking up its game.\n\nAlphabet appears to be doing just that. This can be seen in its recent breakthrough in quantum computing, as well as with Veo 2. Right now, competition is bringing the best out of the company. And while Veo 2 is superior due to being trained on YouTube, I could see Google's decades of search data being a key differentiator in any future AI search battles.\n\nMeanwhile, I think AI Search Overviews and the Gemini App should eventually lead to new forms of ad monetisation. Currently, Google only monetizes about 20% of its searches, so new AI queries could be a big revenue growth driver at some point in the future.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Alphabet is one of the cheaper mega-cap tech stocks involved in AI, trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 21.5 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nWith Alphabet looking focused and ready for the challenges of 2025, I'd buy the stock at current levels. The company is showing its innovation prowess, which I think should help endear the stock to investors.\n\nAt the same time, I find its valuation very attractive with a lot of room for expanding its P/E multiple.\n\nThis article was originally published on Fool.com.

            "content": "META released its latest model of Llama Large Language Model (LLM) and it has forced both Google and Amazon to rethink their LLM strategy. The new Llama 3.3 70B model outperforms Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-40 and Amazon\u2019s Nova Pro on various benchmarks. Despite this outperformance, both Google and Amazon stocks showed little signs of distress.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why those two peers took no notice of Meta\u2019s progress. Google recently released Gemini 2.0 LLM. The early version of this model is two times faster than the current Gemini 1.5 Pro. The 2.0 version also features text-to-speech and image-generation capabilities. However, these features aren\u2019t yet available to the general public.\n\nWhy You Should Buy Alphabet Stock\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini 2.0 is also trained to utilize tools, which means it would be an integral part of the company\u2019s progress on agentic AI. For those who don\u2019t know, agentic AI is the automation of AI itself. Currently, users have to input data to Google Gemini to receive an AI-powered response. Agentic AI systems will be able to decide for themselves when to initiate a task, when to finish it, and how to go about making these decisions. In short, it is autonomous AI.\n\nGoogle is also experiencing tailwinds on the back of its Willow quantum computing chip introduced last month. The chip is expected to revolutionize how quantum computing works, even though practical applications are still unclear.\n\nQuantum computing works on the basis of qubits: bits that can have an on-and-off state at the same time. Increasing the number of qubits in a system increases the likelihood of errors. However, the Willow chips work the other way around and reduce the chances of error as more qubits are added to the system. On the back of this success, the stock was unlikely to face any selling pressure just because Meta introduced a more powerful LLM.\n\nIt must also be considered that training LLMs is not the highest priority for analysts right now. Wall Street now wants to see what these models are capable of delivering. Everyone has their eye set on autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, and AI agents. Analysts want companies to deliver on their AI investments and stop the mad dash to train better models. Any company coming up with a more powerful Large Language Model is unlikely to generate any excitement. It's now all about AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms is 3rd on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 235 hedge fund portfolios held META at the end of the third quarter which was 219 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of META as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "We came across a long thesis on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on ValueInvestorsClub by natey1015. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on GOOGL. The company\u2019s shares were trading at $157.46 when this thesis was published, vs. closing price of $189.43 on Jan 2nd.\n\n\u00a9 https://beconnected.esafety.gov.au/\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company that wholly owns the internet giant Google. The company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from advertising sales on the Google platform. Alongside online ads, the company generates subscription services from YouTube, platforms like PlayStore, and devices such as Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and others.\n\nThe bull thesis relies on the premise that GOOGL has historically been chronically undervalued, despite achieving higher growth than many Big Tech names. The author argues that markets have consistently discounted the company due to perceived cyclicality and competitive threats, including the transition from desktop to mobile, competition from Apple\u2019s ecosystem, and pressures from Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice search \u2013 threats that ultimately did not materialize. Additionally, the market has underestimated the total addressable market (TAM) of GOOGL, wrongly assuming that online advertising had a ceiling. In reality, GOOGL created incremental TAM for itself by redefining online advertising.\n\nThe author views the company as a bet on societal productivity improvements, emphasizing its tremendous optionality across scalable opportunities such as Waymo, AI/Gemini, and other products. Furthermore, the author believes the threats currently leading to GOOGL\u2019s market discount are unlikely to materialize. The most notable concern is that AI might cannibalize internet search market share; however, the author contends that AI capabilities are more likely to complement, rather than replace, traditional search. Furthermore, GOOGL has made tremendous progress in AI through its own Gemini product.\n\nAlthough the author does not provide a precise stock price target for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), he highlights the implied market valuation of the Google Search business. The business is valued at only 10x FY2025 after-tax earnings, while its closest peer, Meta\u2019s social media business, trades at more than twice that multiple. Consequently, the author concludes that GOOGL\u2019s chronic undervaluation represents an opportunity to invest in a high-quality compounder at an attractive price, with significant optionality that could yield substantial returns.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

But the core internet search business is still top of mind for Google stock amid the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, ongoing antitrust lawsuits pursued by the Department of Justice hang over GOOGL stock.\n\nFourth quarter and full year earnings for Alphabet stock are due Feb. 4. Wall Street analysts project EPS growth of 29% to $2.12 with revenue growing 12% to $96.7 billion.\n\nAlso, Google's internet search advertising is expected to climb 11% to $53.29 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet. YouTube ad revenue will grow 11% to $10.24 billion, analysts predict. Meanwhile, cloud computing revenue is expected to grow 32% to $12.1 billion.\n\nAlphabet's new Chief Financial Officer, Anat Ashkenazi, is expected to lay out more of her priorities on the Q4 earnings call with analysts.\n\nMeta Platform's Q4 results may bode well for Alphabet stock, said Bank of America analyst Justin Post in a report.\n\n\"We see Meta's Q4 ad revenue beat and e-commerce vertical commentary as positive read across for Google Q4 results,\" he said in a report. \"A channel check also indicated AI overview ads aided search pricing. We recently lowered our estimates for recent U.S. dollar appreciation, but with Meta not seeing a Q4 currency exchange rate impact and e-commerce ad spend strength, we think Google can beat street Q4 estimates.\"\n\nGoogle Stock: Innovation Leader\n\nWhether the internet giant is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nAlso, Google stock belongs to the IBD Leaderboard. But Alphabet continues to under-perform some Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nGOOGL stock popped 37% in 2024, though it pulled back from a high of 201.42 set on Dec. 17. So far in 2025, GOOGL stock has advanced 8%.\n\nIn 2025, analysts predict Google search advertising growth of nearly 10% to $216.5 billion.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said over 25% of new Google code is generated by artificial intelligence. Google's increasing reliance on AI tools for software development begs the question of whether workforce reductions will follow.\n\nGoogle Stock: Search Business Threatened\n\nGenerative AI startup OpenAI's ChatGPT continues to slowly gain market share. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries while Google's business model has been based on providing web links. Also, startup Perplexity is another new rival. Perplexity is seeking a merger with TikTok.\n\nGoogle is competing with OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and many others in building new foundation models. In December, Google unveiled its new artificial intelligence model, Gemini 2.0.\n\nGoogle began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. In late October, Google launched AI Overviews in 100 countries\n\nThe AI Overviews system uses Google's in-house Gemini AI model. Advertisers utilizing Gemini AI tools see increased traffic and click-through rates, especially among younger demographics, Google says.\n\nIn December, Google announced the Willow quantum computing chip. Google has been a leader in quantum research. But quantum technology faces challenges.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Waymo Expands\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo on Dec. 5 announced that the company plans to expand its autonomous vehicle rideshare service to Miami in 2026. The Waymo One robotaxi service currently operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with upcoming service already planned for Austin, Tex. and Atlanta. In Miami, Waymo will compete with Uber Technologies and other rideshare services. In Austin and Atlanta, Waymo is partnering with Uber.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo also disclosed that it has reached 150,000 trips per week, rapid growth from August levels at 100,00 per week. Waymo is widely viewed as the leader in autonomous vehicles. In October, Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round, including Google and previous investors. If Wall Street analysts start including Waymo in Alphabet's valuation, it would be a big development.\n\nHowever, legal woes continue amid DoJ antitrust cases. Both Google's internet search and advertising businesses are under DoJ scrutiny.\n\nGoogle Stock: YouTube, TikTok\n\nAlso, analysts say GOOGL stock is getting a boost from the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory.\n\nAside from Google's core internet search advertising business, Wall Street analysts view growth at YouTube and cloud computing as key. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business, where it's battling Apple in smartphones.\n\nGoogle aims to slow down the growth of TikTok with its own short video platform. How much money Google generates from YouTube Shorts is a key issue for 2024, analysts say. YouTube Shorts now generates roughly 70 billion daily views.\n\nIn cloud computing, Google is still the third biggest service provider, behind Amazon.com and Microsoft. Like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft' Azure business, Google's cloud unit has upped capital spending targeting the new opportunity in generative AI.\n\nGoogle's 2022 acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion seems to be paying dividends. Mandiant is part of Google's cloud-based cybersecurity services.\n\nGOOGL Stock: Is It A Buy Or Sell Now?\n\nAlphabet stock has turned in good and bad years recently. Shares jumped 65% in 2021 but in 2022 dropped 39%. Despite mounting competition in AI and internet search, Alphabet advanced 58% in 2023.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Rating of Google stock currently stands at 85 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.\n\nGoogle stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.\n\nFurther, shares hold an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nOn MarketSurge, GOOGL stock trades above a buy zone. And, long-time holders could take profits.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.",

This service let users find detailed satellite images of most locations on Earth and also create combinations (known as \u201cmashups\u201d) with various other databases, incorporating details such as street names, weather patterns, crime statistics, coffee shop locations, real-estate prices, and population densities into maps created by Google Earth. While many of these mashups were created for convenience or simple novelty, others became critical lifesaving tools. For instance, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Google Earth provided interactive satellite overlays of the affected region, enabling rescuers to better understand the extent of the damage. Subsequently, Google Earth became a vital tool in many disaster recovery efforts. In 2005, concurrent with Google Earth\u2019s inception, Google Maps was also born. Google Maps began as a desktop tool for geographical navigation, then evolved into a GPS-based navigational app that provided real-time, turn-by-turn directions and was accessible via mobile devices. Although Google Earth and Google Maps were conceived as separate projects, their parallel development relied on shared technologies, a key principle that would later become the foundation of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet Inc., a multi-subsidiary operation.\n\nPrivacy issues concerning Street View Google\u2019s privacy policies were scrutinized upon launching its Street View function, which provided a 360-degree panoramic view of a given location and allowed a user to virtually \u201ctravel\u201d on a street level from one location to the next. The Street View functionality was accessible on both Google Earth and Google Maps. The primary privacy concern was that Street View included images of people and house interiors visible from the street. In response to these worries, Google implemented a policy of automatically blurring faces and license plates. In addition, users can request blurring of their cars, homes, people, or any images violating their privacy or that they deem inappropriate (like nudity or violence).\n\nOpen full sized image The G1 smartphone, based on Google's Android operating system, displayed in 2008. \u00a9 Michael Oryl (CC BY-SA 2.0)\n\nIn 2010 Google entered into direct competition with Apple\u2019s iPhone by introducing the Nexus One smartphone. Nicknamed the \u201cGoogle Phone,\u201d the Nexus One used the latest version of Android and featured a large, vibrant display screen, aesthetically pleasing design, and a voice-to-text messaging system that was based on advanced voice-recognition software. However, its lack of native support for multi-touch\u2014a typing and navigation feature pioneered by Apple that allowed users more flexibility in interacting with touchscreens\u2014was seen as a drawback when compared with other handsets in its class. Despite Android\u2019s perceived drawbacks compared with Apple\u2019s smartphone iOS, by the end of 2011, Android led the mobile phone industry with a 52% global market share, more than triple that of iOS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to destroy Android, because it\u2019s a stolen product. I\u2019m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.\u201d \u2014Apple cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs on alleged patent violations.\n\nIn 2010 Google\u2019s hardware partners also began releasing tablet computers based on the Android operating system. The first product was criticized for poor performance, but by the end of 2011 Android-based tablets had gained ground on the hugely popular Apple iPad. Of the 68 million tablets estimated to have shipped in that year, 39% ran Android, compared with nearly 60% being iPads. Google was obliged to battle competitors over Android in the courts as well as in the marketplace. In 2010, for example, Oracle Corporation sued Google for $6.1 billion in damages, claiming Android had violated numerous patents relating to Oracle\u2019s Java programming language. (After two years in court, Google eventually won the lawsuit.) Instead of attacking Google directly, Apple sued makers of Android smartphones, such as HTC, Motorola Mobility, and Samsung, over alleged patent violations. Apple CEO Steve Jobs was said to have claimed, \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy Android, because it\u2019s a stolen product. I\u2019m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.\u201d The patent wars over mobile operating systems seemed unresolvable, as suits and countersuits were filed with each release of a new version. But, as of 2023, Android held a 70.8% market share among smartphones, with Apple holding the second spot at 28.4%. Social networks and Google+ Google was late to recognize the popularity and advertising potential of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Its first attempt to create a social network, Google Buzz, started in 2010 and closed less than two years later. Among several problems, the network was limited to users who had Gmail accounts, and it created privacy issues by featuring a default setting that showed a user\u2019s profile to anyone. Even before Google Buzz had shut down, the company launched Google+ in June 2011, at first to a limited audience and then to anyone. Within a year of its start, the social network service had attracted more than 170 million users. Facebook, by contrast, had taken five years to reach 150 million users. Nevertheless, Google+ faced a formidable competitor in Facebook, which by mid-2012 had some 900 million users. Facebook users spent far more time on their site, clocking six to seven hours per month, while Google+ users averaged a little more than three minutes per month. Because Facebook did not permit Google\u2019s Web indexing software to penetrate its servers, Google was unable to include the giant social network in its search results, thus losing potentially valuable data from one of the most-trafficked networks on the Internet. Still, the company appeared to be fully supportive of Google+. Seeing the value of games in retaining users on social networks, it quickly released a games area for the service. It also developed innovative features that were not available on Facebook. For example, with Hangouts, users could instantly create free video conferences for up to 10 people. The company also added Google+ pages for businesses to market their products and brands. However, Google+ never supplanted Facebook, and the service was discontinued in 2019. Google becomes an Alphabet subsidiary In August 2015, Google was reorganized into a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc. Internet search, advertising, apps, and maps, as well as the mobile operating system Android and the video-sharing site YouTube, remained under Google. Separate Google ventures\u2014such as longevity research company Calico, home-products company Nest, and research lab Google X\u2014became separate firms under Alphabet. Page became CEO of Alphabet, Brin its president, and Schmidt its executive chairman. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products, became Google\u2019s new CEO.\n\nOpen full sized image Parent company and golden child. \u00a9 Avishek Das\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Image\n\nThe creation of Alphabet as the holding company was intended to foster technological innovation across multiple industries and sectors, and allow company segments to pursue new opportunities with the support of shared resources and cooperation. Alphabet again reorganized in 2017 to create an intermediate holding company, XXVI Holdings, and to convert Google into a limited liability company (LLC). In 2018 Schmidt stepped down as executive chairman. More changes followed in 2019 as both Brin and Page left their posts as president and CEO, respectively. However, they both remained on Alphabet\u2019s board of directors. Pichai became CEO of the holding company while retaining that position at Google. Controversies In 2021 Google and e-commerce company Amazon signed a contract, Project Nimbus, that would provide the Israeli military with access to artificial intelligence services and cloud computing powered by both technology giants. After the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, many experts criticized Israel for perpetrated a genocide against Palestinian civilians residing in the Gaza strip. Google employees organized against Project Nimbus starting in 2021, the same year a report by The Intercept found that Google\u2019s machine learning and AI tools could potentially be aiding the Israeli government in perpetrating war crimes and human rights abuses. Multiple employees were fired that year for speaking out against the project. In April 2024 employees staged sit-ins protesting Nimbus, leading to almost 50 employees being fired. Nine other employees were arrested. Pichai released a statement about the firings, stating that Google was a \u201cbusiness, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe\u2026This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.\u201d\n\nReferences",

            "content": "In the past year, U.S. tech stocks have once again become the focus of global investors.\n\nWith a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion, Broadcom has officially joined the ranks of tech giants, expanding the club of large tech stocks to eight: Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, and Broadcom\u2014these eight stocks are collectively referred to as \"BATMMAAN.\"\n\nNotably, among BATMMAAN, NVIDIA, which has the highest return rate, may currently have the lowest valuation.\n\nData shows that NVIDIA recorded a 171% increase in 2024, the largest among the eight stocks in BATMMAAN. Meanwhile, based on the closing price in 2024, NVIDIA's expected price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 31 times, while analysts generally expect NVIDIA's earnings to grow by 52% in 2025, resulting in a PEG ratio of 0.6.\n\nThe PEG metric was invented by investment master Jim Slater in the 1960s, referring to the company's expected P/E ratio divided by the expected earnings growth rate. If the PEG is greater than 1, the stock may be overvalued; conversely, it may be undervalued.\n\nAmong BATMMAAN, only NVIDIA has a PEG ratio below 1. This means that NVIDIA's valuation remains reasonable, making it the \"cheapest\" among large tech stocks. Broadcom ranks second lowest with a level of 2.3.\n\nIn comparison, although Tesla's expected earnings growth rate for next year is also 37%, its expected P/E ratio is as high as 121 times, pushing the PEG to 3.2, making it the highest in BATMMAAN.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft recorded only a 12% cumulative increase in 2024, making it the only stock in BATMMAAN to underperform the market, with a PEG of 2.3, indicating overvaluation. The other two companies with low earnings growth rates are Alphabet and Meta, with PEG ratios of 1.8 and 1.9, respectively, while Apple and Amazon have PEGs of 1.8 and 1.4, respectively.\n\nIt is important to note that high valuations do not necessarily mean poor performance in the short term. Looking back at history, as we entered 1999 from 1998, despite many analysts warning that stock market valuations were too high, the S&P 500 index still rose by 21% in 1999",

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOG -2.71%) (GOOGL -2.65%) had a solid 2024, with the stock up over 40% as of the time of writing. With that kind of performance, it would be understandable if investors thought it couldn't have a great 2025. However, I don't think that's the case.\n\nThis tech giant has several strong tailwinds, and those winds aren't set to subside anytime soon (and certainly not in 2025). Furthermore, the stock is attractively priced, making Alphabet a great stock to consider heading into the new year.\n\nAlphabet's advertising business supports other investments\n\nAlphabet does many things, but its primary business is still advertising through the Google search engine. In the third quarter, 56% of revenue came from the Google Search division, and that segment experienced 12% year-over-year revenue growth. Considering how mature this business segment is, that's highly respectable growth.\n\nHaving a rock-solid base segment like the search business allows Alphabet to invest its massive cash flows into other areas of its business. One area that has received a lot of attention lately is artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. Alphabet has one of the top models in the space: Google Gemini.\n\nGemini usage has rapidly increased. Management states that its enterprise AI platform, Vertex, has seen Gemini usage increase 14 times in a six-month period. That's a massive figure and shows how Gemini is starting to become integrated into various clients' operations.\n\nMost of this usage occurs through its cloud computing division, Google Cloud. While the cloud computing industry is benefiting as a whole amid the AI arms race, the general migration from on-site computing to cloud computing is still occurring. This dual effect is causing Google Cloud's revenue to rise rapidly, as revenue increased by 35% in Q3. That's far quicker than the 29% and 28% growth it experienced in Q2 and Q1, respectively.\n\nOverall, Alphabet's business is doing great and is poised for another strong 2025, as Wall Street analysts project 12% revenue and earnings growth. While that's not flashy growth like some of its big tech peers are putting up, it's enough to surpass the broader market's long-term growth rate.\n\nBut there could be another catalyst that spurs Alphabet's stock higher in 2025.\n\nAlphabet's stock isn't that expensive compared to its peers\n\nAlphabet's valuation is best compared to its big tech siblings, which are often grouped into the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Alphabet is the cheapest stock in terms of both the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and the forward P/E ratio.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet doesn't hold much of a premium to the broader market, either. The S&P 500 trades for 25.2 times trailing earnings and 21.9 times forward earnings. So, compared to the broader market, Alphabet holds a reasonable price tag.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind, I think Alphabet is a stock that can beat the market next year; just don't expect it to blow Wall Street out of the water. The growth trends Alphabet is experiencing in the AI realm aren't going to subside anytime soon, and it will be a key investment area for many years. Although Alphabet had a solid 2024, I think 2025 will be another successful year for its investors.",

The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.22%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.36%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.16%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the internet search leader had gained 8.56% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.86%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.36%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.12, up 29.27% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $81.41 billion, indicating a 12.57% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.11% decrease. Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.23. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 22.64, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.2. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.45 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 44, placing it within the top 18% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins.\n\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a \u201cbig problem\u201d for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) \u2026. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they\u2019re not really AI plays, they\u2019re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They\u2019ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you\u2019re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that\u2019s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,\u201d Niles said.\n\nNiles said stocks can face a \u201crough\u201d time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed.\n\n\u201cThe Fed finally admitted inflation wasn\u2019t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that\u2019s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 160\n\nPaul Meeks, CIO at Harvest Portfolio Management, was recently asked during a program on CNBC whether investors should have exposure to quantum computing or if it is too early. Here is what Meeks said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just too early, it\u2019s way too early. You know, I\u2019m still hoping for some monetizable artificial intelligence use cases, and of course, that hope has yet to materialize in a lot of cases. We\u2019ll see what happens. But as far as Quantum goes, I did like the announcement from Google of the Willow chip, right? It has had some great benchmarking, technically speaking. But we are talking about a theme that is not just a couple years away but probably a lot longer than that. So I own Google, but I own Google for other reasons. This is just icing on the cake. But these Quantum Computing pure plays, I think that they\u2019re probably setting themselves up for better short candidates than long candidates.\u201d\n\nThe market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79\u2014a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google\u2019s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader.\n\nWhat are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August.\n\nThis growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day\u2014substantially higher than Uber\u2019s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber\u2019s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo\u2019s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing.\n\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit\u2014a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment\u2019s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): Google was our top detractor in the third quarter despite reporting second quarter results that were generally in line with expectations. The company reported slightly better revenue growth in Search, which grew 14% and continues to be resilient in the face of AI challengers, and Google Cloud, which grew 29% in the quarter. Service operating income margins of 40% and Cloud operating income margins of 11% were also both ahead of investors\u2019 expectations as management\u2019s cost-efficiency efforts drove operating leverage. YouTube revenue growth was slightly below expectations (+13% v. +16%) driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons and some general weakness in the Brand Advertising vertical. Finally, Cap Ex in the quarter of $13.2 billion was more than expected and likely the driver of the weakness in the stock as investors grapple with how much infrastructure investment will be required to achieve Google\u2019s AI goals. With its high margin business model (44% EBITDA margins last quarter), continued strength across its core Search and YouTube franchises, and continued growth and expanding profitability in its still relatively small Cloud business, we continue to view Alphabet as among the best-positioned secular growth franchises in the market. Additionally, GOOG shares trade at a compelling 19.5x the Street\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate, a discount to the Russell 1000 Growth Index.\u201d\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 4th on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%) (GOOG -2.71%) made headlines toward the end of 2024, with its CEO telling its employees to be ready for an important 2025 while also warning that it would be a challenging year. While it may be a challenging year for the company, this could be the setup for a strong year for its stock.\n\nLet's take a look at what CEO Sundar Pichai had to say about 2025 based on a report from CNBC and why his comments could be good for the stock.\n\n2025 will be a critical year for Alphabet\n\nAt its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Pichai laid out why 2025 will be a critical year for Alphabet as he addressed employees. He noted that the stakes were high with artificial intelligence (AI) and that the company as a whole needed to move faster. He called this a disruptive moment and said that Alphabet needed to be able to use AI to help solve real-world problems.\n\nAt the same time, Pichai acknowledged the regulatory pressure the company was under. In 2024, Alphabet lost an antitrust case brought on by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which ruled that it had a search monopoly. As a remedy, the DOJ has asked the court to force the company to divest its Chrome browser and even potentially its Android phone operating system, as well as share user and advertiser data. Meanwhile, the DOJ just concluded another case against the company for dominating online ad technology, and the U.K. has also announced its objections over Alphabet's ad technology practices.\n\nPichai, however, said that this comes with the territory, given the company's size, and that it must not get distracted. The company's focus for 2025 will clearly be on AI. The CEO displayed a chart showing how its Gemini 1.5 large language model (LLM) is currently in the lead versus competitors, including ChatGPT, while also predicting that there will be a lot of back-and-forth between which models are the best.\n\nOne area where Alphabet appears to have taken a clear lead is in video AI. The company's Veo 2 AI video generator has received rave reviews and is widely considered to greatly outperform OpenAI's Sora video generator, which came out just a few weeks before Veo 2. Veo 2 was trained using Alphabet's YouTube video platform, which could account for its advantages.\n\nGemini 2.0, Alphabet's newest generation AI LLM, meanwhile, will be incorporated throughout the company's products in 2025. Alphabet is also looking to push its Gemini app, which is not currently as popular as ChatGPT. The company has seen some strong momentum in the past few months, but it is playing catch-up, as ChatGPT has become synonymous with AI after bursting onto the scene a few years ago. Pichai said, \"Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\"\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy?\n\nAlphabet has sometimes been viewed as bloated and living off its laurels. However, the competitive threat and opportunity with AI have appeared to reinvigorate the company and its innovative juices. Pichai said several times that the company needed to be \"scrappy.\" While competition can be viewed as a bad thing, sometimes it is needed to make a company start picking up its game.\n\nAlphabet appears to be doing just that. This can be seen in its recent breakthrough in quantum computing, as well as with Veo 2. Right now, competition is bringing the best out of the company. And while Veo 2 is superior due to being trained on YouTube, I could see Google's decades of search data being a key differentiator in any future AI search battles.\n\nMeanwhile, I think AI Search Overviews and the Gemini App should eventually lead to new forms of ad monetization. Currently, Google only monetizes about 20% of its searches, so new AI queries could be a big revenue growth driver at some point in the future.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Alphabet is one of the cheaper mega-cap tech stocks involved in AI, trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 21.5 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nWith Alphabet looking focused and ready for the challenges of 2025, I'd be a buyer of the stock at current levels. The company is showing its innovation prowess, which I think should help endear the stock to investors. At the same time, I find its valuation very attractive with it having a lot of room for expansion of its P/E multiple.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-01, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $230.97. It's currently trading at a price of $189.3. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 18.04%. The company is modestly undervalued.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Alphabet Inc\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $7.39 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 127.59 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 133.02 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 230.97\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $136.88. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -38.3%.

            "content": "Stocks in artificial intelligence (AI) have been major contributors to market performance this year. With the AI movement still seemingly in its early stages, it\u2019s likely that these stocks will continue to propel market growth into the next year as well.\n\nHere are three AI stocks that stand out, all of which are currently trading at appealing valuations and represent intelligent investment choices at this moment.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the top beneficiary in the construction of AI infrastructure, thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs). These GPUs are essential for data centers that need to process vast amounts of computing power to train expansive language models (LLMs) and manage AI inference tasks. As AI technologies grow, the demand for computing power increases significantly. For instance, both xAI and Meta Platforms have reported using ten times the amount of GPUs for their latest LLMs compared to previous models.\n\nThis ongoing surge in computing needs, combined with the strong market position Nvidia has established through its CUDA software platform, makes it an attractive purchase. Originally developed to simplify programming its GPUs for tasks beyond video game graphics, CUDA has become the foundational platform for GPU programming, enhancing Nvidia\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nWith AI infrastructure investment expected to rise beyond 2025, Nvidia is poised for continued growth. The stock\u2019s current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 31.5 according to 2025 analysts\u2019 predictions, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio near 0.98. Generally, a PEG ratio below 1 suggests a stock may be undervalued, particularly in growth sectors where PEG ratios are typically higher.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nMany chipmakers now operate on a fabless basis, designing chips but outsourcing production. This strategy is cost-effective as building and maintaining chip manufacturing plants requires significant capital and high utilization to turn a profit. Moreover, manufacturing chips involves sophisticated technology, often needing updates to accommodate shrinking chip sizes and larger wafer dimensions.\n\nAs the demand for advanced AI chips continues to climb, the need for foundry services also increases. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, has capitalized on this demand more than any other company. It has outpaced its main competitors, Intel and Samsung, who also run their own third-party foundry businesses. TSMC\u2019s dominance in contract semiconductor manufacturing, driven by its scale and technological prowess, has been a significant growth factor.\n\nTop global chipmakers like Apple, Broadcom, and Nvidia are among TSMC\u2019s clientele. The struggles faced by its competitors have also enhanced TSMC\u2019s ability to command higher prices, which is expected to continue boosting its gross margins next year.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to maintain its lead in the AI sector, with the stock currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 23 and a PEG of 1.19.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has greatly benefited as a major player in cloud computing infrastructure, driven by the AI trend. Google Cloud\u2019s revenue surged by 35% last quarter, reaching $11.4 billion, outpacing the growth of Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This segment, which has high fixed costs, has reached a profitability milestone, with operating income jumping significantly from the previous year.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s custom AI chip, developed in collaboration with Broadcom, has been a key advantage, reducing AI inference processing times and costs. The company has also been showcasing new AI innovations like Veo 2, a next-generation video AI generator, and Whisk, an AI image generator, which have received favorable reviews.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet\u2019s latest AI model, Gemini 2, is being integrated across its product offerings, including Google Search. While there are concerns about AI impacting Google\u2019s search dominance, the company sees this as an opportunity to monetize more searches by adding new ad formats to AI-generated responses.\n\nWith a forward P/E ratio of under 22, Alphabet\u2019s stock is attractively priced, presenting a good buying opportunity given the substantial potential ahead.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

            "content": "The stock market in 2024 ended on a high note, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining 23.31% and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbing 28.64%, dispelling earlier fears of modest gains or even a recession. This unexpected surge was largely driven by tech leaders, which not only defied expectations but also set the stage for continued investment interest into 2025. According to IBD, mutual funds are once again eyeing tech stocks, but with a notable shift in focus away from familiar names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). Instead, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google (GOOG), have emerged as the top picks among fund managers.\n\nThis pivot towards TSM and Google reflects a strategic response to new market dynamics and growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. TSM, as the world\u2019s leading contract manufacturer of advanced chips, is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom, regardless of which company leads in AI development. IBD notes that the company\u2019s solid performance is reflected in its Ratings, with a Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 98, and a Relative Strength Rating of 92. The Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JARTX) has already capitalized on this potential, maintaining a significant stake in TSM. According to the latest data, TSM accounts for approximately 2.8% of the fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet\u2018s 9% stock surge this month came after the announcement of a breakthrough in quantum computing with their new Willow chip. This development not only showcases Alphabet\u2019s commitment to cutting-edge technology but also positions it as a leader in a field that could redefine computing in the coming years. The stock, which has risen by over 27% from its September low of $148.80, has drawn the attention of mutual funds seeking tech stocks with solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects.\n\nHowever, as 2025 approaches, the landscape is not without its challenges. The potential for new tariffs under the incoming Trump administration could impact certain sectors, while a cautious Federal Reserve might influence rate-sensitive areas like small caps and homebuilders. These risks require fund managers to be particularly discerning in their investments, focusing on companies with solid fundamentals and those that are pivotal in emerging tech trends.\n\nThe shift from Nvidia and Tesla to TSM and Google in mutual fund portfolios isn\u2019t just about chasing performance; it\u2019s about anticipating the next wave of technological innovation and economic policy changes. TSM\u2019s role in manufacturing chips for a broad range of tech companies ensures its relevance in any tech-driven market, while Google\u2019s advancements in quantum computing could herald a new era of computational power, affecting industries from pharmaceuticals to finance.\n\nThis strategic fund allocation indicates a nuanced understanding of market trends, where the focus isn\u2019t solely on immediate past performers but on future leaders in technology sectors that are poised to drive the next phase of economic growth. As the new year unfolds, these investments might well dictate the pace and direction of market recovery and growth, navigating through both opportunities and the looming risks of 2025.\n\nPrice Action: TSM shares closed Tuesday\u2019s session down 1.45% at $197.49. Despite this slight dip, the stock still closed the year 2024 with an impressive 90% gain. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares closed slightly down at $189.30, representing a 1% decrease. However, the stock has still seen significant gains over the past few months, with a 13.36% increase in the last 3 months and a 35.51% gain year to date.",

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares closed slightly lower on Monday.\n\nAt a strategy meeting featuring Alphabet executives, CEO Sundar Pichai addressed key 2025 topics, including artificial intelligence, competition and regulatory pressure.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d Pichai said at the Dec. 18 gathering, as reported by CNBC. \u201cI think 2025 will be critical. I think it\u2019s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment and need to move faster as a company.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 23, B of A Securities analyst Justin Post maintained Alphabet with a Buy rating and maintained a $210 price target.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Alphabet, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Alphabet offers an annual dividend yield of 0.42%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 20 cents per share (80 cents a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,434,300 or around 7,500 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $286,860 or around 1,500 shares.\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.80 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.80 = 7,500 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.80 = 1,500 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nGOOGL Price Action: Shares of Alphabet fell 0.8% to close at $191.24 on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More:\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

In the process, it\u2019s considering the growing need for personalized healthcare in treating diseases.\n\nMDT stock is down about 11.5 % in the three months ending December 30.

Stryker has a payout ratio that\u2019s more than 50% less than that of Medtronic, and its dividends have been increasing at an average annual rate of 9% in the last three years. Plus, the company has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years.\n\nSYK stock gained about 20% in 2024, including a drop of about 8% in the last month of the year.

Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon, which is also getting in on the chip game, surged more than 50%. Google parent Alphabet stock rose 40%, and Apple climbed more than 35%.\n\nThe Magnificent 7 \u2014 Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 have accounted for about a third of the S&P 500 index\u2019s gains this year, largely powered by excitement around new AI technologies. But Goldman Sachs (GS) has warned that this \u201cunusual degree of market concentration\u201d could pose a major risk next year.\n\nStocks that have benefited from the AI boom have largely done so independent of interest rates. But that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t in for a correction as the market settles from the post-presidential election rally. Dietze said that could happen in the not-so-distant future.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re riding a secular tailwind of extreme innovation that could plow right through that,\u201d Dietze said. \u201cNevertheless, no sector operates in a silo or a vacuum. If everything else around them is struggling, they\u2019re gonna struggle a little bit, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDietze said one major theme for 2025 will be: show me the money. While major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have poured billions into AI partnerships and their own initiatives, investors are likely going to start looking for proof of returns next year, Dietze said.\n\n\u201cWall Street\u2019s the type of place where it\u2019s like, \u2018Show me the money, like, yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThese investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street\u2019s going to say, \u2018No, we\u2019ve seen the capital expenditures, you\u2019ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna be watching so carefully next year,\u201d Dietze said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor above.",

            "content": "Thanks to Alphabet Inc's GOOGGOOGL Google Quantum AI announcing its latest quantum chip Willow, sentiment for sector-related securities \u2014 which was already blossoming \u2014 stepped up several notches. At the same time, investors have legitimate concerns about individual names like IonQ IONQ moving too far, too fast.\n\nFundamentally, quantum computers and their ability to process complex calculations swiftly offers incredible implications for artificial intelligence. However, the business side also matters, potentially drawing skepticism. For example, IonQ's revenue growth on a sequential basis has noticeably slowed. In addition, the company currently posts losses.\n\nThe other factor that investors turning into the quantum computing narrative should assess is sentiment among institutional investors. Last Thursday, the largest transaction in the options market by far was for sold calls; specifically, $810,000 worth of $65 short calls expiring April 17, 2025. Earlier this morning, the derivatives market lit up again, with purchased $30 put options expiring on the aforementioned date garnering the spotlight.\n\nWith the smart money betting for the downside outcome, retail investors should at least consider following suit.\n\nSee Also: Is SPY Losing Its Spark? The S&P 500\u2019s Risk Conundrum\n\nHistorical Trends Don't Bode Well For IonQ Stock\n\nFrom a bullish point of view, one of the main concerns about betting long on IonQ stock is that it features a negative bias. Going back to its market debut in January 2021, there have been 208 weeks. Out of this figure, only 93 weeks saw a positive return from Monday's opening price to Friday's close. Accounting for four weeks of flat returns, this leaves only a 44.71% success ratio for the bulls on any given week.\n\nInterestingly, during periods of extreme sentiment cycles where the price action runs multiple standard deviations beyond the mean, the aforementioned negative bias remains intact. For example, there have been 40 weeks (not including December 2024) where IonQ stock returned 10% or greater. Within this tally, IonQ recorded 17 instances where it posted a non-zero positive return by the end of the fourth subsequent week or a success ratio of 42.5%.\n\nWhat's more, there have been 14 weeks where IonQ stock returned 20% or greater. By the end of the fourth subsequent week, there had been six instances where IonQ posted a positive return or 42.86%. The bottom line? Initial strength in IONQ stock tends to beget more strength, perhaps a byproduct of the fear of missing out (FOMO). But consistently, shares eventually lose steam.\n\nAnother reason to be cautious about IonQ stock is its technical pattern. Currently, IonQ appears to be printing a bearish head-and-shoulders formation. If so, the pattern may suggest near-term downside risk.\n\nExtracting Profits with a Bear Put Spread\n\nNotably, for the business week ending Dec. 20, IonQ stock delivered a 36.8% return. As discussed earlier, the security tends to have a negative bias as early buying activity fades. Further, on the negative instances when IonQ falls four weeks after posting a weekly return of 20% or greater, the average loss comes out to 14.6%.\n\nTherefore, a baseline target is to assume the possibility of shares falling to $37.95 (14.6% below the Dec. 20 closing price of $44.42) by the Jan. 17, 2025 expiration date. An aggressive approach is to consider the 40/38 bear put spread. This strategy involves buying the $40 put and simultaneously selling the $38 put. The credit received from the short put partially offsets the debit paid for the long put.\n\nHowever, in order to collect the maximum payout of 102%, IonQ stock must fall to $38 or below by the close of Jan. 17. Again, that might be aggressive for some investors. A more conservative wager would be the 41.50/40 bear put spread. In this trade, IonQ only needs to fall to $40 by expiration to collect the maximum reward, which is a payout of 76.5%.\n\nNow Read:\n\nImage: Courtesy of IONQ",

            "content": "In the ever-evolving world of stock markets, Alphabet shares\u2014traditionally known as the holdings in Google\u2019s parent company\u2014are now taking on a whole new dimension with the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Alphabet Inc. has announced a groundbreaking update to its operations, signaling an era where AI directly influences share valuation. The advent of AI-driven analytical models means these shares could become more dynamic and responsive to market changes.\n\nHistorically, stock prices have depended on human interpretation of vast amounts of data, encompassing economic indicators, news cycles, and more. However, Alphabet\u2019s incorporation of AI into financial analysis could redefine these paradigms. With machine learning models now analyzing subtle socioeconomic variables in real-time, subtle fluctuations in Alphabet shares could become significantly more predictable.\n\nThis innovative approach has potential implications beyond just Alphabet\u2019s stock performance. Investors may soon expect AI integration as a standard across markets, as it holds the promise of reduced volatility and dramatically improved market intelligence. The algorithms\u2019 predictive capabilities could foresee market shifts before they become apparent through traditional methodologies.\n\nHowever, this AI integration also poses ethical and practical challenges. The intense reliance on AI could skew market fairness and raise questions about data transparency. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape will have to evolve to keep pace with this cutting-edge financial technology.\n\nAs the integration of AI continues to reshape the financial world, Alphabet shares stand at the forefront of a potentially transformative wave in global investing practices. Stay tuned for more as the story develops.\n\nAI-Driven Stock Markets: A New Dawn or a Potential Dilemma?\n\nThe incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the stock market isn\u2019t just about boosting the value of Alphabet shares\u2014it\u2019s a harbinger of broader changes that could redefine the financial landscape. The inclusion of AI in financial analytics presents intriguing prospects for humanity and the development of new technologies in multiple arenas.\n\nPotential Benefits and Ethical Quandaries\n\nCould the AI-driven approach actually democratize investing, potentially allowing individual investors to leverage sophisticated models usually reserved for big financial institutions? This advancement might reduce the unpredictability that often hampers traditional stock markets, yet it brings up critical ethical concerns. With AI leading decision-making processes, the question looms: Can algorithms ever be fully unbiased? There\u2019s a risk of perpetuating existing biases in the datasets that train these models, potentially skewing outcomes.\n\nTransparency and Regulation\n\nThe regulatory framework needs urgent attention. How can governments ensure transparency and fairness in an AI-dominated market? The presence of AI could make it easier to manipulate perceptions, raising the need for stringent regulations. The technology\u2019s ability to predict market changes with uncanny precision brings a new paradigm in investment strategies.\n\nImpact Across Industries\n\nBeyond financial markets, AI\u2019s predictive prowess can affect numerous sectors. For instance, imagine its impact on supply chain management, where predicting consumer demand is pivotal. However, with tech giants like Alphabet leading the charge, there\u2019s apprehension about smaller entities being left behind, unable to match the AI-related advancements required to stay competitive.\n\nIn a complex landscape of technological evolution, navigating the advantages and potential pitfalls requires informed perspectives and strategic oversight.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the defining investment narrative of the year, sparking a wave of innovation and excitement across industries. Companies are rushing to embrace this transformative technology, eager to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape. Tech giants, with their deep pockets and relentless ambition, have been leading the charge, pouring billions of dollars into funding this AI craze.\n\nIn fact, the global AI market is on a meteoric rise, with projections revealing that revenue is set to hit an impressive $184 billion by the close of this year. Yet, despite the explosive rise of AI in 2024, the revolution is far from over. By 2030, this figure is expected to skyrocket to a staggering $826.7 billion, demonstrating a remarkable 28.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) spanning 2024 to 2030.\n\nThese jaw-dropping numbers underscore the unstoppable momentum of AI as it continues to disrupt industries, redefine business strategies, and transform the global economy. With the AI momentum unlikely to fade away anytime soon, investment firm Jefferies believes the upcoming year will bring even bigger wins for these three mega-cap AI stocks.\n\nAI Stock #1: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Corporation ( MSFT ) is a true tech powerhouse. Famous for its iconic products like Microsoft Office and Teams, the tech giant has been taking its vision to new heights with a bold focus on AI. From Windows and Xbox to Microsoft 365, Teams, and Azure AI, Microsoft seamlessly weaves advanced AI into its expansive ecosystem.\n\nThis integration drives billions of intelligent experiences every day, transforming how the world works, collaborates, and connects. Presently commanding a hefty market cap of almost $3.26 trillion, Microsoft's shares climbed roughly 13% over the past 52 weeks .\n\nMicrosoft is also firmly committed to returning value to its shareholders. With an impressive 20-year streak of dividend growth, the tech giant has consistently rewarded its investors. Earlier this month, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share , set to be distributed to its shareholders on Mar. 13, 2025. Its annualized dividend of $3.32 per share translates to a modest 0.8% yield, reflecting a stable approach to shareholder returns.\n\nIn fact, in its most recent earnings report, the company revealed that it had delivered a remarkable $9 billion in returns during fiscal 2025 Q1 through a strategic mix of share repurchases and dividends. Microsoft dropped its fiscal 2025 Q1 earnings report on Oct. 30, which blew past both Wall Street\u2019s top- and bottom-line expectations . The tech giant experienced a solid 16% year-over-year revenue growth, reaching $65.6 billion, just edging past analysts\u2019 forecasts, while its EPS of $3.30 represented a 10% increase from the previous year, exceeding projections by roughly 7.1% margin.\n\nDriving this success was its commercial cloud business, which soared with a notable 22% annual revenue increase to $38.9 billion. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, also demonstrated a solid 20% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $24.1 billion, driven by surging demand for Azure and its other cloud services.\n\nReflecting on the company\u2019s Q1 performance, CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the transformative power of AI, underscoring its ability to revolutionize roles, workflows, and business processes across industries. During the Q1 earnings call , Microsoft\u2019s management spotlighted Azure as a major growth engine within its Intelligent Cloud segment, forecasting a 31% to 32% revenue increase in Q2, driven by robust demand for cloud services.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft expects to \u201cadd more sequential dollars to Azure\u201d in Q2 than in any quarter in the company\u2019s history. Analysts tracking Microsoft project the company\u2019s profit to increase 9.6% year-over-year to $12.93 per share in fiscal 2025 and rise another 14.3% to $14.78 per share in fiscal 2026.\n\nJefferies highlighted Microsoft\u2019s strong position in the generative AI landscape, poised to benefit from the expanding growth of Azure AI infrastructure and the growing adoption of its Copilot applications. While the stock has underperformed both the broader market and certain tech ETFs, Jefferies anticipates a rerating as Azure\u2019s momentum accelerates and Copilot continues to gain traction.\n\nWith these developments in mind, Jefferies maintains a \"Buy\" rating on MSFT, with a price target of $550, reflecting confidence in its future growth potential. Overall, Wall Street is highly bullish, with a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating on MSFT stock. Out of the 41 analysts covering the stock, 34 recommend a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d four suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and the remaining three give a \u201cHold\u201d rating.\n\nThe average analyst price target of $508.31 indicates potential upside of 16% from the current price levels. However, the Street-high price target of $600 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 37% from current levels.\n\nAI Stock #2: Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) is reshaping industries from healthcare and entertainment to AI and autonomous driving. Deeply embedded in its products like Gmail, Google Maps, and Photos, AI is driving new standards for user experience and efficiency. The company\u2019s ecosystem, which spans Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, works in seamless harmony. Google Services dominates with its search engine, while Google Cloud leads with next-gen enterprise solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets division pioneers transformative initiatives, including Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars and DeepMind\u2019s cutting-edge AI research. With a massive market cap of approximately $2.4 trillion, shares of this tech behemoth are up nearly 36% over the past year , outshining the broader S&P 500 Index\u2019s ( $SPX ) 24% annual return .\n\nIn a landmark decision earlier this year, Alphabet paid its inaugural dividend of $0.20 per share on June 17. Recently, the company followed up with another quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share on Dec. 16, signaling its growing commitment to rewarding shareholders. With a forward annualized dividend of $0.80 per share, Alphabet offers a modest 0.42% yield, marking a new chapter in its shareholder-friendly approach.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Q3 earnings report , released on Oct. 29, shattered Wall Street\u2019s expectations , propelling its stock to a nearly 2.8% jump in the following trading session. The company posted total revenue of $88.3 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase fueled by strong performance across its diverse business segments. This figure easily surpassed Wall Street\u2019s anticipated $86.2 billion. Meanwhile, EPS showed a notable 36.8% year-over-year improvement to $2.12, exceeding forecasts by a solid 15.9% margin .\n\nDelving into the segments, Google Services delivered 13% annual revenue growth, reaching $76.5 billion, driven by standout performances across its core areas. Google Search, subscriptions, platforms, devices, and YouTube ads all contributed to this broad-based strength, underscoring the company's continued dominance in advertising and digital services.\n\nOn the cloud front, Alphabet reported $11.4 billion in revenue, marking a nearly 35% year-over-year surge, driven by robust growth in its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offerings. This strong performance underscores the expanding reach of Google Cloud as it continues to gain traction among enterprises. Additionally, Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets segment, which includes Waymo, saw a notable revenue boost, rising to $388 million from $297 million the previous year.\n\nWhile reflecting on the company\u2019s Q3 performance, CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company\u2019s remarkable momentum, attributing much of its success to its unwavering focus on innovation and strategic investments in AI. He emphasized that these efforts are not only driving growth, but also delivering tangible benefits to both consumers and partners.\n\nAnalysts tracking Alphabet project the company\u2019s profit to climb a remarkable 38.3% year-over-year to $8.02 per share in fiscal 2024 and rise another 11.2% to $8.92 per share in fiscal 2025. As for Jefferies, the investment firm highlighted Alphabet\u2019s status as an AI pioneer, with an exciting pipeline of new products ready to be rolled out across its seven apps, each boasting over 2 billion users. The firm added, \u201cThe impressive performance of GOOGL\u2019s models positions them to make significant strides in Cloud, where it currently lags peers.\"\n\nOverall, Wall Street remains highly optimistic on GOOGL stock, maintaining a consensus rating of \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d Of the 50 analysts offering recommendations, 40 advise a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and the remaining seven analysts maintain a \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nThe average analyst price target of $211.86 indicates 8.3% potential upside, while the Street-high price target of $240 suggests that GOOGL could rally as much as 22.7% from here.\n\nAI Stock #3: Amazon\n\nAmazon ( AMZN ) has dramatically expanded its reach in recent years, evolving from an e-commerce giant to a major player in entertainment with services like Amazon Prime Video, Music, Prime Gaming, and Twitch. Beyond entertainment, the company has made significant inroads into cloud computing and AI through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, positioning itself at the forefront of the rapidly growing demand for cloud solutions and AI-driven technologies.\n\nValued at a market cap of approximately $2.39 trillion, shares of the mega-cap e-commerce company have outperformed the broader market over the past year, delivering gains of nearly 46% .\n\nFollowing the release of Amazon's Q3 earnings report on Oct. 31, which sailed past Wall Street\u2019s forecasts , shares of the retail giant closed up more than 6% in the next trading session. Net sales for the quarter surged 11% year over year to reach $158.9 billion, edging past Wall Street's forecast of $157.3 billion. Earnings also soared 49.4% annually to $1.43 per share, smashing Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a 25.4% margin .\n\nThe North American division delivered a 9% year-over-year increase, generating $95.5 billion in sales. Meanwhile, its international division sales saw a 12% annual jump, reaching $35.9 billion. However, it was AWS that truly stole the show, posting 19% year-over-year growth and raking in $27.5 billion in revenue.\n\nThis remarkable surge further cements AWS' leadership in the rapidly growing cloud and AI markets. As of Sept. 30, Amazon's free cash flow surged to an impressive $47.7 billion, marking a dramatic leap from $21.4 billion in the same period last year. This impressive growth not only highlights Amazon\u2019s strong financial foundation but also underscores its robust ability to generate cash, positioning the company for sustained growth and continued leadership in the tech industry.\n\nLooking forward to Q4, the company expects net sales to range between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, indicating a year-over-year growth of 7% to 11%. Plus, operating income is anticipated to land between $16 billion and $20 billion, compared to $13.2 billion in Q4 of fiscal 2023. Over the longer term, analysts tracking Amazon expect the company\u2019s bottom line to jump 86.3% year over year to $5.29 per share in fiscal 2024 and grow another 17.8% to $6.23 per share in fiscal 2025.\n\nAccording to Jefferies analysts, Amazon dominates more than 50% of the cloud service provider market, positioning itself for substantial AI-driven revenue growth in the future. With this impressive market share fueling its AI potential, Jefferies raised its price target for Amazon to $275 from $235, maintaining its \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nAMZN stock has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of the 49 analysts covering the stock, 45 recommend a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and only one analyst gives a \u201cHold\u201d rating.",

            "content": "There are hundreds of alphabets and writing systems in the world. The brilliant invention of a symbolic code to record human history, however, ironically did not preserve the details of its own origin. We still cannot pinpoint with certainty when or where the alphabet was first created. Until now, it was widely believed to have emerged around 1900 BCE in what is now Egypt. A recent discovery in Syria, however, suggests that the alphabet\u2019s origin may date back an additional 500 years.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphics were in use as early as 3250 BCE, but an even older precursor existed in the cuneiform script of Mesopotamia. Neither hieroglyphics nor cuneiform were alphabets in the modern sense, relying instead on symbols and syllables. The first alphabet is thought to be the Proto-Sinaitic script, discovered in 1904 in the Sinai Peninsula by Egyptologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie.\n\nAround 1900 B.C., the time when this script was in use \u2014 of which only a few dozen examples survive \u2014 the inhabitants of the Sinai were Semites under Egyptian rule. It is believed that they adapted the Egyptian hieroglyphs to their own language, inventing a consonantal alphabet, which would later lead to the Phoenician and Greek alphabets. But was this truly the first?\n\nIn 2004, an excavation at Tell Umm-el Marra, an ancient city about 35 miles east of Aleppo, Syria, unearthed a tomb containing six skeletons, jewelry, cooking utensils, a spearhead, ceramic vessels, and four perforated clay cylinders inscribed with symbols. In 2010, Glenn Schwartz, co-director of the excavation and a professor at Johns Hopkins University, suggested in a paper that these marks might represent a form of writing. \u201cI was cautious not to push the similarity to alphabetic characters too far, because I\u2019m an archaeologist, not a philologist or an expert on ancient writing systems,\u201d Schwartz explains.\n\nA unique invention\n\nThe response to his study among philologists was nonexistent; no one commented or engaged with his hypothesis. However, convinced that the marks on the cylinders were comparable to the ancient alphabets of the region, Schwartz presented his proposal again in 2019 at a conference and in 2021 in a new study. This time, two experts on ancient alphabets, Christopher Rollston and Madadh Richey, agreed with him. \u201cWith two experts now in agreement, I decided it was time to share it more widely,\u201d says Schwartz. He has now presented all the details of his discovery at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research\n\n\u201cThese four inscriptions display the hallmarks of alphabetic writing, based on the morphology and the shape of several of the signs,\u201d says Rollston, a professor of Biblical and Near Eastern languages and civilizations at George Washington University, who had worked with Schwartz in the past but was not involved in the discovery. \u201cIt seems reasonable to me to consider them alphabetic writing.\u201d Rollston says that he studied Schwartz\u2019s discovery for years before issuing his verdict, which he posted on his blog in 2021.\n\nIf the marks on the cylinders indeed represent a form of writing, they would also rewrite the history of the alphabet. Carbon-14 dating places their origin around 2,400 BC, which suggests that the Tell Umm-el Marra alphabet predates the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet by half a millennium. According to Rollston, \u201cthe alphabet was invented once, and all alphabetic writing systems derive from the original alphabet,\u201d meaning that this would be the first alphabet from which others, including the Proto-Sinaitic, originated. Rollston\u2019s only doubt concerns the reliability of the dating and whether the cylinders could be from a later period, but Schwartz stands by his findings.\n\nThe mystery of \u201cSilanu\u201d\n\nNot all experts are convinced. Philippa Steele, a researcher in classical culture at Cambridge University, notes that while she is not a complete skeptic and believes it is a writing system, she questions whether it can be classified as alphabetic. \u201cThe main problem is that there are too few signs to definitively prove that it is an alphabetic system,\u201d she explains. Steele argues that an alphabet typically consists of 20 to 40 signs, whereas a syllabic script contains more than 50, and in this case, it\u2019s unclear which category it falls into. \u201cSome of the signs resemble other alphabetic signs from Proto-Sinaitic, but there\u2019s no obvious relationship in others.\u201d Steele would like to see additional examples from a larger sample, but such evidence has yet to be found.\n\nSchwartz not only defends the alphabetic nature of the inscriptions but also offers a possible reading of one of them: \u201cSilanu.\u201d \u201cMy colleague Ted Lewis, a professor at my university and an expert on ancient Semitic languages, suggested this interpretation, which I think is worth considering,\u201d he says. As for the meaning of the word, one can only speculate. Schwartz suggests that it could be a name, with the hollow cylinders perhaps serving as labels tied to vessels, and \u201cSilanu\u201d potentially referring to the giver or recipient of a gift. However, Steele cautions that \u201cit is difficult to make such a suggestion beyond mere speculation.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s objections also stem from the lack of context, as well as geographical and chronological consistency. She questions whether an entire alphabet, which would have required time and effort to develop and was believed to have been widespread, could have remained hidden, with such few surviving samples. But Schwartz explains why this may be the case: \u201cThe clay cylinders are small, fragile, and blend in with the color of the soil. At first glance, they look like pieces of dirt, so it would be easy to overlook them. Moreover, it\u2019s possible that the people of that time wrote on more perishable materials.\u201d He concludes: \u201cIf the excavations in Syria continue, perhaps more examples will surface.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about.\n\nAs trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned.\n\nHowever, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence.\n\nYet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement.\n\nCramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that \"rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing\" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. \"How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don\u2019t even know what quantum is?\" wondered Cramer. \"It\u2019s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?\u201d he added.\n\nStory Continues",

But this is worth discussing in the case of Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL. The Google parent company has the lowest forward valuation multiple among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Using a forward P/E of 22x for the S&P 500, it is also the only Magnificent Seven stock trading below or equal to the broader market valuation.\n\nThat might feel a bit out of place, considering the firm just announced a breakthrough in quantum computing. Still, there are certainly concerns around this company that are weighing on shares. I\u2019ll break down and analyze Alphabet\u2019s key business segments and provide my outlook on this tech stock.\n\nGet Alphabet alerts: Sign Up\n\nGoogle Search: Still the King of Internet Searching Despite Chatbot Fears\n\nThe biggest revenue driver for Alphabet is Google Search. Companies pay Google for ad placement on their search results and are charged when users click on their ads. Google Search accounted for around 55% of total revenue last quarter. This revenue concentration is one factor weighing on Google. As more people discover the often-superior search capabilities of chatbots like ChatGPT, analysts fear a loss of traffic to Google Search.\n\nSo far, that hasn\u2019t caused Google Search revenues to suffer. They have grown by over 10% from the previous year in each of the last five quarters. However, ChatGPT does appear to be taking market share as a primary search engine. A good sign is that the loss in market share was less significant in shopping and travel searches. These types of searches generate a lot of ad sales.\n\nGoogle is fighting against the rise of chatbots. The company will reportedly roll out an \u201cAI Mode\u201d within Google Search. It aims to keep the familiar nature of Google Search, combining it with the Gen-AI capabilities of its Gemini model. Google has billions of daily users, making it still many times larger than ChatGPT\u2019s 300 million weekly users. As Google adds new AI features, I believe it can keep its huge search market share. Users are extremely familiar with its product. Additionally, ChatGPT is not that new at this point; it is just over two years old. The fact that Google Search revenues remain strong is a good sign for the future.\n\nThe potential antitrust breakup of Google Search is another concern; however, the company will fight this tooth and nail. It will likely appeal any decisions that go against it, delaying real impacts for several years.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Businesses Are Strong, Waymo and Quantum Add Long-Term Upside\n\nAside from Search, Alphabet has several other important revenue-generating parts of its business. This includes revenue from YouTube ads, third-party ad sales, subscriptions, platforms, device revenue, and Google Cloud revenue. Each of these four segments made up between 8% and 13% of total revenue last quarter. Almost all of these saw solid growth last quarter. The third-party advertising business has been declining steadily; however, it is the smallest of these segments.\n\nThe push away from traditional television is a secular trend that is a strong tailwind for YouTube ad revenue. Additionally, the Google Cloud business is seeing accelerating growth. Overall, the vast majority of Alphabet\u2019s business remains strong. The company\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d segment is where exciting long-term potential lies despite not helping generate much revenue right now.\n\nAlphabet Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$210.62\n\n17.23% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 43 Analyst Ratings High Forecast $230.00 Average Forecast $210.62 Low Forecast $181.00 Alphabet Stock Forecast Details\n\nTwo massive projects that fall into this segment are Waymo and Google Quantum AI. The company is establishing itself as a leader in two potentially huge technologies of the future: autonomous driving and quantum computing. Waymo was the first to complete fully autonomous trips on public roads in 2017. It is now the leader in robotaxi services. Experts project that the overall ride-sharing market will nearly quadruple in size by 2032.\n\nGoogle's recent unveiling of its Willow quantum chip was a breakthrough. It set off a huge rally for other quantum stocks. This is a much more long-term bet that won\u2019t bear fruit in terms of revenue for at least several years. However, it could be huge if quantum computers can eventually outperform supercomputers in commercially relevant applications.\n\nAlphabet Could Be One of the Best Magnificent 7 Stocks to Own\n\nOverall, Alphabet\u2019s business remains strong, and signs point to its ability to hold onto much of its dominance. The company\u2019s long-term bets in potentially world-altering areas add upside investors shouldn't ignore. Its valuation, compared to the other Magnificent Seven stocks, could make it one of the best long-term plays among the group.\n\nBefore you consider Alphabet, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm\u2019s focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\n10-Year Revenue CAGR: 18.24%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 160\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a multinational technology conglomerate that serves as the parent company of Google, YouTube, and a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries, including Waymo, a leader in self-driving technology. It has also developed Gemini, a family of advanced LLMs that power its chatbot and enhance AI features in Google Search.\n\nDuring Q3 2024, the company generated $88.3 billion in revenue, a 15% year-over-year increase. Google Advertising remained the primary revenue driver, contributing over 74% of the total revenue. In response to investor expectations for a strong return on significant AI investments, management is exploring strategies to enhance monetization through AI Overviews and other innovative features.\n\nTo elevate the internet search experience, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has introduced AI Overviews. This feature delivers AI-generated summaries at the forefront of search results, integrating text, images, and links to facilitate user access to information. AI Overviews is projected to serve over a billion users monthly and is currently undergoing a global rollout across 100 countries.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO emphasized its progress in optimizing AI Overviews, achieving over 90% reduction in cost per query within 18 months while doubling the scale of its custom Gemini model. It\u2019s fair to say that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to capitalize on the emerging AI trends.\n\nDespite investor concerns regarding significant capital expenditures related to AI development, RiverPark Large Growth Fund highlighted Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) strong Q3 results, including robust Search and Cloud growth. Here\u2019s what the firm stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): Google was our top detractor in the third quarter despite reporting second quarter results that were generally in line with expectations. The company reported slightly better revenue growth in Search, which grew 14% and continues to be resilient in the face of AI challengers, and Google Cloud, which grew 29% in the quarter. Service operating income margins of 40% and Cloud operating income margins of 11% were also both ahead of investors\u2019 expectations as management\u2019s cost-efficiency efforts drove operating leverage. YouTube revenue growth was slightly below expectations (+13% v. +16%) driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons and some general weakness in the Brand Advertising vertical. Finally, Cap Ex in the quarter of $13.2 billion was more than expected and likely the driver of the weakness in the stock as investors grapple with how much infrastructure investment will be required to achieve Google\u2019s AI goals. With its high margin business model (44% EBITDA margins last quarter), continued strength across its core Search and YouTube franchises, and continued growth and expanding profitability in its still relatively small Cloud business, we continue to view Alphabet as among the best-positioned secular growth franchises in the market. Additionally, GOOG shares trade at a compelling 19.5x the Street\u2019s 2025 EPS estimate, a discount to the Russell 1000 Growth Index.\u201d\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The framework of the DR-LIFT method is shown in Figure 1. The input Tamil inscriptions, such as Vattezhuthu and Brahmi, are captured using a smartphone camera using the MIT APP inverter. The captured images are de-noised using the DnCNN model to remove the noise from the inscriptions. The initial process is the alphabet detection, which uses three NN models such as DBNet, FCENet and TextSnake. The above three methods are used for the identification of the alphabet. Once the alphabets are recognized, the next step is the identification of the works from the inscriptions. Recognition is done using the proposed methods such as ABINet, MASTER and SAR. Finally, the Tamil words are labelled with the proposed methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Three types of GNNs are proposed for labelling such as FNN, RNN, and CNN. Once labelling is done, the interpretation of modern Tamil characters and the corresponding words is done. Figure 2 illustrates the workflow of the proposed method and shows the pipelining between the alphabet detection, word recognition, and labelling stages. It demonstrates how the ancient Tamil stone inscriptions in Brahmi and Vattezhuthu scripts are recognized and converted into modern Tamil words using the proposed DR-LIFT method.\n\nFig. 1 Workflow of the proposed DR-LIFT framework of third century Tamil inscription in Brahmi and Vattezhuthu styles Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Pipelining of the overall architecture of the proposed system Full size image\n\nFigure 2 shows the pipelining between the alphabet detection, word recognition, and sentence labelling processes. It shows what input and output go into and out of each recognition process.\n\nDataset description\n\nIn the proposed DR-LIFT method, our dataset is used, and the description of the dataset is given in Table 2. Figure 3 shows some of the sample images of early Tamil inscriptions on stone, temples and walls of the 3rd century. The images in the dataset are de-noised using the DnCNN algorithm. Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (DnCNN) overcomes occlusion and weathering effects by effectively removing noise and enhancing the clarity of the input images. This network is trained to distinguish between the noise and the underlying patterns or features in an image. When applied to ancient inscriptions, DnCNN can filter out the distortions caused by occlusion (such as overlapping objects) and weathering (like erosion or fading), thereby revealing the original text or features more clearly.\n\nTable 2 Dataset Description Full size table\n\nFig. 3 Sample Stone Inscriptions Images of both Tamil Vattezhuthu Tamil Brahmi Full size image\n\nIdentification of stone inscriptions\n\nDBNet\n\nFigure 4 depicts the model of the proposed DR-LIFT for the identification of Tamil stone inscriptions, which is the backbone and initial process applied to the input Tamil inscription image. DBNet (Differentiable Binarization Network) enhances text recognition by applying a differentiable binarization module, which enables precise text boundary detection even in complex backgrounds. Its end-to-end optimization of both segmentation and binarization improves accuracy and efficiency, making it particularly effective for detecting irregular and small text in natural scenes compared to traditional methods. The up-sampling of the features in the image is done with an identical scale and divided into a feature map 'F'. This feature map predicts the probability (P) and the threshold map (T). From 'P' and 'F', we can find the value of the binary map \\(\\widehat{B}\\)(approximate), which is computed. During training, supervision is applied over the three maps such as \u2018P\u2019, \u2018T\u2019 and \\(\\widehat{B}\\), in which P and \\(\\widehat{B}\\) share identical supervision. The bounding box is found during the inference period from \\(\\widehat{B}\\) and P using the box formulation. The dataset was pre-trained for 100,000 iterations, and the models were fine-tuned using the test data for 1,000 epochs. The training batch size is set to 15, with an initial learning rate of 0.0006. A weight decay of 0.0001 is applied, and momentum is set to 0.9. The proposed DR-LIFT method employs a polynomial learning rate, where the learning rate at any given iteration is calculated as follows:\\(Learning Rate=0.0006 {\\left(1-\\frac{iterations}{ max\\_itertions}\\right)}^{0.9}\\). In this equation, max_iterations refers to the maximum number of iterations allowed [5] to avoid overfitting. In the proposed DBNet method, the initial process is character identification and binarization, which extracts the individual letters from the given image. In DBNet, the Differential Binarization (DB) method is used, and the approximate binary map \\(\\widehat{B}\\) is computed as in Eq. (1).\n\n$$\\widehat{B}\\left(i,j\\right)=\\frac{1}{1+{e}^{-k(P\\left(i,j\\right)-T(i,j)}}$$ (1)\n\nwhere 'T' is the adaptive threshold and 'k' is the amplifying factor. The empirical value of 'k' is assigned as fifty. This binary function is differentiable; optimization is used during the segmentation network while training. The DB method can differentiate the text from its background and isolate the instances of the text that are packed closely.\n\nFig. 4 Working process of DB Net Full size image\n\nThreshold Map (T) Creation\n\nThe threshold map highlights the border of the text without supervision. It creates a 'T' map using border-like supervision and leads to better results. This threshold map is used as a threshold for the binarization process. Figure 5a\u2013d shows the threshold map of the segmented characters.\n\nFig. 5 Threshold map of the stone inscription a segmented character, b probability map, c supervised threshold map and d enhanced character Full size image\n\nFCENet\n\nThe second proposed method for recognizing stone inscriptions is the Fourier Contour Embedding Net (FCENet), adapted from [6]. FCENet removes the noise in the stone inscriptions as it converts the text contours into the frequency domain using the Fourier series, enabling the network to focus on the most significant components while filtering out noise. By operating in the frequency domain, FCENet effectively distinguishes between genuine text contours and noise, even when the input text is occluded or affected by weathering.\n\nFigure 6 shows the workflow of the FCENet method. From the input image, feature extraction is done in the backbone, which holds the ResNet 50 along with DCN and FPN and is given as input to the shared head for text detection. The classification branch in the shared head predicts the text region heatmap and the text centre region heatmap, and then pixel-wise multiplications result in the classification score map. The regression branch carries out the prediction of Fourier vectors that reconstruct the text contours through the IFT. The final text detection is formed through non-maximum suppression, abbreviated as NMS. Predictions are made on P3, P4, and P5 feature maps. Both branches have three (3 \u00d7 3) convolution layers and one (1 \u00d7 1) convolution layer. The classification branch predicts every mask of text areas and, finds the text centre region and performs better. The Fourier vector in the regression branch regresses every pixel in the text. Text instances with different scales are handled by the features P3 to P5. The size of the scales are small (P3), medium (P4) and significant texts (P5). The final detected results are obtained through the reconstruction of the Fourier domain using IFT and non-maximum suppression. FCENet stands out in text recognition by directly modeling arbitrary-shaped text contours using Fourier transformation, enabling more accurate detection of complex, curved texts. Additionally, its contour-based representation improves precision in detecting irregular text boundaries, outperforming conventional rectangular or quadrilateral bounding box methods commonly used in other text recognition models.\n\nTextSnake (TS)\n\nTextSnake provides a more flexible way of text representation that can predict curves. Figure 7 shows the character recognition method with TextSnake. From the inscription in Fig. 7 (a), an individual character is segmented, and the recognition process continues along the centre. TS can adapt according to the text, and changes can be made instantly using bending, rotation, or scaling. Figure 7 is specifically shown for Vattezhuthu, and the same process is used for the Brahmi inscription. The blue circles inside the red text region are each created with the centre line along the symmetric axis with radius R and an orientation of \u03b8. Traditional methods use rectangles or quadrangles for text representation in which irregular shapes in text instances cannot be described. Meanwhile, Consider any sample text k, which contains more than one character; k can be represented as a list, say, M(k), where M(k) is an ordered list. M(k) = {A(0),A(1),\u2026..,A(i),\u2026A(n)}. In the list M(k), A(i) denotes the disk in its position, and n denotes the total count of available disks. Every disk A holds a set of geometrical attributes, for example, A = (c, r, \u03b8). \u2018c' indicates the centre, 'r' is the radius and '\u03b8' is the orientation of A. The text k gets reconstructed by calculating the union of all the disks in the ordered list M(k).\n\nFig. 7 a depicts the segmentation of the characters, and b shows the disks and their centre point. c shows the text region as an ordered list, as depicted by the red line Full size image\n\nWords recognition\n\nOnce the characters are identified, the next step is recognizing words. Three models are proposed in this study such as, (i) ABINet, (ii) MASTER and (iii) SAR. These methods are end-to-end text recognition methods and attention mechanisms, which can recognize stone inscriptions without clear word boundaries and spacing [8,9,10]. Bounding boxes will segment the letters and words, and recognition accuracy is in the range of 85\u201390%\n\nABINet\n\nThe main principle behind ABINet is the concept of Autonomous-Bidirectional-Iterative (ABI) [10]. The autonomous model blocks gradient flow between the vision and language models, ensuring that language modelling is enforced explicitly. To overcome the challenge of recognizing words in Tamil inscriptions without explicit spacing, the ABINet model, and specifically its Bidirectional Cloze Network (BCN) component, proves to be highly effective. The iterative correction method for the language model effectively mitigates the impact of noisy input. By incorporating sophisticated language modelling techniques, this model functions independently, enabling the separation of visual and language models, which improves text recognition accuracy, especially in difficult conditions such as low-quality images or texts with unclear word boundaries. There are two models in ABINet: (i) The vision model (VM) and (ii) The Language Model (LM). The VM has two main blocks: the backbone network and an attention module. The vision model comprises a backbone network and a positional attention module. In this method, ResNet is utilized for the feature extraction and Transformer units for the sequence modelling network. Figure 8 shows the structure of the ABINet architecture. Given an image x, the representation of feature extraction is given in Eq. (2).\n\nFig. 8 Structure of the ABINet Model Full size image\n\n$${{\\varvec{F}}}_{b}=T\\left(\\mathcal{R}\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\epsilon {\\mathbb{R}}^{\\frac{H}{4}X\\frac{W}{4}XC}$$ (2)\n\nIn the above equation, H and W are the size of x, and the feature dimension is denoted by C. The position attention modules copy the features into character probabilities simultaneously as per Eq. (3).\n\n$${F}_{v}=softmax \\left(\\frac{{QK}^{T}}{\\sqrt{C}}\\right)V$$ (3)\n\nSpecifically, \\(Q\\epsilon {\\mathbb{R}}^{TXC}\\) denotes the positional encodings of the order of character, and the character sequence length is denoted by T.\n\nThe Language Model (LM) has the following properties:\n\n1. Treating the LM as an independent spelling rectification model, which accepts inputs in vectors and allocates anticipated letters. 2. Blocking Gradient Flow (BGF) is performed at the input stage. 3. Text data is used to train the LM.\n\nAdopting the self-governing strategy enables the ABINet to be partitioned into meaningful and understandable units. The LM, the probability is considered to be the input, becomes consumable (allowing direct substitution with a more robust model) and flexible. Notably, the BGF inherently ensures the model learns linguistic knowledge, a significant departure from implicit modelling where the exact nature of the learned information is unknown. In the bi-directional representation, let M = (m 1 ,m 2 ,\u2026m n ) represent a string of text, where n represents the length of the text. The variable c denotes the class number, and the bidirectional model's conditional probability for M i is denoted by \\(P({m}_{i}|{m}_{n},\\dots {m}_{i+1},{m}_{i-1},\\dots .,{m}_{1})\\), and the unidirectional model's conditional probability is denoted by \\(P({m}_{i}|{m}_{i-1},\\dots {m}_{1})\\). The bidirectional representation is specified as \\({H}_{m}=\\left(n-1\\right)\\text{log}c\\), and the unidirectional information is represented as \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(i-1\\right)\\text{log}c=\\frac{1}{2}{H}_{m}\\). The traditional ensemble models incorporate two unidirectional models, which have a unidirectional representation, capture only \\(\\frac{1}{2}{H}_{m}\\) information, and reduce the model's ability to extract features. The LM removes the noise inputs, which improves the prediction of letters due to its iterative principle. Parallel prediction transformers include noise data from the input image, usually estimated characters obtained from visual predictions. The proposed DR-LIFT method removes the input noise by applying an iterative language model. In the iterative language model, various assignments of the variable m are done for multiple iterations of the LM, which leads to an accurate vision prediction.\n\nMASTER\n\nThe MASTER model comprises two essential packages: (i) Multi-Aspect Global Context Attention (GC Attention)\u2014based encoder and (ii) Transformer-based decoder. Rather than using one attention function, multiple attention functions are used, which are referred to as Multi-Aspect attention (MAGC). The encoder in the proposed model encodes the input image and creates a feature tensor. The primary role of this MASTER model is the MAGC encoding. Figure 9 depicts the structure of the MASTER model, which includes the MAGC attention-based encoder for representing the features and a decoder model. The feature map is denoted by C x H x W, which denotes the channel number, height, and width. The variable h represents the number of Multi aspects of Context, r is the bottleneck ratio, and C/r is the dimension of the bottleneck. The element-wise addition is indicated by \\(\\oplus and\\otimes\\), which denotes the matrix multiplication. The above model has the MAGC, a residual block (RB), max pooling and a convolution block. Inside the residual block, the projection shortcut is used in case of variable input, and for identical input, the identity shortcut is used. Next to the RB, the MAGC attention is induced and learns about the additional features. The size of the convolutional kernel is (3 \u00d7 3). A 1 \u00d7 2 max pooling layer is implemented in addition to the existing 2 \u00d7 2 max pooling layers and obtained the additional information, which recognizes the narrow and irregularly shaped characters. In the second part of the MASTER architecture, there is a decoder, which consists of a mass of basic blocks, which contains three core modules: (i) Multi-Head Attention, (ii) Masked Multi-Head Attention, and (iii) Feed Forward Network. A SoftMax and a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution operation is performed in the Global Context Block, where the feature map is converted.\n\nFig. 9 The MASTER model Full size image\n\nShow, attend and read (SAR)\n\nIn the SAR method, the input image is given to a ResNet, which consists of thirty-one layers that yield a two-dimensional feature map. Next, LSTM encodes the obtained 2D feature map. This encoding is done for every column; the last hidden state is considered a feature. A second LSTM model is used to decode the feature in order to get a series of characters. For every iteration during decoding, a weighted sum of two-dimensional features is computed by the attention module, depending on the current hidden state of the LSTM decoder. Figure 10 shows the SAR model\u2019s structure. ResNet CNN comprises thirty-one layers: the convolution layer, max pool layer, and residual block. For the residual block, an identity shortcut is used; if the input and output dimensions are identical, a projection shortcut is used for varying input and output dimensions. ResNet CNN comprises thirty-one layers: the convolution layer, max pool layer, and residual block. For the residual block, an identity shortcut is used; if the input and output dimensions are identical, a projection shortcut is used for varying input and output dimensions. SAR model uses an encoder-decoder model, which is based on two-dimensional attention for processing texts that have irregular shapes. The encoder in the SAR model consists of two LSTM layers with five hundred and twelve hidden states. At this stage, the hidden state value is updated. After the terminating condition is satisfied, the final hidden state in the second layer is declared as the holistic feature for the given input image, and the same is valid for decoding.\n\nFig. 10 Structure of the SAR model. The glimpses in the figure indicate the weighted sum of local features Full size image\n\nThe decoder is a two-layered LSTM model with an identical number of hidden layers as the encoder; there is no parameter sharing between the two. The initial input given to the decoder is the feature obtained from the decoder, and the process starts with the \"START\" token in the next step and continues until the LSTM layer receives the \"END\" token. At each step after the START token, the LSTM is fed with the output obtained in the previous step. In the training phase, the LSTM in the decoder is modified to match the ground truth character set. The final processing is the 2D attention module. Compared to the existing two-dimensional attention modules, where each location is treated independently, the proposed SAR method includes the 2D spatial relationships, which are easily achieved by the addition of multiple convolution operations. Table 3 gives the advantages of the deep learning methods ABINet, MASTER, and SAR proposed in the DRLIFT framework for word recognition.\n\nTable 3 Advantages of deep learning methods for word recognition Full size table\n\nLabelling using graph neural network (GNN)\n\nGraphs are usually used for identification of the relationship between nodes, and depending on the weights, two nodes are connected with an edge. Neural Network (NN) architecture is one of the modern tools used in prediction, problem-solving and computer vision. The label propagation method is used to understand the relationship between data. The combination of NN and graphs is termed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) method that works on deep neural networks with graph data structure. The neural network architectures are trained using supervised learning to learn the identical hidden representation for the nearest nodes. This process is called a Neural Graph Machine (NGM). In the proposed DR-LIFT method, three NN models are implemented for labelling. The NGM technique works iteratively and refines the labels of the nodes by adding identical information from the neighbouring nodes and propagating these tables to the next similar node. In the DR-LIFT method, the final step is graph labelling, which is used for the identification of the group of words that forms a sentence. The three NN methods listed below identify the words and output the meaning of the inscription in the modern Tamil language.\n\nFeedforward neural networks (FNN)\n\nAn FNN comprises more than one layer and consists of neurons connected. In this NN, the previous layer's output is fed as input to the next layer, and hence, they are stacked. The FNN has an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The central processing occurs in the hidden layer, and every node of this layer has a sum dependent on the input from the earlier layer. FFN can have many hidden layers. Alternatively, specific features serve as inputs. The parameters and their values that are used in the FNN are shown in Table 4. The FNN is used as a graph neural network to find Tamil inscriptions in modern Tamil. While the previous processes recognize the character and then the words, FNN implements the GNN and gives the output of the entire text. The Graph neural network model is trained using the labelled dataset, which is divided into training, validation, and test sets.\n\nTable 4 Architecture details of Feed Forward Neural Network Full size table\n\nRecurrent neural network (RNN)\n\nIn a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the output of the previous node is given as input to the next node. In NNs, the output and input layers or nodes are usually independent. The RNN layer remembers the previous words. The hidden layer remembers the information that is in a sequence, known as a memory state. The FNNs forward all the information, and there is no looping in them.\n\n$${h}_{t}=f({h}_{t-1},{x}_{t})$$ (4)\n\n$${h}_{t}=\\text{tanh}({W}_{hh}{h}_{t-1}+{W}_{xh}{x}_{t}$$ (5)\n\n$${y}_{t}={W}_{hy}{h}_{y}$$ (6)\n\nwhere h t ,\\({h}_{t-1}\\), \\({x}_{t}\\) denote the current state, the previous state and the input state, respectively. \\({W}_{hh}\\) is the weight of the recurrent neuron and the input neuron is indicated by\\({W}_{xh}\\). Similarly, in Eq. (3) \\({y}_{t}\\) indicates the output state and the output with weight is denoted by\\({W}_{hy}\\). The structure of the RNN architecture is shown in Fig. 11.\n\nFig. 11 Working of CNN Full size image\n\nConvolution neural network (CNN)\n\nCNN has been implemented in pattern recognition and is also used in the image recognition process by applying deep learning techniques to carry out generative and descriptive tasks with the help of computer vision and NLP techniques. CNN work is based on neurons, which boosts image processing, and the layers in neurons pave the way to consider the entire image and avoid piece-wise image processing. The convolution layers carry out feature extraction from the input images and form a feature map of neurons. Figure 12 shows the structure of CNN.",

            "content": "Under the weight of sweeping antitrust enforcement and intense competition for AI turf, Alphabet stock (GOOG, GOOGL) is enjoying a December resurgence. No Big Tech platform has risen so much this late in the year. And aside from Tesla (TSLA), shares of the Google parent are outshining the rest of the Magnificent Seven, rising 14% this month.\n\nBack-to-back catalysts \u2014 from a quantum computing breakthrough to the demise of a chief rival in the robotaxi market \u2014 lifted shares in the final weeks of 2024. They punctuated a year defined not so much by transformation but by rediscovery.\n\n\u201cThe stock market rewards mystery and open-ended opportunities and Alphabet still has its mojo \u2014 the recent announcements were a reminder of that,\u201d said Michael Smith, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.\n\nBy the numbers, even Google\u2019s 40% year-to-date gains fall below the Magnificent Seven average of about 64%. The company\u2019s stock price growth is well behind the chart-topping appreciation of Nvidia (NVDA), Meta's (META) powerful comeback story, and Tesla\u2019s post-election Trump bump. But the gap between Google\u2019s share price gain and those of the best-performing tech companies is partly why analysts see buying opportunities.\n\nGoogle\u2019s end-of-year rally also highlights changing perceptions of the company. Where earlier this year Google was still seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI in the burgeoning market for AI tools, Mountain View has since worked to even the playing field.\n\n\u201cPeople have been worried about the innovator\u2019s dilemma affecting Google\u2019s commitment to staying on the right side of change,\u201d said Smith. \u201cMore recently, it is clear that Google has the capabilities to stay at the front of the industry.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s AI Overviews, the company\u2019s most public-facing AI offering, represented an overhaul of its core search product. And while questions still remain about how well the company can monetize AI-inflected search without cannibalizing its proven business model, CEO Sundar Pichai has said that AI Overviews has led to increased user engagement.\n\n\u201cIf we get more confirmation that AI accelerates search growth, that would represent a major change to consensus thinking and lead to more upside for Google shares,\u201d said Smith.\n\nOpenAI might still have a first-mover advantage in generative AI, said Hanna Howard, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. But maintaining that edge over a longer period is challenging as large-scale, well-capitalized players like Google spend meaningfully to develop their own AI capabilities.\n\nStory Continues",
