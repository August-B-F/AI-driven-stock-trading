They're our choice for the best headphones on the market and they're on sale for an incredible price of $249. Currently, the discount applies to the Silver and Smoky Pink colorways, as the other two colors have jumped back up to $328. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399 now $249 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Amazon) Amazon's Big Spring Sale has officially started! The first deal that jumped out at me this morning is this one on the Kindle Colorsoft. Our Kindle Colorsoft review said its gorgeous color display, comfortable design and super-long battery life make it an all-around winner. While it's a little pricy at its MSRP of $279, that's less of an issue after a discount. Kindle Colorsoft: was $279 now $224 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Future) Earlier I mentioned that there's a bunch of Fire TV Sticks on sale right now. Well, there's also a handful of Amazon Echo deals you can grab right now. Tom's Guide deals writer Olivia Halevy has picked out the best deals via the link above. It's worth nothing that the Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21 are not part of the sale. The reason I highlight those models is because Amazon has stated that they'll be the first to get access to Alexa Plus, when that rolls out later this spring. However, there's a chance we may see one of multiple of them on sale later this week. Stay tuned! Amazon Echo deals: from $29 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Skechers) Amazon has Skechers sales pretty much every week. Today's sale is not that much different than other sales we've seen with one exception \u2014 I'm seeing a lot more Skecher styles on sale. So while prices are on par with the last Skechers sale we saw earlier this month, today's sale does offer notably more deals. Remember, prices vary based on your choice of size and color, so check any different color options in your size to find the best deals. Skechers sale: deals from $20 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Ninja) There's a handful of Ninja appliances in my household. I have a Ninja coffee maker, blender, and all-in-one air fryer. I'm a Ninja fan because their products tend to be affordable, versatile and high-quality. They also happen to make some of the best kitchen appliances we've ever tested \u2014 many of which are currently sporting epic discounts at Amazon. Even the Ninja Thirsti 24-oz. Tumbler is on sale for $29. Ninja sale: deals from $53 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Amazon) I'm a big Apple user. In addition to the Mac mini, I also have an iPad mini, Apple Watch, and MacBook Air. My one rule when buying Apple devices is this \u2014 never pay full price. There's always an Apple sale to be found and with the Amazon Big Spring Sale in full swing, deals writer Olivia Halevy has rounded up all of the best Amazon Big Spring Sale Apple deals you can get right now. It's especially cool to see aggressive deals on the new M4-based MacBook Airs and the new iPads. Check out her roundup via the link above or dive head-first into the sale via the link below. Apple sale: save on MacBook Air M4, Mac mini M4, AirPods and more @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: DEWALT) When it comes to deals on power tools, Amazon isn't the first store that comes to mind. Retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's tend to undercut Amazon on both pricing and variety. But right now Amazon has select DeWalt power tools and accessories on sale from $14. To be fair, Amazon has offered DeWalt power tools deals before, but this is one of the largest I've seen in years. The sale includes cordless drills, accessories, storage and more. DeWalt: deals from $14 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Amazon) Spring is here and whether you're exercising outdoors or at the gym, a Stanley tumbler can make sure you stay hydrated all the time. Right now Amazon has dozens of Stanley tumblers on sale from $22. There are various colors and sizes to choose from. I'm personally liking the colors on this Stanley All-Day Slim Bottle for $27. Stanley sale: deals from $22 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Samsung) I'm not a PC gamer, but Tom's Guide senior computing writer Tony Polanco is and when he recommends something \u2014 you should listen. He's reviewed some of the best gaming monitors and one of his favorite displays is on sale. Right now the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is $700 off as part of the Amazon Big Spring Sale. This is the second-lowest price we've seen for this monitor (it hit $1,002 earlier this year) and it's a killer deal for a monitor that Tony says is amazing for gaming, but just as impressive for multitasking and boosting productivity, too. Samsung 49\" Odyssey OLED G9: was $1,799 now $1,099 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Future / Millie Fender) I don't own a Nespresso machine right now, but I used to and I miss it 100%. Nespresso machines can brew a cup of a coffee in a matter of seconds. Even better, clean-up is easy since all you need to do is discard of the used Nespresso pod. Right now Amazon has multiple Nespresso machines on sale from $99. It's one of the lowest prices I've seen in recent months. Additionally, Amazon has Nespresso capsule/bundles on sale at 10% off when you opt for subscribe & save. That's especially rare as the capsules usually don't undergo any discounts. Not sure which model to buy? Check out our guide to the best Nespresso machines. Nespresso machines: deals from $99\n\nNespresso capsules: deals from $35\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide) Hey everyone! I'm Louis \u2014 deals editor-in-chief at Tom's Guide and I'm taking over the live blog for the next few hours. Ok, so Amazon's sale officially starts tomorrow, but there are hundreds of deals you can get now. Yes, some deals are mediocre, but I'm seeing a lot of good ones this morning so my first post on this live blog is for a device I personally own/use. Right now the Mac mini M4 is on sale for $529. I'm writing this on my Mac Mini M4 Pro and it's hands-down the best computer I've ever used. (It's certainly the best mini PC). I bought mine late last year, so I've been using it for about 3 months now. I opted for the M4 Pro and it's smooth like butter. Even when I have 50+ browser tabs open while editing a photo and streaming a 4K YouTube video, the Mac mini doesn't break a sweat. In our Mac mini M4 review we said even the base model is supercharged. As far as price, it hit $499 a few times last year during Cyber Monday, so this isn't the lowest price. But even at $529 \u2014 which is it's second lowest price ever \u2014 it's an epic steal. Btw, the M4 Pro model is just $10 shy of it's all-time price low. I recommend it a thousand times over. Mac mini M4: was $599 now $529 @ Amazon\n\nMac mini M4 Pro: was $1,399 now $1,299 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Amazon) The Blink Mini 2 is a super cheap way to give your home security setup a boost. It's on sale for just $19, which is its lowest price ever and a total steal. Our Blink Mini 2 review said this device was \"mini but mighty,\" and we loved that it delivered color night vision and person detection. It's even weatherproof, so you can use it indoors or out. Blink Mini 2: was $39 now $19 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Future) Android users, there's a great smartwatch deal up for grabs for you too. Right now you can get the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 on sale for $229 at Amazon, which is an awesome $70 off. It takes the number two spot on our list of the best smartwatches due to its impressive sleep tracking features and comfortable design. It also has longer battery life than the Apple Watch 10, clocking in at 24 hours using the always-on display, or up to 40 hours in power-save mode. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (GPS/40mm): was $299 now $229 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Future) Haven't picked up the latest Apple Watch yet? Now's the time for an upgrade, as the Apple Watch 10 is now on sale for a massive $100 discount. We rank it as the best smartwatch on the market because of its super bright display, excellent design that's comfortable and lightweight and suite of useful health tracking features. Apple Watch 10 (GPS/42mm): was $399 now $299 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide) Amazon is offering an epic discount on our new best laptop. Apple just released this upgraded MacBook Air and it's already on sale for $50 off, which is awesome to see. Our MacBook Air M4 review said it delivered incredible performance across the board, and it can handle pretty much all computing tasks with ease. MacBook Air 13\" (M4/16GB/256GB): was $999 now $949 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Amazon) I can't go any longer without mentioning one of my favorite OLED TV deals. Right now Amazon has LG C4 OLED TVs on sale from $896, which matches the lowest ever starting price for this model. LG'c C4 series is a consistent best seller in sales events like this, and it earned a 4/5 star rating in our LG C4 OLED review. LG C4 4K OLED TV sale: deals from $896 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Fitbit) Another stellar deal is this one on the Fitbit Inspire 3. We rank it as the best fitness tracker for shoppers on a budget, and that was when it was at its usual price of $99. It's now gotten even cheaper, so make sure you don't miss out. Fitbit Inspire 3: was $99 now $69 @ Amazon\n\n(Image credit: Future) This is one of the best headphone deals I've seen so far this year! Right now you can get the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones on sale for $249 at Amazon, which is a new all-time low price. They're our choice for the best headphones on the market right now, and I've gushed about how great they are in the article I've linked below. The Sony WH-1000XM5 just hit a record low price at Amazon \u2014 this is incredible",

You\u2019ll now find the new Amazon Kindle Colorsoft down at $224.99 shipped from the regular $280 list price to deliver the best deal we have tracked since its release last fall as part of the latest slate of new Kindles.\n\nWe have only seen a couple of chances to save on the new Colorsoft since its debut, both of which landed the new color tablet at its previous low of $230. Today\u2019s deal, however, is taking things down a notch further to deliver a new all-time low as part of the Big Spring Sale.\n\nThe Kindle Colorsoft is the very first model to feature a color display. It debuted alongside the the \u201creimagined\u201d Kindle Scribe and the fastest Paperwhite model ever back in October 2024 \u2013 both of these models are also now on sale for the Big Spring Sale event as well.\n\nThe Colorsoft was, for many, the real headliner model in the new lineup, delivering the first Kindle reader with a color display \u2013 you can now browse book covers in full color on both the Kindle store and within your personal library, not to mention full color book photos and images alongside the ability to \u201cadd color highlights that you can easily search later.\u201d\n\nIt comes equipped with an oxide backplane-equipped 7-inch display said to deliver a higher-contract viewing experience in both black and white and full color elements \u2013 \u201chigh contrast, fast page turns, an auto-adjusting front light, and weeks of battery life.\u201d The 8 weeks of battery life and waterproof design join the usual instant access to \u201cover 15 million titles in the Kindle Store worldwide.\u201d\n\nA complete rundown of all the new Kindle models is at the ready in our launch coverage right here.\n\nKindle Colorsoft features:\n\nRead in color \u2013 The new 7\u2033 Colorsoft display is high-contrast and easy on the eyes, with paper-like color that brings covers and content to life.\n\nColor your pages \u2013 Highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, and pink.\n\nMarathon reading \u2013 A single charge via USB-C lasts up to 8 weeks, or power up with the wireless charging dock (sold separately).\n\nAdapts to your surroundings \u2013 The glare-free display and auto-adjusting front light let you read in the brightest sunlight or late into the night.\n\nWaterproof and worry-free \u2013 Take your stories by the pool, in the bath, or anywhere in between.\n\nMassive selection \u2013 Instantly access over 15 million titles in the Kindle Store worldwide, and add a Kindle Unlimited subscription for all-you-can read access to a catalog including best sellers.\n\nA brand-new experience \u2013 The Kindle Colorsoft display is optimized for reading in color and is different from the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading.\n\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\n\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!",

Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale runs from March 25 to March 31. With no other big sale events in view, this could be a good time to snag that mesh router, set of headphones, or robo vac you\u2019ve had your eye on. As usual, Amazon has discounts on all sorts of stuff, but many deals are exclusive to Amazon Prime members.\n\nNow, we\u2019re not suggesting you harvest this spring deal crop indiscriminately; we are here to help you sort the wheat from the chaff. The WIRED Gear team has run its many eyes over the list to tease out deals that are for gadgets worth owning and actually deals.

Amazon\u2019s Eero makes some of our favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check our Eero buying guide to decide which is best for your home. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nDJI\u2019s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI\u2019s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it\u2019s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nBuilt to last, this braided nylon cable\u2019s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the best USB-C cables for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is our favorite budget option in our guide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn\u2019t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren\u2019t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via the Razer Synapse app. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nThis Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there\u2019s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There\u2019s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. It\u2019s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Ugreen\n\nUgreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your carry-on. It\u2019s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nA classic among podcasters and gamers, the Blue Yeti is a great-sounding microphone that suits virtually every need you\u2019ll have. A steep discount makes this a must-buy for anyone who is mic shopping this spring, given that these usually retail for well over $100. I like that these have physical controls on the microphone, which makes it easy to mute and adjust volume on the fly. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nI hate using clip-on reading lights because I always feel like they\u2019re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It\u2019s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions\u2014once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You\u2019ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother 120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Amazon Device Deals\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nWhen Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids\u2019 versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you\u2019re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It\u2019s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThis is the best Kindle (8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and a Premium Pen that has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you\u2019re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes). \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon\u2019s standard Fire tablets, but you\u2019ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you\u2019re covered. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe Fire HD 10 Pro Kid\u2019s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon\u2019s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Deals\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nThis cute little smart plug works with every smart home speaker you could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won\u2019t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It\u2019s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it\u2019ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It\u2019s got a nice small form factor so you won\u2019t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It\u2019s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I\u2019ve tried, and at $18, it\u2019s one of the lowest prices we\u2019ve seen for it this year. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nTushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom\u2014renters included\u2014since it\u2019s a small accessory that doesn\u2019t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it\u2019s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom\u2019s vibe. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nPhotograph: Dyson\n\nThis excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn\u2019t go on sale super often). It\u2019s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might\u2019ve missed otherwise. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It\u2019s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn\u2019t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson\u2019s offering. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nTrue Classic\u2019s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the \u201cdad bod\u201d fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he\u2019d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it\u2019s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it\u2019s a solid tee that won\u2019t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nDyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I\u2019d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that\u2019ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It\u2019s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it\u2019s also the most sophisticated air management system I\u2019ve tested. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nWe are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). \u2014Adrienne So\n\nYeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price\u2014the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nTineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets\u2014I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this\u2014including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it\u2019s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you\u2019re in. There\u2019s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it\u2019s brand-new. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThis family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it\u2019s so easy to pick up and play, and it\u2019s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It\u2019s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don\u2019t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Office Deals\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it\u2019s put together, it\u2019s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nI love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I\u2019ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak\u2019s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There\u2019s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Kitchen Deals\n\nPhotograph: Andrew Watman\n\nAny ol\u2019 carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can\u2019t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to \u201chydrate\u201d or fill you with energy. Anyway, it\u2019s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nWIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator\u2019s fast mode\u2014so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine\u2019s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It\u2019s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general\u2014I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you\u2019re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Aucma\n\nLook, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that\u2019ll bother some batter, and you don\u2019t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville\u2019s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It\u2019s one I\u2019ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn\u2019t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Aeropress\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you\u2019ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it\u2019s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I\u2019ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED\u2019s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we\u2019ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we\u2019ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don\u2019t beep\u2014the simple dial keeps things quiet.\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Beauty Deals\n\nPhotograph: Chi\n\nThis is the original \u201cupgrade\u201d hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it\u2019s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn\u2019t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you\u2019ll find for $50. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThis consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it\u2019s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you\u2019d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming\u2014the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you\u2019d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Philips\n\nIf oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you\u2019re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it\u2019s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you\u2019ve been brushing and will remind you when it\u2019s time to replace the head. Normally $50\u2014now $40\u2014this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we\u2019ve tested. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nIf you\u2019re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it\u2019s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won\u2019t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it\u2019s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it\u2019s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nManscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer\u2019s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn\u2019t the lowest price we\u2019ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it\u2019s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn\u2019t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you\u2019re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you\u2019re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nIf TikTok\u2019s raving about it, I\u2019m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid\u2014but don\u2019t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it\u2019s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we\u2019ve seen the price dip lower before. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThese cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It\u2019s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it\u2019s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I\u2019m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nMicellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It\u2019s me, I\u2019m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don\u2019t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it\u2019s affordable and easy to find (and I don\u2019t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Withings\n\nThis topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you\u2019re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nAfina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Mobile Phone Deals (Plus Accessories)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we\u2019ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier\u2014including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we\u2019ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don\u2019t forget a case! \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThe best smart display to invest in isn\u2019t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren\u2019t using the tablet. It\u2019s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you\u2019re able to use it all day long. It\u2019s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nIt has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung\u2019s latest smartwatch. It\u2019s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying\u2014it\u2019ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it\u2019s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nTesting Google\u2019s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said \u201cround is better than square.\u201d It\u2019s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google\u2019s integration with it is virtually perfect. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nWant a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life\u2014extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest TV Deals (Plus Streaming Devices)\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThis tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it\u2019s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you\u2019re not watching shows and movies. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nBest Speaker Deals\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBeats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill\u2019s stylish frame isn\u2019t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThese perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that\u2019s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nUltimate Ears\u2019 Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it\u2019s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears\u2019 app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you\u2019re ready to grab your next patio companion now\u2019s a good time. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you\u2019re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis isn\u2019t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it\u2019s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Headphone Deals\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThese cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you\u2019re after a pair that look good and that you don\u2019t need to worry about, start here. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nIf you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nSoundcore\u2019s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren\u2019t just another AirPods clone. They\u2019re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you\u2019ll pay for Apple\u2019s best buds. You\u2019re not getting Apple\u2019s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore\u2019s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it\u2019s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony\n\nWe see this discount frequently, but we\u2019d be remiss not to include it here since it\u2019s the best deal we see for the best headphones we\u2019ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).\u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They\u2019re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take \u2019em to the gym. It\u2019s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don\u2019t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.\u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nA sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I\u2019ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I\u2019ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don\u2019t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they\u2019re a guilt-free budget buy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you\u2019re an Apple user who doesn\u2019t want to spend $250, then Beats\u2019 previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them \u201cApple\u2019s best earbuds ever.\u201d) They\u2019re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nIf I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company\u2019s models, whether it\u2019s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don\u2019t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBose isn\u2019t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we\u2019ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we\u2019ve seen, so if you\u2019re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now\u2019s a good time. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They\u2019re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they\u2019ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn\u2019t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they\u2019re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it\u2019s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It\u2019s bulkier than other cases I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It\u2019s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Pet Deals\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nThe Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic.

(She especially knows this.) \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nA top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThe Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats\u2019 usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells \u2026 good? At $430, this is the lowest price we\u2019ve ever seen it. But I\u2019d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat\u2019s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThis fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We\u2019ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it\u2019s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats\u2019 well-being. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Outdoor Deals\n\nPhotograph: Birdfy\n\nAs we\u2019ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)\u2014every model we\u2019ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn\u2019t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won\u2019t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nDespite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy\u2019s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder\u2019s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Repel\n\nThe Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it\u2019s open. There\u2019s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You\u2019ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it\u2019s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there\u2019s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It\u2019s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals",

There are also a number of discounts on brands NBC Select editors have tested and loved in the past, like Ninja and JBL.\n\nThe sale runs from March 25 through March 31 and both Prime and non-Prime members can shop. While it doesn\u2019t have quite as many deep discounts as Amazon Prime Day, there are still a number of on-sale items I found that I think are actually worth checking out. To zero in on the best offerings, I combed through dozens of deal pages and looked for brands NBC Select has covered in the past, deals that are at least 20% off and highly rated items that have at least a 4-star average from hundreds of reviews.\n\nAmazon will drop new deals throughout the entirety of the sale so I\u2019ll be updating this page over the next few days with additional offers.

It's a seven-day sale, with deals focused on seasonal items, from winter- and spring-like apparel, to travel, sports, furniture, gardening, lawn, grilling, storage, and bedding supplies. And, of course, tech, which is good for any season. This is only the second time Amazon has run a spring sale, after debuting it in 2024\n\nWhen is Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nAmazon announced its Big Spring Sale will run for a full week, from March 25 through March 31, 2025.\n\nDo you need to be a Prime Member to shop for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nYou do not need to be a Prime Member to shop Amazon's Big Spring Sale. However, Prime Members will get more and better deals, according to Amazon. Prime membership starts at $14.99 per month. You can calculate whether a yearly Prime membership is worth it for you , but remember that you can always cancel your Prime membership once the sale is over\u2014Amazon offers free 30-day trials , so you can shop the whole week of the event and cancel before making a subscription payment. (Read about how to sign up for a Prime account here .)\n\nWhat can you expect for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nBecause the Big Spring Sale happens in the spring, you're going to see end-of-season deals from Amazon outlet stores on winter items, but also on upcoming spring products. The deals seem to top out at 40% off. Here is an idea of what you can expect:\n\nUp to 40% off select outdoor furniture and gardening supplies\n\nUp to 35% off select lawn and grilling equipment\n\nUp to 35% off select home storage and bedding\n\nUp to 40% off select apparel and beauty\n\nUp to 40% off select sports and travel essentials\n\nThere will be \"daily themes\" for each day of the sale, and whatever the theme is for that day is where you can expect to find the best deals. We'll also be publishing the best deals we find all week, so make sure to keep tabs on our deals page throughout the sale.\n\nWhat do you think so far? Post a comment.\n\nEarly Big Spring Sale deals are already live\n\nAs is usually the case, Amazon kicks off its sales with some early deals that lead up to the main event. (Keep in mind that these aren't technically Big Spring Sale deals, though\u2014you'll know if a deal is part of the sale by the \"Prime Spring Deal\" badge on the product page, which will only appear once the sale has officially started.\n\nWill there be competing sales at other retalers?\n\nYes. Target announced its Circle Week event plans, which started on March 23 and run until March 29. Walmart is also promoting Super Savings Week from March 24 through Tuesday, April 1.\n\nSome tips for saving during Amazon's Big Spring Sale\n\nIf this will be your first time shopping an Amazon sale, there are some basic things you need to know.",

            "content": "The Amazon Big Spring Sale is here and, like last year, the discounts appear to be more focused on kitchen, fashion and decor. Those last two categories don\u2019t really apply to what we cover here at Engadget. Cooking gear, however, is getting more tech-reliant and the intersection of food and tech is a place we feel very comfortable. We\u2019ve reviewed Instant Pots, air fryers, coffee gear, sous vide machines and more. Lots of what we recommend is now on sale for Amazon\u2019s latest sale. Read on for the best deals on kitchen tech we could find.\n\nWe named this the best air fryer overall in our guide (I bought one myself and use it daily). It preheats quickly and the included filters really do tamp down the cooking odors. The non-stick basket is easy to clean and the window lets you keep an eye on your food as it heats. This represents a 47 percent discount and the best price we've seen all year.\n\nCosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off): Cosori\u2019s fryer earned a spot as the runner up for best overall air fryer in our guide. It has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity. We like that it doesn\u2019t take up too much space, but can still cook up a decent amount of food\n\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $320 ($80 off): If you want a more traditional toaster oven design with a huge capacity, go for our premium air fryer pick. The fryer-and-oven combo can accommodate a five-quart dutch oven, so it\u2019s almost an auxiliary oven, which could come in handy when you\u2019re cooking for a crowd.\n\nBreville the Smart Oven Air Fryer for $280 ($70 off): This is the non-Pro version of the Breville air fryer we recommend. It has a slightly smaller capacity (0.8 cubic feet instead of one cubic foot) and is missing two cooking functions (dehydrate and proof). But if you\u2019re not making your own jerky or baking a ton of bread, this one can toast, broil, air fry and slow cook. You can even get it in cool colors like Red Velvet Cake for the same price.\n\nNinja DZ401 Foodi 10-quart air fryer for $190 ($40 off): If you need to air fry two different foods at once, go for our recommendation for a dual-zone air fryer. It\u2019s a beast, so we think it\u2019s best for larger kitchens and people who make big meals. It went as low as $130 for Black Friday last year, but this is the cheapest price we\u2019ve seen since then.\n\nInstant Vortex 2QT Mini Air Fryer for $50 ($10 off): The budget pick in our guide doesn\u2019t go on sale often \u2014 it\u2019s already pretty cheap at its $60 list price. It\u2019s sold for as little as $48 for Prime Day in July, but this is the cheapest we\u2019ve seen since then. Its two-quart capacity is probably best for small kitchens and can crisp up food for one or two people.\n\nInstant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $90 $40 off): We like this Instant Pot model because it's simple to use and has several quick-cooking modes including beans, cake, sous vide and more. It went as low as $70 earlier this year, but this is still a 30 percent discount off the list price.\n\nInstant Pot Pro Plus 9-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker for $140 ($60 off): We also suggest this fancier Pro Plus model in our guide to kitchen tech. It\u2019s a Wi-Fi connected unit with a canning function and you can even release the steam remotely using the companion app \u2014 which has over 800 recipes. This matches the lowest price we saw earlier this year, but is still a bit more than its $99 all-time low.\n\nNinja AF150AMZ Air Fryer for $120 (25 percent off): This went as low as $100 for the holidays last year, but this matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen since then. The fryer gets an honorable mention in our air fryer guide because it makes good use of limited counter space with its taller design. The round cooking basket doesn\u2019t feel as roomy as square ones but it does have a dehydrate option that other cookers don\u2019t come with.\n\nAnova Culinary Sous Vide 3.0 for $129 ($70 off): We named this the best overall sous vide machine after testing a number of models for our buyer\u2019s guide. This is about $30 more than the low it hit for the holidays last year, but this is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen in 2025. We appreciate the easy digital controls and found that the high flow rate maintains water temperature better than other machines. Plus, if you\u2019re at a loss for what to cook, you can check out the companion app which is replete with recipes.\n\nCosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off): This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP.\n\nFellow Stagg EKG Pro electric kettle for $165 ($30 off): This exquisitely designed kettle has an LCD panel built into the base so you can choose a specific temperature down to the degree. And the hold feature keeps water hot for up to an hour. This is the pro model of the version we recommend in our tea guide.\n\nNinja SS101 Foodi Smoothie Maker for $80 ($40 off): Engadget\u2019s Vallentina Palladino recommends this smoothie blender in our gift guide for cooks saying it doesn\u2019t take up that much space and the swappable lids make it easy to take one\u2019s health shakes on the go. This isn\u2019t an all-time low but matches the cheapest price we\u2019ve seen since 2023 when it sold for $50.\n\nKitchenAid Artisan 5-quart stand mixer for $380 ($80 off): Small wonder that the home cook\u2019s gold standard of mixers made its way onto our kitchen tech guide. Its ton of available attachments can be used to make pasta, grind food, strain or spiralize fruits and veggies and more. This is no unitasker. This is a solid $80 discount off of the MSRP, but we\u2019ll note that Amazon sold it for as low as $330 at the end of last year and for $350 last month.\n\nKitchenAid Go Cordless Hand Blender for $100 ($30 off): The big selling point here is the removable battery that you can use for other KitchenAid Go appliances. In our testing, it had enough power to turn a roasted butternut squash into a smooth, creamy soup. The blender has hit this price a few times over the past few months and the deal isn\u2019t as good as the $77 it sold for at the end of last year.\n\nCosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $60 ($10 off): This kettle earned a spot in our list of favorite small kitchen appliances. It has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks and an elegant gooseneck pour. This is a price it has hit many times before, but is a chance to save $10 over the usual MSRP.",

It's a seven-day sale, with deals focused on seasonal items, from winter- and spring-like apparel, to travel, sports, furniture, gardening, lawn, grilling, storage, and bedding supplies. And, of course, tech, which is good for any season. This is only the second time Amazon has run a spring sale, after debuting it in 2024\n\nWhen is Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nAmazon announced its Big Spring Sale will run for a full week, from March 25 through March 31, 2025.\n\nDo you need to be a Prime Member to shop for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nYou do not need to be a Prime Member to shop Amazon's Big Spring Sale. However, Prime Members will get more and better deals, according to Amazon. Prime membership starts at $14.99 per month. You can calculate whether a yearly Prime membership is worth it for you , but remember that you can always cancel your Prime membership once the sale is over\u2014Amazon offers free 30-day trials , so you can shop the whole week of the event and cancel before making a subscription payment. (Read about how to sign up for a Prime account here .)\n\nWhat can you expect for Amazon's Big Spring Sale?\n\nBecause the Big Spring Sale happens in the spring, you're going to see end-of-season deals from Amazon outlet stores on winter items, but also on upcoming spring products. The deals seem to top out at 40% off. Here is an idea of what you can expect:\n\nUp to 40% off select outdoor furniture and gardening supplies\n\nUp to 35% off select lawn and grilling equipment\n\nUp to 35% off select home storage and bedding\n\nUp to 40% off select apparel and beauty\n\nUp to 40% off select sports and travel essentials\n\nThere will be \"daily themes\" for each day of the sale, and whatever the theme is for that day is where you can expect to find the best deals. We'll also be publishing the best deals we find all week, so make sure to keep tabs on our deals page throughout the sale.\n\nWhat do you think so far? Post a comment.\n\nEarly Big Spring Sale deals are already live\n\nAs is usually the case, Amazon kicks off its sales with some early deals that lead up to the main event. (Keep in mind that these aren't technically Big Spring Sale deals, though\u2014you'll know if a deal is part of the sale by the \"Prime Spring Deal\" badge on the product page, which will only appear once the sale has officially started.\n\nWill there be competing sales at other retalers?\n\nYes. Target announced its Circle Week event plans, which started on March 23 and run until March 29. Walmart is also promoting Super Savings Week from March 24 through Tuesday, April 1.\n\nSome tips for saving during Amazon's Big Spring Sale\n\nIf this will be your first time shopping an Amazon sale, there are some basic things you need to know.",

            "content": "Adam Breeden/ZDNET\n\nWhen is Amazon's Spring Sale 2025?\n\nAmazon confirmed its second annual Big Spring Sale event on March 18, and publicly unveiled that the sale begins on Tuesday, March 25 and will end on Monday, March 31.\n\nAlso: Everything you need to know about Amazon's Big Spring Sale 2025\n\nDo I have to be a Prime member to shop Amazon's Spring Sale?\n\nNo, you don't have to be a Prime member to shop this sale event. All customers can shop the Amazon Big Spring Sale, although, like last year, Prime members will presumably have special access to select exclusive deals. If you're not a Prime member yet, you can join before the Big Spring Sale kickoff to receive member benefits like free shipping, entertainment, exclusive savings, and more.\n\nHow much is an Amazon Prime membership?\n\nAmazon Prime costs $15 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, saving several dollars. College students and those aged 18-24 can get a discount and pay nearly $8 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership for just $7 per month after their free trial.\n\nHow can I maximize the Spring Sale to save?\n\nAs a commerce and advice editor, I can recommend a few things to help you maximize Amazon's sales. If you want to shop the sale, you'll want to access a Prime account, even if the Big Spring Sale is not a Prime-exclusive event. In addition to free two-day shipping, membership is easy to set up and gives you access to exclusive offers on the site. Plus, you can use a free trial to shop for the best savings without spending a dime on a membership.\n\nIf you end up starting a free trial (or already have Prime), ensure your payment options (like one-click settings and your default delivery address) are correct. This way, you can check out quickly if you need to during the sale. Other ways to prepare for spring savings include researching and planning potential purchases, listing want and need items, and setting a budget before sales.\n\nHow did we choose these Spring Sale deals?\n\nZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.\n\nWe also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.\n\nWhat are the best Amazon Spring Sale 2025 deals?\n\nZDNET's experts are searching through Amazon's Spring Sale deals to find the best discounts by category. These are the best deals so far:\n\nYou can also find the best Amazon Spring Sale deals by price:\n\nAnd the best deals from other retailers this week:\n\nLooking for the next best product?

From sought-after tech and smart home gear to EVs, smartphone accessories, spring cleaning products, and a whole lot more, the deals will be flying starting today and we will be here to uncover the best of them.\n\nAmazon Big Spring Sale goes live today\n\nUnlike Amazon Prime Day events, the Big Spring Sale is (mostly) open to everyone, with or without a Prime membership. But, like the Prime Day events, there will be tons of deals up for grabs nonetheless.\n\nThat said, and as you\u2019ll know from our launch coverage of this year\u2019s event, Amazon has announced that some deals will be marked with a \u201cPrime Spring Deal\u201d badge \u2013 these deals will only be available to paid Amazon Prime members. We are very much expecting many of these offers to be among the particular highlights, but just as we have seen from past sale event like this, just about anything can happen on any item as Amazon might very well start throwing around bonus on-page coupons throughout the event to sweeten the deals even further.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to pay close attention to the 9to5Toys home page and our social feeds for up-to-the-minute price drops.\n\nAll of the Amazon Big Spring Sale deals are set to officially go live today, March 25 at 3 a.m. ET and carry through until month\u2019s end. But, as you\u2019ll see below, there are already some deals live right now and it will only be a matter of a few hours before the Big Spring Sale takes over the Amazon home page and quickly fills up with thousands of price drops.\n\nWe of course will be working around the clock to surface the most notable discounts across a broad range of product categories, and we have very much already started. Like other major holiday sale events at Amazon, there are plenty of early deals already live and we will leave you with some particular highlights here before getting into some previews of today\u2019s offers below.\n\nAs per usual, some of the major in-house Amazon gear is already marked down, but we are also tracking early deals on the Eve smart home eco system, a series of Apple products, and more:\n\nIt is also worth noting that Amazon has a host of early deals live on everything from outlet items and apparel to Easter deals for the kids and everyday essentials and groceries at under $25. You\u2019ll find all of those on this landing page.\n\nAgain, make sure you stay locked to 9to5Toys all weeklong as we work around the clock to deliver the best deals of the season from Amazon and elsewhere.\n\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\n\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!",

There were some impressive new features and demos of the upgraded Amazon AI assistant \u2013 \u201cnatural, flowing conversations,\u201d the new Alexicons, third-party AI integrations, the ability to handle far more complicated commands, and a whole lot more detailed right here. While at the time it seemed as though Alexa+ would only be supported on Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21, many of the smart Amazon speakers and displays now carry a \u201cThis device works with Alexa+\u201d badge, and a bunch of them are also now on sale ahead of the Big Spring Sale set to kick off on Tuesday. The details and deals await below.\n\nAlexa+ smart speaker deals:\n\nAlexa+ smart display deals:\n\nWhen Amazon debuted the new Alexa+, it only mentioned \u201csupport for Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21.\u201d And while complete functionality, like access to Amazon ecosystem smart camera features for example, might only be available on these smart display models, all of the gear mentioned above now contains the works with Alexa+ badge.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that we are on the horizon of the Big Spring Sale at Amazon and we have seen just about all of these models go for less in the past. Amazon does tend to put the deals on its in-house gear up ahead of the big events like they are today, and in a post-Alexa+ world it\u2019s hard to say whether or not we will be seeing deals quite as low as we did for Black Friday last year or not at this point.\n\nAmazon Echo hub features:\n\nEcho Hub \u2014 An easy-to-use Alexa-enabled control panel for your smart home devices\u2014just ask Alexa or tap the display to control lights, smart plugs, camera feeds, and more.\n\nStreamline your smart home \u2014 Customize the controls and widgets, displayed on your dashboard to quickly adjust devices, view cameras, start routines, and more.\n\nWorks with thousands of Alexa compatible devices \u2014 Compatible with thousands of connected locks, thermostats, speakers, and more.

            "content": "With Amazon (AMZN 3.58%) shares down 11% since the start of the year, a lot of investors are wondering if it's time to buy the dip. Like many tech stocks, the diversified e-commerce giant has been hit by a souring macroeconomic outlook and possible generative artificial intelligence (AI) fatigue. Let's explore what the next 12 months could have in store.\n\nBusiness is still booming\n\nAmazon is a massive $2.04 trillion company and it isn't done growing yet. Fourth-quarter net sales jumped 10% year over year to $187.8 billion. And while that may seem like a small growth rate, we are talking about hundreds of billions here in annual sales. Its recent top-line growth was mainly powered by a strong showing from its North American e-commerce unit, which had a particularly successful holiday shopping season.\n\nAmazon's bottom line also continues to flourish in the post-pandemic economy. It has been about four years since CEO Andrew Jassy took the helm and shifted away from the growth-at-all-costs strategy of his predecessor, Jeff Bezos, to prioritize profitability. Jassy's approach helped Amazon expand operating income by 61% year over year to $21.2 billion in Q4, with the cloud computing division, AWS, contributing around half of the total.\n\nManagement is not yet finished cutting costs. On the heels of other large layoffs, Amazon intends to eliminate close to 14,000 managerial positions this year, which analysts at Morgan Stanley predict could save it between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually.\n\nNew growth drivers\n\nAmazon isn't cutting costs from a position of weakness. It also enjoys long-term growth drivers like AI. The company plays a middleman role in the cloud infrastructure side of the opportunity, essentially accumulating hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia to power its massive data centers, and renting out this processing power to the software companies creating AI applications.\n\nManagement plans to expand Amazon's role in ways that will somewhat encroach on Nvidia's territory. This month, it announced plans to offer discounted access to servers powered by its custom-made AI chip, Trainium, which is designed to train generative AI large language models (LLMs).\n\nAccording to online news outlet The Information, these chips match the performance of Nvidia's H100 GPUs at about a quarter of the cost. And while Nvidia has moved on from its Hopper (H) architecture to its more advanced Blackwell-based chips, Amazon still looks poised to capture a share of the AI chip market.\n\nAI-related demand helped power the growth of AWS in the fourth quarter. This segment is vital for Amazon because it boasts significantly higher margins than e-commerce.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges?\n\nAmazon's first-quarter guidance had a little red flag. While management expects top-line growth of between 5% and 9%, they also anticipate an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact of $2.1 billion on its sales. This may reflect increasing volatility in foreign exchange markets due to President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade policy, which have led to retaliatory tariffs, boycotts, and fears of a trade war.\n\nFurthermore, JP Morgan's chief global economist now sees a 40% chance that the U.S. will fall into a recession this year. As a multinational company that operates significantly in the consumer goods space, Amazon looks especially vulnerable to these types of headwinds. During an economic downturn, consumers are likely to pull back on discretionary spending, and may shift more of their shopping to Amazon's discount retail rivals like Walmart, which focuses more on essential goods.\n\nWhere will Amazon be in 1 year?\n\nOver the long term, Amazon's future looks bright. The company is still growing at a healthy clip while cost-cutting and new synergistic business ventures should help boost the bottom line. The near term situation is a little bit more complicated. While analysts are optimistic (projecting a gain of 36% over the next 12 months), macroeconomic uncertainty and and a potential recession could cause downward revisions. Investors may want to wait for a better entry point before they consider opening a new position in the stock.",

            "content": "No matter how much you thought you'd love your newest Amazon purchase, there's occasionally a time when you'll need to make a return. Amazon now charges a $1 fee for returning some packages to UPS, so you may be wondering if there are other -- free -- methods to return your order. Luckily, the answer is yes.\n\nThe online retailer still offers plenty of ways to return items for free without a hassle, whether it's something small and compact or a larger item, such as a mattress. For the most part, the process is super simple, but there are some tips to keep in mind in order to make your return as seamless as possible.\n\nHow to return an Amazon package\n\nTo start a return, head to your recent orders and select the item that you want to return. Amazon will ask you why you want to return the item, then give you return options, including where to drop your package off.\n\nThen, all you need to do is grab the Amazon products you want to send back and head to the nearest drop-off location. Don't fret if you don't have the box your items came in. You can still bring your items to one of the listed locations where it will be packed up and shipped for free.\n\nIf you have all the shipping supplies you need but want the convenience of having your package picked up, you can do that, too.\n\nHere's everywhere where you can return your Amazon packages.\n\nReturn your package to Kohl's or Staples\n\nIf you live near a Kohl's or Staples store, Amazon returns are simple. When you start the return process with Amazon, select Kohl's Dropoff or Staples Dropoff as your preferred option. Amazon will send you a QR code that you'll need to bring when you head to the store (you can also show a picture of the QR code on your phone).\n\nOnce you give the Kohl's or Staples employee your return and show them the QR code, they'll pack, label and ship your items for free. Even better? Sometimes the store will give you coupons that you can use at a later date after you make your returns there.\n\nWhole Foods Market also accepts Amazon returns\n\nYou can also select Whole Foods Market as the drop-off location for your Amazon return. But you should note that if your preferred store isn't listed, your item or location may not be eligible. Also, only select stores offer no-box returns.\n\nOnce you've made your selection, Amazon will email you a QR code for a Whole Foods employee to scan. Grab that and the items you need to return, and head to either the Whole Foods customer service desk or return kiosk. An employee will take it from there and send off your package. After the return code is scanned, you will receive an email to the account linked to your Amazon that will confirm the return.\n\nHead to a Whole Foods Market to drop off your Amazon package. Jessica Dolcourt/CNET\n\nDrop your items at The UPS Store\n\nYou can also take your returns to The UPS Store. When selecting the method for returning your Amazon purchase, choose The UPS Store Dropoff. You don't need to have your items boxed or labeled. Instead, The UPS Store will pack, label and ship your return for free. UPS will email you a return shipping code ahead of time that you'll need to show to an employee. Just note that Amazon may charge a $1 fee if you choose UPS but another drop-off location was closer.\n\nHave UPS pick up your package\n\nIf your items are eligible for UPS pickup, you won't even have to leave your house to complete your return. When you start the return process on Amazon, follow the return prompts and select UPS Pick-up.\n\nIn this case, you'll need to package the items you're returning. However, UPS will provide the return label. UPS will pick up your package on the next business day, but you or another adult must be present. However, you should not that Amazon may charge you for this return option, so this is not a guaranteed free return option.\n\nAn adult needs to be present when UPS picks up your package. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nHead to a physical Amazon store\n\nIf you live near an Amazon store -- Amazon Fresh or Amazon Go -- you can drop off your return there. (Amazon has closed some of its physical stores, so finding a location may be more challenging.) On Amazon, select Amazon Store Dropoff. If the item can't be returned to an Amazon store, you'll get other return options.\n\nAmazon will send you a QR code to show to an employee at the Amazon store. You'll need to bring the items in their original manufacturer's packaging. And if you return items to Amazon Fresh Pickup or an Amazon Hub Locker location, you'll need to bring them in a box or box them up using the materials provided.\n\nWhat about DoorDash?\n\nDoorDash is testing a feature that will let you request a Dasher who can pick up your items and drop them off at a UPS, FedEx or USPS location. However, your items must already be packaged and sealed with the prepaid return label attached. The packages must be under 30 pounds each and worth less than $500. The company hasn't said when this option will be widely available; right now, it's only available in select areas.",

Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale runs from March 25 to March 31. With no other big sale events in view, this could be a good time to snag that mesh router, set of headphones, or robo vac you\u2019ve had your eye on. As usual, Amazon has discounts on all sorts of stuff, but many deals are exclusive to Amazon Prime members.\n\nNow, we\u2019re not suggesting you harvest this spring deal crop indiscriminately; we are here to help you sort the wheat from the chaff. The WIRED Gear team has run its many eyes over the list to tease out deals that are for gadgets worth owning and actually deals.

Amazon\u2019s Eero makes some of our favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check our Eero buying guide to decide which is best for your home. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nDJI\u2019s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI\u2019s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it\u2019s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nBuilt to last, this braided nylon cable\u2019s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the best USB-C cables for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is our favorite budget option in our guide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn\u2019t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren\u2019t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via the Razer Synapse app. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nThis Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there\u2019s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There\u2019s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. It\u2019s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPhotograph: Ugreen\n\nUgreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your carry-on. It\u2019s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nA classic among podcasters and gamers, the Blue Yeti is a great-sounding microphone that suits virtually every need you\u2019ll have. A steep discount makes this a must-buy for anyone who is mic shopping this spring, given that these usually retail for well over $100. I like that these have physical controls on the microphone, which makes it easy to mute and adjust volume on the fly. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nI hate using clip-on reading lights because I always feel like they\u2019re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It\u2019s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions\u2014once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You\u2019ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother 120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Amazon Device Deals\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nWhen Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids\u2019 versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you\u2019re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It\u2019s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThis is the best Kindle (8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and a Premium Pen that has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you\u2019re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes). \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon\u2019s standard Fire tablets, but you\u2019ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you\u2019re covered. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe Fire HD 10 Pro Kid\u2019s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon\u2019s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Deals\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nThis cute little smart plug works with every smart home speaker you could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won\u2019t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It\u2019s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it\u2019ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It\u2019s got a nice small form factor so you won\u2019t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It\u2019s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I\u2019ve tried, and at $18, it\u2019s one of the lowest prices we\u2019ve seen for it this year. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nTushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom\u2014renters included\u2014since it\u2019s a small accessory that doesn\u2019t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it\u2019s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom\u2019s vibe. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nPhotograph: Dyson\n\nThis excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn\u2019t go on sale super often). It\u2019s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might\u2019ve missed otherwise. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It\u2019s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn\u2019t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson\u2019s offering. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nTrue Classic\u2019s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the \u201cdad bod\u201d fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he\u2019d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it\u2019s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it\u2019s a solid tee that won\u2019t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nDyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I\u2019d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that\u2019ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It\u2019s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it\u2019s also the most sophisticated air management system I\u2019ve tested. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nWe are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). \u2014Adrienne So\n\nYeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price\u2014the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nTineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets\u2014I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this\u2014including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it\u2019s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you\u2019re in. There\u2019s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it\u2019s brand-new. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThis family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it\u2019s so easy to pick up and play, and it\u2019s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It\u2019s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don\u2019t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Home Office Deals\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it\u2019s put together, it\u2019s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nI love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I\u2019ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak\u2019s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There\u2019s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Kitchen Deals\n\nPhotograph: Andrew Watman\n\nAny ol\u2019 carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can\u2019t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to \u201chydrate\u201d or fill you with energy. Anyway, it\u2019s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nWIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator\u2019s fast mode\u2014so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine\u2019s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It\u2019s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general\u2014I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you\u2019re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Aucma\n\nLook, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that\u2019ll bother some batter, and you don\u2019t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville\u2019s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It\u2019s one I\u2019ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn\u2019t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Aeropress\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you\u2019ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it\u2019s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I\u2019ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED\u2019s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we\u2019ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we\u2019ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don\u2019t beep\u2014the simple dial keeps things quiet.\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Beauty Deals\n\nPhotograph: Chi\n\nThis is the original \u201cupgrade\u201d hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it\u2019s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn\u2019t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you\u2019ll find for $50. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThis consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it\u2019s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you\u2019d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming\u2014the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you\u2019d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Philips\n\nIf oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you\u2019re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it\u2019s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you\u2019ve been brushing and will remind you when it\u2019s time to replace the head. Normally $50\u2014now $40\u2014this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we\u2019ve tested. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nIf you\u2019re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it\u2019s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won\u2019t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it\u2019s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it\u2019s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nManscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer\u2019s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn\u2019t the lowest price we\u2019ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it\u2019s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn\u2019t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you\u2019re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you\u2019re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nIf TikTok\u2019s raving about it, I\u2019m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid\u2014but don\u2019t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it\u2019s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we\u2019ve seen the price dip lower before. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThese cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It\u2019s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it\u2019s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I\u2019m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nMicellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It\u2019s me, I\u2019m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don\u2019t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it\u2019s affordable and easy to find (and I don\u2019t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Withings\n\nThis topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you\u2019re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nAfina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Mobile Phone Deals (Plus Accessories)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we\u2019ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier\u2014including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we\u2019ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don\u2019t forget a case! \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThe best smart display to invest in isn\u2019t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren\u2019t using the tablet. It\u2019s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you\u2019re able to use it all day long. It\u2019s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nIt has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung\u2019s latest smartwatch. It\u2019s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying\u2014it\u2019ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it\u2019s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nTesting Google\u2019s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said \u201cround is better than square.\u201d It\u2019s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google\u2019s integration with it is virtually perfect. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nWant a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life\u2014extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest TV Deals (Plus Streaming Devices)\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThis tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it\u2019s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you\u2019re not watching shows and movies. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nBest Speaker Deals\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBeats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill\u2019s stylish frame isn\u2019t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThese perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that\u2019s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nUltimate Ears\u2019 Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it\u2019s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears\u2019 app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you\u2019re ready to grab your next patio companion now\u2019s a good time. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you\u2019re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis isn\u2019t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it\u2019s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Headphone Deals\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThese cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you\u2019re after a pair that look good and that you don\u2019t need to worry about, start here. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nIf you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nSoundcore\u2019s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren\u2019t just another AirPods clone. They\u2019re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you\u2019ll pay for Apple\u2019s best buds. You\u2019re not getting Apple\u2019s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore\u2019s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it\u2019s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony\n\nWe see this discount frequently, but we\u2019d be remiss not to include it here since it\u2019s the best deal we see for the best headphones we\u2019ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).\u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They\u2019re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take \u2019em to the gym. It\u2019s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don\u2019t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.\u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nA sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I\u2019ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I\u2019ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don\u2019t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they\u2019re a guilt-free budget buy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you\u2019re an Apple user who doesn\u2019t want to spend $250, then Beats\u2019 previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them \u201cApple\u2019s best earbuds ever.\u201d) They\u2019re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nIf I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company\u2019s models, whether it\u2019s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don\u2019t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nBose isn\u2019t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we\u2019ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we\u2019ve seen, so if you\u2019re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now\u2019s a good time. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They\u2019re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they\u2019ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn\u2019t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they\u2019re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it\u2019s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It\u2019s bulkier than other cases I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It\u2019s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Pet Deals\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nThe Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic. Half of us on the Gear desk swear by it. The viral TikTok gadget crushes fur and lint like nothing else. Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It\u2019s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It\u2019s infinitely reusable\u2014I\u2019ve owned one for nearly six years and it\u2019s still going strong. I like to keep it on the coffee table so I can quickly de-fluff my furniture if guests pop by\u2014because we all know I\u2019m not going to be kicking my cat off the sofa. (She especially knows this.) \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nA top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThe Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats\u2019 usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells \u2026 good? At $430, this is the lowest price we\u2019ve ever seen it. But I\u2019d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat\u2019s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nThis fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We\u2019ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it\u2019s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats\u2019 well-being. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\n\nBest Outdoor Deals\n\nPhotograph: Birdfy\n\nAs we\u2019ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)\u2014every model we\u2019ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn\u2019t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won\u2019t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nDespite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy\u2019s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder\u2019s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhotograph: Repel\n\nThe Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it\u2019s open. There\u2019s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You\u2019ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it\u2019s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there\u2019s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It\u2019s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals",

How We Tested\n\nI see you, annotators \u2014 the readers with color-coded highlighting systems and tabs sticking out of every book. Going digital with an e-reader might not seem like it's for you, but with all the advancements in the market, things are changing. I've seen it all, from the most basic Kindle to a color e-reader and now the Kindle Scribe.\n\nLaunched in late 2024, Amazon debuted the next generation of the Kindle Scribe. It's the largest in the brand's lineup and the only model that comes with a pen and the ability to write. I'd spent time with the previous generation of Scribe, so I wanted to see how Amazon improved the device. Unfortunately... it wasn't much.\n\nHere's what I think about the Kindle Scribe and if it's worth it.\n\nKindle Scribe price and specs\n\nPutting the original Kindle Scribe (left) head to head with the 2024 Kindle Scribe (right). Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nThe 2024 Kindle Scribe is the same size as the previous generation but features a redesigned screen with even borders surrounding the screen.\n\nThese are the full specs for the 2024 Kindle Scribe:\n\n10.2-inch display, up to 94 nits brightness, and 300 ppi resolution\n\nUSB-C charging port with up to 12 weeks of battery life\n\nStarts at 16GB of storage, with 32GB and 64GB options available\n\nPremium pen included\n\nComes in tungsten (dark gray) and metallic jade\n\nNot waterproof\n\nAll the perks of a Kindle e-reader, plus annotation\n\nJotting down my thoughts on the Kindle Scribe... on the Kindle Scribe. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nKindles are great e-readers \u2014 our favorite, in fact. So, it's no surprise that the Kindle Scribe has the same possibilities. You can access books through the Kindle Store or Libby. Like all Kindles, there's seamless Libby integration to make it easy to read your library books.\n\nBut it has something other Kindles don't, the ability to annotate. With an included stylus (called the \"premium pen\"), you can write using the notebook feature as a digital notebook. Plus, this latest generation of Kindle Scribe allows you to annotate within the margins of books. I used it to annotate long PDFs, write notes in the margins, and handwrite line edits. Once I was done, I could send the annotated document from the Kindle to my email so I could easily send it back to my colleague.\n\nWhen not in use, the premium pen magnetically attaches to the Kindle Scribe, keeping it within reach.\n\nIt's the slowest e-reader in the line-up\n\nWhile it offers the same ability as other Kindles to read through a vast array of books, it is noticeably slower than other models in Amazon's line-up. When Amazon announced the new generation of Kindles in late 2024, the Kindle, Paperwhite, and Paperwhite Signature Edition were all touted as the brand's fastest devices, which they certainly are.\n\nWhile the Kindle Scribe's displays have been redesigned, its processor has not been updated. The Scribe often lags when starting to wake up or switching between journals and books. I also noticed some pauses when turning pages, something I never experience on other Kindles. This is especially disappointing considering the price, which is more than double that of the Paperwhite.\n\nIt's nice to write on, but the displays will ghost you\n\nAfter switching to the notebook section of the Kindle, you can still see book covers from my library bleeding through the screen. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nWhen it comes to annotating and writing on a Kindle Scribe, I love the tactile feel. The anti-glare screen and premium pen of the Kindle Scribe have a texture that emulates the feeling of writing with pen and paper. It's much different and preferential to the slippery texture of writing on an iPad with an Apple Pencil.\n\nHowever, while the display has a nice feel, it suffers from a ghosting issue. The back end of the premium pen works as an eraser, so you can flip it over when you want to erase some notes. However, a shadow of your erased writing really lingers. When I exited the notebook I had erased, the shadow lingered even as I opened a new book and tried to read.\n\nIt's more expensive than an iPad\n\nThe Kindle Scribe is not a tablet. It's an e-reader with the ability to write. Why am I noting this? Because it's certainly priced like a tablet. The Kindle Scribe starts at $399.99 for the 16GB model and tops out at $449.99 for the 64GB model. Considering the recently launched 11th generation iPad with 128GB of storage starts at $349.99, the Kindle Scribe is a terrible value.\n\nA tablet, like an iPad, has so many capabilities, like browsing social media and the web, streaming video, gaming, drawing, and even reading, with access to the Kindle app, Apple Books, and even Libby on there. Meanwhile, you're limited to just reading or writing on a Scribe \u2014 no streaming, gaming, or more. If you're looking for a distraction-free reader, maybe that's a draw. But otherwise, it's just too expensive.\n\nIs the Kindle Scribe worth it?\n\nKindles are usually great e-readers, but the Scribe doesn't live up to the rest of the line-up. Credit: Samantha Mangino\n\nThere's only one specific circumstance I imagine the Kindle Scribe is worth. If you're an avid annotator and want a distraction-free e-reader, the Kindle Scribe is great. It allows you to write notes in the margins of e-books or annotate PDFs, which you can then view on your computer.\n\nBut otherwise, if you're excited by the idea of an e-reader you can annotate on, look elsewhere. For $399.99, the Kindle Scribe isn't worth it with its meager performance and screen ghosting issues.\n\nIf you want an e-reader that you can annotate with, check out the Kobo Libra Colour, which costs $229.99. The Libra Colour is $170 less than the base model Kindle Scribe and comes with twice the storage. Or, if you want to spend your money on something that can do more than just read and write, swing for the iPad 11th generation, which is $349.99 \u2014 still $50 cheaper than the Scribe.",

Straight Arrow News\n\nEssex Town residents are concerned about a proposed 107,000-square-foot distribution center that could be occupied by Amazon.\n\nResidents voiced concerns about potential negative environmental impacts, increased traffic, and harm to local businesses.\n\nAmazon representatives stated the facility would be a last-mile delivery station serving a 70-mile radius.\n\nThe Development Review Board did not vote on the proposal and will revisit it at a later date.\n\nEssex Town residents are voicing their concerns over a proposed 107,000-square-foot distribution center.\n\nThey're concerned the building and traffic will have negative environmental impacts and potentially draw customers away from small businesses.\n\nThose concerns have been voiced across social media, where Burlington and Essex business Phoenix Books called residents to action to attend the Development Review Board meeting on March 20, where plans for the development were to be discussed.\n\nKatie DeSanto, general manager of Phoenix Books in Essex, shared her concerns with Amazon deliveries taking away work from USPS, FedEx and UPS, stating that \"the infrastructure is already in place,\" and that there doesn't have to be \"instant gratification\" that comes with next day Amazon deliveries.\n\nThe item in question was not the only item on the board's agenda and was not introduced until almost three hours into the meeting. Developers from Scannell Properties, LLC shared the plans for the physical building and surrounding acreage before an open forum began.\n\nIt was a turnout larger than the Development Review Board was expecting, if the overflowing room, standing occupants and lack of microphones - making it a challenging listen for attendees in the back - was any indication.\n\nAround 80 residents crunched their way into the Municipal Building, a line out the door forming as attendees signed in before entering. Approximately, 60 people joined virtually.\n\nIs Amazon building on Saxon Hill Road in Essex Junction\n\nThe building site would be off Saxon Hill Road in Essex Junction. While still in the early stages, Amazon has interest in housing a facility at the lot. The international company is not mentioned by name in development documents, but Jonathan Greeley, Amazon\u2019s head of economic development for New England, joined the developers to speak on the project and answer questions.\n\nVermonters, often known for their opposition of big business and corporate mindset, shared their displeasure in having an Amazon distribution center in their neighborhood.\n\nIf built, it would be the first in the state. Greeley said Vermont's Amazon deliveries are all currently delivered by third parties. He provided more context of what an Amazon operation would look like in Vermont.\n\n\"As a last-mile delivery station, product will make its way here from warehouses primarily in Massachusetts or Connecticut,\" Greenley said. \"It would make its way to this building; we would sort it and send it out in approximately a 70-mile radius.\"\n\nWhat are residents' concerns\n\nMany impassioned residents took the floor to speak of their concerns - often followed by rousing applause by other residents - before the meeting was concluded at 11 p.m. Not all concerns were addressed before the meeting was adjourned.\n\nVarious environmental concerns were brought up including that a large distribution warehouse necessitates trucks frequenting the surrounding roadways. The site is located a few miles from Interstate 89, leading to questions about the heightened presence of trucks and vans on smaller, quieter, and often neighborhood roadways.\n\nOne resident who lives \"across the street from where this is proposed,\" said that small trucks, large trucks or employees driving in as they go to work will be \"significant and noticeable.\"\n\nShe cited noise pollution and environmental pollution affecting residents and wildlife, and a concern of safety for kids, stating a \"one-year-old just moved in across the street.\"\n\nDevelopers said there would be scheduled times for the vehicles arriving at the facility, estimated one or two trucks an hour would depart between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nBesides the physical building impact, residents were concerned about the impact a company like Amazon could have on local small businesses, along with concerns about working conditions at Amazon facilities.\n\nGreeley commented on the relationship between Vermont businesses and Amazon, stating that, \"more than 600 businesses in Vermont use Amazon to reach their consumer...in 2023, the average business generated $250,000 in revenue from Amazon and sold 6 million items total.\"\n\nBill Calfee, owner of Myti - a Vermont-based e-commerce platform that connects online shoppers to local retailers, and ships products in days - said that an Amazon facility would be a threat to small businesses and workers that support the local economy.\n\n\"Vermont prides itself on strong labor protections and thriving small businesses,\" Calfee said. \"Amazon's model undermines both.\"\n\nThe board did not vote on the proposal but will at a later date. Its meetings are held on the first Thursday of each month and the third Thursday of the month as needed.\n\nSydney P. Hakes is the Burlington city reporter. Contact her at SHakes@gannett.com.",

The Matter-supported LED lamp offers vibrant colors and a ton of lighting possibilities with 1725 lumens of brightness. You can control it via voice commands or via the Govee app, which lets you create custom lighting profiles for when you're reading, working, or just watching TV.

It works with Apple HomeKit, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

I bought mine late last year, so I've been using it for about 3 months now. I opted for the M4 Pro and it's smooth like butter. Even when I have 50+ browser tabs open while editing a photo and streaming a 4K YouTube video, the Mac mini doesn't break a sweat. In our Mac mini M4 review we said even the base model is supercharged. As far as price, it hit $499 a few times last year during Cyber Monday. But even at $529 \u2014 which is it's second lowest price ever \u2014 it's an epic steal. Btw, the M4 Pro model is just $5 shy of it's all-time price low. I recommend it a thousand times over.

We gave them a 3-star rating in our Beats Studio Pro review, as we liked their strong noise cancelation, options for Bluetooth and wired listening and battery life that lasts up to 40 hours. I wouldn't recommend picking them up at their MSRP of $349, as you can get more for your money from competition like the Sony WH-1000XM5. But now that these headphones cost just $179, they're tough to beat. Just note that their lowest price ever is $159, so you could wait and see if they drop to this price again.

            "content": "Amazon is claiming the nation\u2019s premier product safety agency is unconstitutional, deploying an argument that has found favor with the Trump administration as the company seeks to avoid responsibility for shipping dangerous products to consumers. The giant retailer filed suit last week against the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a federal agency with a 50-year history of protecting consumers from deadly cribs, refrigerators, garage doors and other potentially dangerous products.\n\nAmazon is asking a federal court in Maryland to throw out the commission\u2019s January order that the company is legally responsible for every harmful product sold on its site, such as defective hair dryers and carbon monoxide detectors.\n\nSince 2021, the retailer has argued that it should not be considered a \u201cdistributor\u201d of goods found in its online store from other companies that pay to list their items with Amazon. The company argues that it merely ships these goods for others \u2014 similar to UPS and FedEx \u2014 and should not be required to cooperate with the CPSC on recalls if those products are found to be unsafe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit goes further, saying the company shouldn\u2019t have to comply with the January ruling of the commissioners, claiming they are illegally protected from being fired by the president. The company argues the commission\u2019s structure violates the Constitution by blending judicial and executive powers.\n\n\u201cAmazon is suffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm from being subjected to an order issued by an unconstitutionally structured agency,\u201d the suit says.\n\nAmazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have filed lawsuits arguing that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the agency charged with protecting workers\u2019 right to unionize, is unconstitutional. Walmart and Kroger have brought such claims against the Federal Trade Commission, where President Donald Trump fired two Democratic commissioners this week.\n\nLast month, Trump fired NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox and two members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Wilcox filed a lawsuit challenging her removal that is being heard in a federal appeals court. Ultimately, the question of whether regulators can be protected from removal by the president could be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration has indicated that it will not defend the 90-year-old legal precedent that protects some federal regulators from executive removal, known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor, should it be challenged in court.\n\nOver the past 10 years, conservative lawyers have increasingly raised these constitutional arguments, said Georgetown constitutional lawyer Victoria Nourse. So far, they have been hamstrung by legal precedent.\n\nBut \u201cnow that Trump has said, \u2018I\u2019m going to attack Humphrey\u2019s Executor,\u2019 it gives them new life to try and attack the agencies,\u201d she said. Nourse described lawsuits like Amazon\u2019s as \u201clittle fires being lit all over Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Trump wants and what the companies want is to get rid of all this regulation, period.\u201d\n\nTrump could more easily deliver on his promises to slash regulation if he gains the ability to fire whomever he wants and appoints business-friendly replacements, said Georgetown Law professor David Vladeck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can smother an agency like the CPSC simply by putting in people who don\u2019t care about the agency\u2019s mission and wouldn\u2019t go after companies like Amazon just because they\u2019re selling products that might hurt people,\u201d said Vladeck, a former director of the Bureau for Consumer Protection at the FTC.\n\nAmazon has moved to exploit the Trump administration\u2019s disruption of independent regulators. The company used Wilcox\u2019s firing to argue that it shouldn\u2019t have to recognize a successful union election at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia and to try to delay a hearing in an unfair-labor-practice case brought by Amazon drivers in Palmdale, California.\n\n\u201cWe have proactive measures in place to prevent unsafe products, and we continuously monitor the listings in our store,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Juliana Karber said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf we discover an unsafe product available for sale, we address the issue immediately, and refine our processes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company declined to comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nThe CPSC declined to comment on this story. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nBefore Amazon challenged the constitutionality of the CPSC, a baby product company, a magnet company and a conservative blog all made the same argument in different suits, most of which failed.\n\nThe baby products company, Leachco, is represented by Pacific Legal. Oliver Dunford, who oversees the firm\u2019s separation of powers division, said it is exciting that Amazon has thrown its weight behind arguments he has been making for years.\n\nThe goal of this work, Dunford told The Post, is \u201cto limit each branch of government to its proper powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s suit against the CPSC \u2014 particularly its argument that the CPSC unconstitutionally exercises the government\u2019s legislative, executive, and judicial powers \u2014 will hopefully highlight what small businesses with limited resources face every day,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam Wallace, director of safety advocacy at Consumer Reports, a nonprofit organization that supports the CPSC\u2019s mission, also finds Amazon\u2019s entry into the fray notable.",

Find out more about how we test.\n\nAmazon recently showed much love to its Eero family of wireless routers. Following the Eero 7 Max launch in late 2023, we recently saw the launch of the Eero 7 Outdoor satellite. We recently reviewed the entry-level Eero 7 announced in early February , and now Amazon is completing its Wi-Fi 7 product portfolio with the Eero 7 Pro.\n\nThe Eero 7 Pro fits neatly between the Eero 7 and the Eero 7 Max in Amazon\u2019s Wi-Fi 7 lineup. The Eero 7 Pro is a tri-band solution with a 6 GHz wireless band, allowing it to take full advantage of the speed benefits afforded by the Wi-Fi 7 standard (unlike the cheaper Eero 7). With a price tag of $299 for a single wireless node, the Eero 7 Pro strikes a nice middle ground in price and performance, but it will take more than that to rank it among the best Wi-Fi routers .\n\nDesign of the Amazon Eero Pro 7\n\nIt's easy to see that the Eero Pro 7 takes more of its styling cues from the Eero 7 Max than the cheaper Eero 7. The Eero Pro 7 looks almost identical to its pricier sibling, albeit at about 75 percent scale. The detailing is the same, right down to the placement of the Eero branding, status LED on the front, and the cutout on the top of the unit for ventilation.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe Eero 7 Pro also has the same high-quality plastic construction inherent to all Eeros, with a glossy white finish for the front face of each node, and a matte white finish for the back panel. Speaking of the back, the shrunken size compared to the Eero 7 Max means there is only room for three Ethernet ports on the back instead of four. In this case, both are 5 Gbps ports, and either can be used for your WAN connection. For comparison, the Eero 7 has two 2.5 Gbps ports, while the Eero 7 Max has two 2.5 Gbps ports and two 10 Gbps ports. You\u2019ll also find a USB-C port (only for power input) and a reset button.\n\nI received an Eero 7 Pro two-pack review unit. Included in the box were two Eero 7 Pro units, two 27-watt USB-C power adapters, and one CAT6a network cable.\n\nAmazon Eero 7 Pro Specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Wi-Fi Standard Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) Wi-Fi Bands 2.4 GHz: 2x2 5 GHz: 2x2 6 GHz: 2x2 CPU 1.5 GHz quad-core processor Memory 1GB RAM, 4GB Flash Coverage 2,000 square feet per node (4,000 square feet, as-tested, with two nodes) Ports 2 x 5 GbE, 1 x USB-C (for power only)\n\nSetting up the Amazon Eero 7 Pro\n\nI commend Amazon and other router manufacturers for making the setup process for modern routers easy and intuitive. Gone are the days of typing an IP address into a web browser, running through rudimentary setup procedures and hoping for the best. While some enthusiasts might shun the idea of using a smartphone app to set up a new wireless network, Amazon\u2019s approach is accessible and easy to understand for the general public.\n\nAfter downloading the Amazon Eero app (available for iOS or Android), you must log in to your Amazon account. If you\u2019re a U.S. resident, the chances are that you already have an Amazon account, allowing you to breeze past this step quickly. If you don\u2019t have an Amazon account, you can create one, or log in to the Eero app with your email address or phone number.\n\nOnce the account details are out of the way, the setup program will attempt to find the primary Eero 7 Pro node. In my case, I took one of the nodes out of the box, plugged a cable from my server into one 2.5 Gbps port and a cable from my internet gateway to the second 2.5 Gbps port. The setup program asked that I remain near the wired node while it completed the initial configuration.\n\nShortly after, I inputted an SSID and password, and setup was complete. I was asked to perform a firmware update, which I declined. The next step in the process was to add the second wireless node.\n\nThe setup program gave guidance on the best placement for the second node, which I followed. After plugging it in, the setup program found and configured it within about a minute. At this time, I performed the firmware update on both wireless nodes.\n\nAmazon Eero 7 Pro Software\n\nAs with all Eero devices, setting up and configuring the Eero 7 Pro is accomplished using the Eero app. I tried both the iOS and Android versions of the app and had no trouble using either. Amazon also updates the app several times monthly, bringing new features and stability/bug fixes.\n\nThe home screen presents internet status and all available Eero 7 Pro nodes. Clicking the internet button verifies the status of your wired connection and allows you to enable Internet Backup. Internet Backup allows you to tether your smartphone\u2019s internet connection if your primary ISP goes offline. However, this feature is exclusive to a paid Eero Plus subscription. You can also run a speed test to see how fast your internet connection is.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nClicking the buttons for each Eero 7 Pro node will allow you to turn off the LED status light on the front of the units, identify which ports are active, and inform you which wireless clients are connected. You can also see the current firmware version for the node from this screen. If you have an Eero Plus subscription, you can also access Wi-Fi radio analytics data.\n\nThe Devices tab displays and allows you to filter currently connected (and previously connected) devices on the network. Per-device access control is also available here. The Activity tab provides download/uploaded data totals for the entire network along with your most recent speed test information (speed tests are conducted automatically in the background by the Eero 7 Pro, or you can manually initiate them).\n\nThe Settings tab gives you additional network options to configure, including enabling a guest network or MLO mode. You can also perform a software update from this menu (which can be scheduled to start during off-peak hours).\n\nThe Eero software doesn\u2019t offer much granular control over available settings like many leading router manufacturers, especially at this price point. You\u2019ll find greater flexibility and desktop UI access with competing Netgear, Asus, and TP-Link products.\n\nIf you\u2019re not too keen on being relegated to an app for network configuration and maintenance, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere. One other note: Eeros don\u2019t support Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) via a hardware button or in software. So, suppose you have a device that exclusively uses that method to connect to a network. In that case, you\u2019re out of luck unless you want to use a workaround (which requires briefly connecting the WPS-only client to another wireless router).\n\nHowever, the biggest downside to this router is that Amazon locks many useful router features behind a paywall. Eero Plus is a subscription service that costs $9.99/month or $99.99/year. It adds the previously-mentioned Internet Backup, DDNS, ad blocking, 1Password integration, Guardian VPN, content filters, and more. With many routers offering similar features at no additional cost, paying a month or yearly fee for those luxuries is a touch pill to swallow.\n\nPerformance of the Amazon Eero 7 Pro\n\nWe currently use a Windows 11 desktop with an MSI Pro B650M-A Wi-Fi motherboard, AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, 32GB of DDR5, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, and an MSI Herald-BE Wi-Fi 7 PCIe adapter for our Wi-Fi 7 client testing. All the hardware uses the most recent software, BIOS, firmware, and drivers (where applicable).\n\nThe iPerf3 throughput tests are conducted with a Windows 11 server equipped with an onboard 10 Gbps wired network card connected to the 5 Gbps LAN port on the primary Eero 7 Pro node. Wireless tests are conducted at 6-foot and 25-foot distances.\n\nImage 1 of 12 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nWireless tests are first run with the network free of added traffic from other connected clients. Then, those same tests are completed with simulated traffic from additional users accessing the network (for our testing, we use six clients streaming 4K video from YouTube).\n\nThings started strong in our 6 GHz iPerf3 test, the Eero 7 Pro hitting 1,607 Mbps at close range (6 feet). This was slightly behind the Netgear Orbi 770 and a couple hundred Mbps slower than the TP-Link Deco BE65 Pro . However, things turned sharply downward at longer distances (25 feet). Performance dropped by over 60 percent, achieving just 585 Mbps compared to 845 Mbps for the Deco BE65 Pro and 1,106 Mbps for the Orbi 770.\n\nWith additional traffic on the network, 6-foot performance dipped to 1,217 Mbps while performance at 25-feet remained relatively stable at 544 Mbps.\n\nShifting over to 5 GHz performance, the Eero 7 Pro again found itself at the back of the pack, but the difference between third and second place wasn\u2019t as dramatic this time. We saw 992 Mbps at 6 feet and 463 Mbps at 25 feet with no additional traffic on the network. With congested traffic, the Eero 7 Pro saw a significant drop-off in performance at close range, falling to 595 Mbps. At 25-feet, performance stayed in the same ballpark (403 Mbps congested, versus 463 Mbps uncongested).\n\n2.4 GHz with and without traffic was unremarkable in this group of competitors. The Eero 7 Pro lagged far behind the Orbi 770 and the Deco BE65 Pro in all metrics. It could only muster 83 Mbps at 6 feet (uncongested) and 73 Mbps (congested). Performance at 25 was equally disappointing, with 55 Mbps (uncongested) at 46 (congested). Interestingly, 2.4 GHz performance fell below that of the cheaper Eero 7.\n\nBottom Line",

That\u2019s 28% off its list price of $249.99.\n\nI think every room deserves a TV. Especially if that TV is just $179.97 and happens to be smart, compact, and secretly a Fire TV. Amazon Fire TV 2-Series (40-inch model) is down 28% right now, bringing it well under the $200 mark. That makes it perfect for bedrooms, guest rooms, college dorms, or your kitchen if you\u2019re feeling fancy.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not 4K. But unless you\u2019re sitting six inches from the screen, HD is more than fine on a 40-incher.

With over 1 million movies and TV episodes across Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, and all the usual suspects, you\u2019ve got endless content to ignore while scrolling TikTok.\n\nI love that you can bounce from one Fire TV to another and everything syncs up \u2013 start watching something in the living room, finish watching it in bed.

You\u2019re looking at a regularly $2,899 configuration seeing a deep $308 price drop to deliver the lowest price we can find.\n\nWhile we did see a very brief offer on this model at $2,589 on Amazon that lasted for about half a day, the discount on tap this morning comes within a few bucks of the best price we have tracked on this one, Black Friday and holiday 2024 included.\n\nIf the 48GB setup on this config is a bit overkill for you, Amazon is also offering a notable price on the 24GB model with the 512GB SSD down at $2,229 shipped. Regularly $2,499, you\u2019re looking at a $270 price drop here on both the Space Black and silver colorways to deliver the best price of the year \u2013 this one did drop to the $2,199 all-time low for Black Friday last year, but today\u2019s deal is the best we have tracked otherwise, coming within $30 of the best price yet.\n\nThe latest 16-incher MacBook Pro units are indeed a more niche purchase \u2013 it would seem most folks would rather side-step the premium on the extra screen real estate in favor of a more compact and affordable 14-inch variant, and understandably so. But if you are looking for a powerful new M4 Pro machine without paying the M4 Max cash, and enjoy the larger screen display, today\u2019s deals should be on your radar.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the deals live this week on other M4 MacBook Pro configurations for reference:\n\nApple M4 Pro MacBook Pro features:\n\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro or M4 Max chip gives you outrageous performance in a powerhouse laptop built for Apple Intelligence.* With all-day battery life and a breathtaking Liquid Retina XDR display with up to 1600 nits peak brightness, it\u2019s pro in every way.

But Garmin\u2019s smartwatches are specifically made for any and every physical activity or outdoor adventure. There\u2019s a big difference, and it\u2019s one you usually have to pay a premium price for. But Amazon\u2019s just dropped a gigantic 54% sale on one of the very best fitness sportswatches around, the Garmin Epix Gen 2. This premium smartwatch is just $409 during this deal, a dramatic break from its usual $899.\n\nSee at Amazon\n\nCompare and contrast: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799, and even if you max out the big trade-in credit offers from Samsung, their Galaxy Watch Ultra would still be a little under $100 less than the Garmin Epix Gen 2. Those are stellar smartwatches that also offer many cool and useful fitness features, but the Garmin Epix Gen 2 is heads and shoulders ahead of them and the rest of the competition when it comes to hardcore workout and adventure capability.\n\nReady for Action\n\nBefore we delve into the great many features of the Garmin Epix, we should establish it as a legit tough and battle-ready smartwatch that\u2019s able to withstand the elements and the occasional drop or collision. Start with the titanium bezel that looks premium and provides protection while not weighing down your arm. The body of the smartwatch is made from a fiber-reinforced polymer that acts as a lightweight yet nearly impenetrable suit of armor. The 1.3-inch always-on AMOLED screen is scratch-resistant, and the whole thing comes together to provide a unit that\u2019s waterproof down to 10 atmospheres, in case your preferred form of adventuring happens on or in the high seas.\n\nSee at Amazon\n\nWhen you take the Garmin Epix out into the wilderness, even if you\u2019re headed off the grid, this smartwatch is absolutely packed with preloaded maps and exceptional satellite reception thanks to its multi-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) support for not only GPS, but also Galileo and GLONASS to keep you safe. Elevation data, a barometric monitor, and 3-axis electronic compass complete the Garmin Epix\u2019s outdoor package.\n\nTake All the Gym Classes\n\nThere are 30 sports apps built into the Garmin Epix that track and gauge your performance, whether your fitness jam is trail running, yoga, HIIT training, or dozens of others. The Garmin Epix even delivers easy-to-follow animated workout moves for cardio, yoga, strength, and Pilates workouts, all easily seen on that big AMOLED screen that\u2019s always on so you don\u2019t have to stop to tap and refresh your view. The free Garmin Coach training plans are abundantly customizable to fit your goals.\n\nEvery health metric you need \u2014 heart rate, respiration, blood-oxygen saturation, stress levels, sleep quality and more \u2014 is captured and displayed for you by the Garmin Epix, along with Garmin\u2019s exclusive Body Battery Energy Monitoring feature which takes all of those factors into account and lets you know when it\u2019s time for a sensible rest day.\n\nThe Amazon-reduced $409 price tag on the Garmin Epix Gen 2 vastly undercuts the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and places it into a pricing competition with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, assuming you\u2019re cashing in on one of Samsung\u2019s frequent deals. But in terms of being suited for the most active adventurers and serious workout freaks, there\u2019s no competition at all \u2014 the Garmin Epix Gen 2 is the smartwatch you need.\n\nSee at Amazon",

I had hard, scaly water deposits on the glass surrounding our powder room faucet (one of those fancy, highfalutin modern-looking things). I've tried everything for 4 years to get this stuff off. One day I thought, maybe i'll try my sponges. Took it all off super easily!!!! Faucet looks like new. My only rec is to spot-test your item first before using it because it will scratch certain surfaces if you scrub too aggressively (for example, it gets the burned-on, weird stuff off of the bottom of my fave Our Place pan, but I rubbed too hard in one spot and it took the color right off lol).\" \u2014Hoarder\n\nPrice: $7.99+ for eight (available in two sponge thicknesses).",

            "content": "On March 14, 2025, Amazon filed suit against the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging CPSC\u2019s July 29, 2024, and January 16, 2025, orders determining that Amazon is \u201ca \u2018distributor\u2019 of certain products that are defective or fail to meet federal consumer product safety standards, and therefore bears legal responsibility for their recall.\u201d According to CPSC\u2019s January 17, 2025, announcement, \u201c[m]ore than 400,000 products are subject to this Order: specifically, faulty carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection, and children\u2019s sleepwear that violated federal flammability standards.\u201d CPSC determined that the products, listed on Amazon.com and sold by third-party sellers using the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program, pose a \u201csubstantial product hazard\u201d under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). In its complaint, Amazon argues that CPSC \u201coverstepped\u201d the statutory limits of the CPSA by ordering \u201ca wide-ranging recall of products that were manufactured, owned, and sold by third parties,\u201d not Amazon itself. Amazon states that CPSC\u2019s recall order \u201crelies on an unprecedented legal theory that stretches the [CPSA] beyond the breaking point and fails to discharge\u201d CPSC\u2019s obligations under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\nAmazon argues that it \u201cfalls within the definition of third-party logistics provider with respect to products sold using the FBA service because it does not manufacture, own, or sell those products, but instead stores and ships them on behalf of third-party sellers who retain title throughout the transaction.\u201d Amazon notes that CPSC\u2019s July 2021 administrative complaint was the \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d in seeking to label an online marketplace as a distributor under the CPSA, holding it responsible for recalling products \u201cbecause it provided the third-party sellers with logistics services.\u201d Amazon cites a statement by Robert S. Adler, then Acting Chair of CPSC, \u201cadmitt[ing] that the \u2018statute is not perfectly clear on\u2019 whether the Commission\u2019s authority extends to Amazon\u2019s FBA service.\u201d\n\nAmazon also argues that CPSC violated the APA in requiring a new round of recall notices, despite Amazon \u201chaving already twice notified every individual who purchased the products\u201d and that Amazon \u201cissue new refunds to purchasers (despite having already provided a full refund to every customer in 2021 or 2022).\u201d According to Amazon, CPSC\u2019s typical product recall practices require only a single round of notices, and binding precedent holds that CPSC \u201cacknowledge and provide a \u2018reasoned explanation for\u2019\u201d departing from its past practice.\n\nAccording to Amazon, the CPSA vests CPSC Commissioners \u201cwith a potent combination of governmental functions, authorizing them to act as judge, jury, and prosecutor in the same proceeding.\u201d Amazon notes that the body that voted to file the complaint against it \u2014 the Commissioners \u2014 \u201calso has the power to hear the evidence, decide factual disputes, interpret and apply the law to the facts, and fashion the remedy.\u201d Amazon states that this arrangement \u201ccontravenes Amazon\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights because it \u2018violates the [Supreme] Court\u2019s longstanding teaching that ordinarily \u2018no man can be a judge in his own case\u2019 consistent with the Due Process Clause.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmazon asks the court to:\n\nVacate CPSC\u2019s January 16, 2025, Final Order, as well as all earlier orders, \u201cas arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, and contrary to constitutional right\u201d;\n\nDeclare that Amazon is a third-party logistics provider, not a distributor, with regards to its FBA logistics service; and\n\nDeclare the Commissioners\u2019 statutory removal protections unconstitutional.\n\nMore information on CPSC\u2019s July 29, 2024, Decision and Order is available in our August 5, 2024, blog item.",

The general availability of Amazon Q Business in the Europe (Ireland) Region will support customers across Ireland and the EU to transform how their employees work and access information, while maintaining data security and privacy requirements.\n\nAWS customers and partners innovate using Amazon Q Business in Europe\n\nOrganizations across the EU are using Amazon Q Business for a wide variety of use cases, including answering questions about company data, summarizing documents, and providing business insights.\n\nKatya Dunets, the AWS Lead Sales Engineer for Adastra noted,\n\nAdastra stands at the forefront of technological innovation, specializing in artificial intelligence, data, cloud, digital, and governance services. Our team was facing the daunting challenge of sifting through hundreds of documents on SharePoint, searching for content and information critical for market research and RFP generation. This process was not only time-consuming but also impeded our agility and responsiveness. Recognizing the need for a transformative solution, we turned to Amazon Q Business for its prowess in answering queries, summarizing documents, generating content, and executing tasks, coupled with its direct SharePoint integration. Amazon Q Business became the catalyst for unprecedented efficiency within Adastra, dramatically streamlining document retrieval, enhancing cross-team collaboration through shared insights from past projects, and accelerating our RFP development process by 70%. Amazon Q Business has not only facilitated a smoother exchange of knowledge within our teams but has also empowered us to maintain our competitive edge by focusing on innovation rather than manual tasks. Adastra\u2019s journey with Amazon Q exemplifies our commitment to harnessing cutting-edge technology to better serve both our clients and their customers.\n\nAllCloud is a cloud solutions provider specializing in cloud stack, infrastructure, platform, and Software-as-a-Service. Their CTO, Peter Nebel stated,\n\n\u201cAllCloud faces the common challenge of information sprawl. Critical knowledge for sales and delivery teams is scattered across various tools\u2014Salesforce for customer and marketing data, Google Drive for documents, Bamboo for HR and internal information, and Confluence for internal wikis. This fragmented approach wastes valuable time as employees hunt and peck for the information they need, hindering productivity and potentially impacting client satisfaction. Amazon Q Business provides AllCloud a solution to increase productivity by streamlining information access. By leveraging Amazon Q\u2019s natural language search capabilities, AllCloud can empower its personnel with a central hub to find answers to their questions across all their existing information sources. This drives efficiency and accuracy by eliminating the need for time-consuming searches across multiple platforms and ensures all teams have access to the most up-to-date information. Amazon Q will significantly accelerate productivity, across all lines of business, allowing AllCloud\u2019s teams to focus on delivering exceptional service to their clients.\u201d\n\nLars Ritter, Senior Manager at Woodmark Consulting noted,\n\n\u201cAmazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Business have been game-changers for Woodmark. Employees struggled with time-consuming searches across various siloed systems, leading to reduced productivity and slower operations. To solve for the inefficient retrieval of corporate knowledge from unstructured data sources we turned to Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Business for help. With this innovative solution, Woodmark has been able to revolutionize data accessibility, empowering our teams to effortlessly retrieve insights using simple natural language queries, and to make informed decisions without relying on specialized data teams, which was not feasible before. These solutions have dramatically increased efficiency, fostered a data-driven culture, and positioned us for scalable growth, driving our organization toward unparalleled success.\u201d\n\nScott Kumono, Product Manager for Kinectus at Siemens Healthineers adds,\n\n\u201cAmazon Q Business has enhanced the delivery of service and clinical support for our ultrasound customers. Previously, finding specific information meant sifting through a 1,000-page manual or waiting for customer support to respond. Now, customers have instant access to answers and specifications right at their fingertips, using Kinectus Remote Service. With Amazon Q Business we were able to significantly reduce manual work and wait times to find the right information, allowing our customers to focus on what really matters \u2013 patient care.\u201d\n\nTill Gloger, Head of Digital Production Platform Region Americas at Volkswagen Group of America states,\n\n\u201cVolkswagen innovates not only on its products, but also on how to boost employee productivity and increase production throughput. Volkswagen is testing the use of Amazon Q to streamline employee workflows by potentially integrating it with existing processes. This integration has the possibility to help employees save time during the assembly process, reducing some processes from minutes to seconds, ultimately leading to more throughput.\u201d\n\nPricing\n\nWith Amazon Q Business, enterprise customers pay for user subscriptions and index capacity.

            "content": "Amazon is suing the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site\n\nNEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.\n\nThe independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.\n\nThe order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service\n\nBut Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.\n\nThe commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.\n\nAmazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.\n\n\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.\n\nAmazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

            "content": "The technology still comes with too many drawbacks to please most people.\n\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n\nAmazon's first color e-reader is decent, but doesn't make a clear case for itself against other color e-readers\u2014let alone the black-and-white Kindle you probably already own.\n\nReleased late last year, the Colorsoft garnered controversy at launch thanks to a nasty yellow bar that kept showing up on the bottom of certain devices, although affected customers have since said Amazon has offered them refunds, and complaints appear to have died down in the most recent Amazon customer reviews. My review unit displayed no such issues, but even minus obvious bugs, I'm not convinced the Colorsoft is worth the premium price\u2014$80 more than the Paperwhite Signature Edition, and $120 more than the basic Paperwhite\u2014especially considering the tradeoffs involved.\n\nThe Kindle Colorsoft isn\u2019t the first color e-reader, but it is Amazon\u2019s first stab at the technology, and according to the company, it's the best color e-reader on the market. (They would say that.)\n\nWhat is the Kindle Colorsoft?\n\nAmazon\u2019s first color e-reader looks and feels a lot like a typical Kindle, and if not for its colorful lock screen and a slightly larger display (7 inches vs. 6.8 inches), I\u2019d be hard pressed to tell it apart from my 2022 Kindle Paperwhite at a glance. Despite being the second-most-expensive of Amazon\u2019s current Kindle lineup, the Colorsoft lacks premium features like physical page turn buttons and a stylus. (It's also only available in black, if you care about such things.)\n\nI\u2019ll get into specifics in a bit, but suffice it to say that this is about as basic as a tablet can get, design-wise. You have to actually use it to appreciate the unique experience you've paid so much for, one that Amazon thinks justifies a high price tag, even in comparison to other color e-readers.\n\nWhat makes it so soft?\n\nColorsoft is a bit of a strange name for the first color Kindle. There's really only one company producing color e-ink, which means the Colorsoft uses essentially the same base display as almost every other color e-reader on the market\u2014the 7-inch E Ink Kaleido 3\u2014so it could have just been called the \u201cKindle Color.\" Nothing about it exactly reads as \u201csoft\u201d to me.\n\nBut the unusual name hints at what ostensibly sets this e-reader apart: In addition to the Kaleido 3 screen, Amazon has uniquely decked out the Colorsoft with an \u201coxide backplane\u201d that\u2019s supposed to support faster refreshes and higher contrast than its competitors, as well as \u201ca new light-guide with nitride LEDs\u201d that\u2019s supposed to enhance the color. Essentially, then, the \u201csoft\u201d in the name is intended to suggest that Amazon has done some tinkering to try to make your color images look a bit more natural than you'd see from a color Kobo or Boox tablet\u2014despite all of them using the same underlying technology.\n\nA 'Sonic the Hedgehog' comic on the Kobo Libra Colour (left) and Kindle Colorsoft (right) Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nDoes the device actually look better that any other color e-reader though? Kinda, yeah: Reading the same Sonic the Hedgehog comic from 2022 on both the Kindle Colorsoft and the Kobo Libra Colour (another e-reader using the Kaleido 3 screen), the Colorsoft\u2019s image is noticeably more consistent. Shading in particular is less prone to \u201cblotching,\u201d and looks more like solid blocks of shadow (pay close attention to Sonic\u2019s purple buddy, Espio). Colors are also a bit deeper and less washed out, relatively speaking.\n\nOlder comics, like X-Men\u2019s Dark Phoenix Saga from 1980, fare a little better across both models due to the limited printing standards of the time, which make the content a bit more manageable\u2014but even still, you'll notice slightly more detail on our titular hero-turned-villainess\u2019 face on the Colorsoft due to its increased contrast. Even black-and-white content appears smoother on the Kindle than on the Libra, as the rainbow effect, which I\u2019ll get to a little later, is far less noticeable when reading manga like Berserk or Sailor Moon.\n\nAn 'X-Men' comic on the Kobo Libra Colour (left) and Kindle Colorsoft (right) Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nI haven\u2019t personally handled color e-reader under the sun, but as most of them opt for an unaltered Kaleido 3, all of this means that the Colorsoft likely offers a better color e-reading experience than many or most of its competitors. Page turns also live up to Amazon\u2019s hype, and are noticeably snappier than on the Kobo (at least when you have page refresh off).\n\nThe issue is how much you\u2019ll actually notice this Amazon difference when you aren't looking at it side-by-side with another device, and if color is even worth it over the other compromises color e-ink asks of you. Faster page turns, for example, are pretty meaningless to me, as I usually refresh the screen with every new page, which takes about the same time on any device. They\u2019re not something I would have noticed unless I was looking hard for them, which I could say about a lot of the Colorsoft\u2019s improvements. That they\u2019re there at all at least means Amazon wasn\u2019t blowing smoke when it said the Colorsoft is different from other color e-readers, but the tech still doesn't exactly feel fully baked.\n\nDo you really want a color e-reader?\n\nThe problem is that even if the Colorsoft is the best color e-reader, color e-readers are still kind of a solution looking for a problem, and the Colorsoft does nothing to change that. Essentially, all of these devices work by filtering a black-and-white image through an additional color layer and carefully controlling which pigment shines through where, a process that creates the appearance of different colors. The E Ink Kaliedo 3 screen that most current models (including the Colorsoft) come with can produce up to 4,096 of them, which might be enough for you if you\u2019re willing to trade the billions of colors available on a more traditional tablet for the unique, easy-on-the-eyes feel of e-ink.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t read a lot of color content, it\u2019s nice to have the option if you can afford it, right? But it comes with a few drawbacks that can affect your overall reading experience, and you need to be sure you\u2019re willing to live with them before you commit, even if your wallet is bottomless. Especially because the Colorsoft also has some problems unique to it, at least once you start looking past the image quality.\n\nA 'Sonic the Hedgehog' comic on an iPad vs Kindle Colorsoft Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nFirst, using a color e-reader makes black and white content worse than on a standard e-reader. That\u2019s thanks to the rainbow effect I mentioned earlier\u2014a noticeable shimmer left behind by the inactive color layer\u2014and even when it\u2019s not being used, it can leave visible artifacts on your screen. These can range from a light glittery effect on your novels, to full-on rainbows on black-and-white imagery, as on this page from Berserk.\n\nA 'Berserk' chapter on the Kobo Libra Colour (left) and Kindle Colorsoft (right) Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nThis problem is entirely absent on black and white-only devices, and means that if you don\u2019t intend to read color content, or only want to read it sparingly, shelling out extra for a model capable of color might actually end up hurting your experience the majority of the time. From what I saw while comparing it to the Kobo Libra Colour, Amazon\u2019s model does go a bit toward correcting this, but it\u2019s still not all the way there. Compare the same page of Dune on my 2022 Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Colorsoft, and you\u2019ll quickly see what I mean.\n\n'Dune' on the Kindle Colorsoft (left) vs. 2022 Kindle Paperwhite (right) Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nSecond, using color actually hurts the clarity of your image. That\u2019s because much like a 3D TV, turning on the color feature will cut your resolution, or PPI (pixels-per-inch), in half. It\u2019s a necessary drawback to using the color filter, as not halving the resolution would result in your eyes being assaulted by every possible color, but it does mean that when you choose to read color content via e-ink rather than using a more traditional tablet, detail in the art will be reduced. Luckily, this doesn\u2019t affect black-and-white content, but it\u2019s another issue the Colorsoft can\u2019t escape.\n\nBecause of the drawbacks they present for novels and black-and-white comics like manga, the best use case for a color e-reader is either western comic books, or books with a heavy focus on color diagrams, like textbooks. However, both of these suffer from the e-reader format, especially when it comes to discoverability.\n\nWhat it's like reading comics on the Colorsoft\n\nLet\u2019s start with the issues you might encounter when you\u2019ve actually opened a digital comic. While the Colorsoft's implementation of the Kaleido 3 screen tops out at 7 inches diagonally, most American comic books are about 11.75-inches by the same metric, with textbooks not far behind. That means your art is going to be shrunk down (in addition to being lower-resolution and with less vivid colors). That\u2019s not necessarily a dealbreaker when you\u2019re already compromising resolution and vibrancy, but it might make the text in some comics too small to read.\n\n'Batman: The Long Halloween' physical graphic novel page vs. Colorsoft Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nZooming in is not an ideal solution either\u2014it's not as responsive as an LCD tablet, and takes a few seconds every time\u2014and while the Colorsoft has a \u201ccrop margins\u201d option, in testing, using it cut actual content out of the image more than once. I also couldn\u2019t get the \u201cvirtual panel\u201d option to trigger on any of my comics, although I\u2019m not a huge fan of messing with the artist\u2019s planned layout anyway. If you can get a sample of the comic you want to read before buying, be sure to check how readable it is first.\n\nThe cropped margins feature cutting off content on the Kindle Colorsoft Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nBut it\u2019s actually finding comics to buy that\u2019s the bigger issue for me. Like it or not, there are two major color comics publishers in the U.S.\u2014D.C. and Marvel\u2014and each has apps for iOS and Android. Outside of loading your own comics files onto your e-reader (I won\u2019t ask how you got them), these apps are easily the best way to find old comics, having most available back issues from their respective publishers dating back to the \u201830s. Unfortunately, neither is available on a Kindle, meaning you\u2019ll either have to buy your digital comics piecemeal, or hope they\u2019re on some other subscription you might own, like Prime or Kindle Unlimited.\n\nIf I wanted to read Amazing Spider-Man from the start, for instance, I could get the first volume of Peter Parker's collected adventures through Prime and the second through Kindle Unlimited, but after that I\u2019d be on my own. Buying the rest would be pretty costly (each volume costs $6 and includes about 10 issues), but on Marvel Unlimited, I\u2019d get access to all of them\u2014as well as pretty much every other Marvel comic not published prior to the previous three months\u2014including stories that might not be available on the Kindle store.\n\nIf Kindles could run Android apps, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but as it is, it\u2019s just much pricier if you want to read your comics legitimately here than it is on a tablet or desktop. (There are color e-ink Android tablets out there\u2014Lifehacker has tested one of them, the Boox Note Air 4C\u2014that can run any app from the Google Play store.)\n\nWhile my complaints about image quality might come across as nitpicking\u2014color e-reader aficionados know they\u2019re making compromises\u2014this is the nail in the coffin for me. What could be a fun alternate way to read is instead so siloed off that using it every once in a while would mean paying for the same content twice, since I\u2019m already subscribing to the app. Meanwhile, using it as my sole way to read comics would give me a smaller, pricier library. At this point, I\u2019d only read comics I can\u2019t get on the apps here, and while I love a good indie title, that\u2019s just not enough for me to justify buying specialized hardware. It\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not unique to the Colorsoft, but that probably goes a way towards explaining why its Amazon rating is so much lower than the Paperwhite's. It\u2019s just too niche.\n\nColor highlighting on Kindle Colorsoft Credit: Michelle Ehrhardt\n\nWhich leaves me feeling stuck. Black and white books are worse on this device. Color content is better than on similar devices on the market, but still involves compromises and, more importantly, more hunting for things to read, and more of an investment. So, what am I paying extra for? Color-collated highlighting? My book covers looking a little prettier on my library page? There\u2019s novelty here, for sure, but even if the Colorsoft does deliver the best color e-reading experience currently possible, I\u2019m not sure that's a problem that needed to be solved. Certainly for now, most color content is still better left for a traditional tablet.\n\nBut is the Kindle Colorsoft a good color e-reader?\n\nTo be fair to the Colorsoft, most of the complaints I have about it are, again, shared across all color e-readers that can't run Android apps. Say you understand that and are still committed to getting a color e-reader. Is the Kindle Colorsoft at least a good choice?\n\nI\u2019ve already gone over the higher contrast, and given that the rest of the competition pretty much looks the same, that means this is one of the better looking color E Ink screens yet. And while the 7-inch display is smaller than a physical comic book and is on par with the new Paperwhite\u2019s screen, it is slightly bigger than the 6.8-inch screen on the last generation Kindle models, so that\u2019s another improvement. Its screen resolution (300 PPI for b&w content and 150 PPI for color) is industry standard, as is its IPX8 waterproofing, and like on other premium e-readers, there\u2019s an adjustable front light with warmth settings.\n\nYou do lose out on a stylus and page-turn buttons, things that are available on competitors like the Libra Colour, but you gain wireless charging, which I unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to test as it requires a special dock. There\u2019s also audiobook playback over Bluetooth\u2014I\u2019m not sure why you wouldn\u2019t just use your phone for this, but it\u2019s another industry standard feature\u2014and a promised 94 nits of max brightness, which is on par with previous generations, as is the weight (207g on my 2022 Paperwhite, and 217g on the Colorsoft).\n\nThe battery\u2019s supposed to last 8 weeks, which is long enough for me. While I didn\u2019t have that long to test it, I was only down to 78% charge after a week of regular use, complete with frequent reading at max brightness as well as use of wifi. If I had used the e-reader with the auto-brightness setting instead (or just at lower brightness), and in airplane mode (which is usually my go-to for e-readers), I could see it actually lasting longer than the promised time period.\n\nThere\u2019s also 32GB of storage, which is to be expected in this price range, and all-in-all, aside from the addition of color, it matches the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, and bests the cheaper standard Kindle Paperwhite, which lacks wireless charging and auto-brightness. That, combined with its improved display, does make it a good choice if you\u2019re set on a color e-reader and don\u2019t mind a lack of extras like physical buttons or a stylus. But there are two more big exceptions.",

The CPSC also said Amazon was legally responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and children's sleepwear that violates federal flammability standards.\n\nThe CPSC ruling and order came three years after it authorized an administrative complaint against Amazon that alleged it distributed certain products that could pose a danger to consumers. Amazon said its lawsuit comes in response to a final order filed by the CPSC on January 17.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.\n\n\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\nAmazon also alleges that the CPSC's structure is unconstitutional because it lets commissioners \"act as judge, jury and prosecutor in the same proceeding.\"\n\nAmazon declined to comment on its litigation, but a spokesperson said that the company had notified customers that they should stop using products flagged by the CPSC for recall and refunded them. Amazon launched a product recall page in 2023.\n\nThe CPSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConsumer Reports blasts Amazon\n\nA consumer group decried the company's legal maneuvering.\n\n\"It's absurd to suggest that because a company hosts a marketplace online it should be exempt from sensible requirements that help get hazardous products out of people's homes and prevent them from being sold,\" William Wallace, director of safety advocacy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement.\n\n\"What's even worse is that the company is attacking the legal foundation on which the CPSC rests,\" he added. \"Amazon's suit suggests the company thinks the people of the United States would be better off without an independent, bipartisan safety agency to enforce our laws and protect consumers from dangerous products.\"",

A representative with Scannell Properties, the real estate company spearheading the site plan proposal, declined to comment when reached by email.\n\nScannell Properties is an Indianapolis-based company that has spearheaded warehouse and distribution facilities for Amazon in a number of states.\n\nThe proposal, if approved, would build out a 107,000 square foot distribution facility on 22.94 acres of land in Essex\u2019s Saxon Hill Industrial Park off of Thompson Drive, according to Essex Development Review Board documents.\n\nThe project was reviewed last week by the town\u2019s Conservation and Trails Committee, which reviews all development applications in town and offers non-binding recommendations on projects.\n\nThe facility is being proposed in the town\u2019s Resource Preservation-Industrial district. Town zoning in the district requires that properties maintain a 50-foot buffer between the property and the street, said Ken Signorello, the chair of the town\u2019s conservation and trails committee.\n\nThe buffer is meant to to help with noise and light pollution, and maintain natural environments while preserving animal habitats, according to Shannon Jackson, the vice chair of the trails committee.\n\nBut Signorello and other trails committee members during their meeting said they were concerned about a request by Scannell Properties to waive the 50-foot buffer zone and instead build water retention ponds.\n\n\u201cObviously a lot of developers would like the ease of not having to keep this buffer and just clear-cutting everything,\u201d Jackson said in an interview. \u201cI was a big proponent that we demand or recommend that they do keep this buffer, that it is a standard of our town, and especially in this industrial zone, it\u2019s a requirement that such a buffer be kept for the beauty of our town.\u201d\n\nWhile the trails committee made recommendations to enforce the 50-foot buffer, ultimately the authority for final approval of the proposal lies with the town\u2019s Development Review Board.\n\nNonetheless, Signorello said he has concerns with the proposal.\n\nOne of the requirements of the zoning district, he said, \u201cis that development should be kept in harmony with nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this does not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s no effort being made to satisfy that requirement.\u201d\n\nAdditional details on the project\u2019s timeline were not available. Voicemails left with Essex\u2019s town planner and community development director were not returned.\n\nThe facility, if built out, would be the first Amazon facility in Vermont. Amazon has a growing presence in New England, with the company\u2019s largest facility in the region opening in 2023 in Windsor, Connecticut.\n\nIn January, the company announced it would be closing all of its warehouses in Quebec, affecting 1,700 full-time employees and 250 temporary workers.\n\nThe closure came less than a year after several hundred employees in Laval, Quebec moved to unionize their workplace. Amazon\u2019s decision to close its Quebec-based facilities drew the ire of local labor representatives, who suggested the company was flouting labor laws.",

            "content": "Securing your business email is more critical than ever in today\u2019s digital workplace. To help you protect your users and data in Amazon WorkMail (WorkMail), we regularly introduce security features that give organizations more control and protection for their business email. Thanks to the recently announced integration between WorkMail and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center (IAM IdC), WorkMail users can now enjoy single sign-on (SSO) via compatible 3rd party external identity providers including Okta Universal Directory (Okta), Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, JumpCloud, OneLogin, Ping Identity products and Active Directory.\n\nThis blog post explains the specific steps needed to integrate WorkMail with Okta via IAM IdC. WorkMail customers who use other 3rd party identity providers that are compatible with IdC will also find this post useful alongside the AWS documentation for their specific identity source. Alternatively, WorkMail organization administrators who do not use an external identity provider, but wish to enable multi-factor-authentication (MFA) for WorkMail viaIAM IdC will find guidance in a different blog post.\n\nBy integrating WorkMail with Okta via IAM IdC, users benefit from the security, convenience, and familiarity of SSO when accessing their WorkMail inbox and calendars via the WorkMail web-app. WorkMail organization administrators benefit from the security and efficiency of managing WorkMail user additions, modifications, or removals via the Okta admin tools. More detailed information about this integration can be found in the IAM IdC documentation as well as in the WorkMail documentation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmail remains a critical business communication tool, yet it is also one of the most targeted entry points for cyber threats. A single compromised email account can expose sensitive business data, damage an organization\u2019s reputation, and serve as a gateway for further cyber attacks. As traditional username and password authentication becomes increasingly inadequate, organizations must adopt stronger access controls to protect their users and communications.\n\nYou can enhance your WorkMail organization\u2019s security and simplify user authentication with SSO and a familiar login experience by integrating WorkMail with IAM IdC and Okta. This (and similar) integrations provide a more seamless authentication experience and helps administrators enforce consistent security policies across their organization.\n\nThe integration between WorkMail, IAM IdC and Okta supports these industry standards:\n\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) \u2013 Which enables automated user provisioning and identity synchronization across systems and applications.\n\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) \u2013 Which provides secure authentication and authorization by exchanging identity and privilege information between identity providers and WorkMail.\n\nWorkMail authentication options\n\nWhen you first set up WorkMail, you use the built-in user directory which relies upon standard username | password authentication for the WorkMail web browser client as well as popular desktop and mobile email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail and Thunderbird.\n\nThe integration between IAM Identity Center and Okta uses the SCIM protocol to provision and map user attributes in Okta to named attributes in IAM IdC. Once enabled, user and group information from Okta is automatically synchronized with IAM IdC. IAM IdC in turn uses the SAML protocol to provide Okta users with a familiar and convenient SSO experience.\n\nAfter integrating IAM IdC with Okta, WorkMail uses:\n\nOkta SSO for users of the WorkMail web-app. Personal access tokens (PAT) for users of desktop &/or mobile email applications.\n\nPrerequisites for the WorkMail, IAM IdC and Okta integration\n\nAdmin access to an AWS account You can evaluate the integration in this post for a limited period of time using an AWS Free Tier Account\n\nAdmin access to an Amazon WorkMail Organization The integration uses the email domain that is configured as WorkMail\u2019s default\n\nAdmin access to Amazon IAM Identity Center Or admin access to the IdC organization account\n\nYour WorkMail and IAM Identity Center must be in the same AWS region\n\nIAM Role with the security credentials needed to deploy AWS infrastructure via the AWS CDK\n\nAdministrator access to a fully functional Okta Identity account populated with users and (optionally) group(s) that you want to integrate and synchronize with IAM IdC and WorkMail.\n\nAccess to the AWS Samples GitHub repository, where you\u2019ll find sample code that deploys via AWS CDK. This code sample deploys a customizable AWS Lambda initially configured to perform user synchronization between IAM IdC and WorkMail every 15 minutes.\n\nA source code editor such as Visual Studio Code with your AWS admin credentials.\n\nHigh-level Steps\n\nConfigure Identity Center (See our documentation for detailed information).

Switch WorkMail Authentication Mode to IAM IdC.\n\nDetailed Configuration Guidance\n\nThe instructions that follow walk you through the steps needed to integrate your Okta system with IAM IdC. Once IAM IdC is synchronizing with Okta, you\u2019ll integrate IAM IdC with WorkMail. This process will keep your WorkMail organization\u2019s users and groups synchronized with Okta. Once fully enabled, your WorkMail users will use their Otka SSO credentials to access the WorkMail web-client or a username and unique Personal Access Tokens to access desktop &/or mobile email clients. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nConfigure Okta integration with IAM Identity Center (these steps have been adapted from this blog post)\n\nOpen the Okta admin landing page in a new browser (tab).\n\nClick the Applications Section in the left menu. Click on Applications in the dropdown menu. Click Browse App Catalog.\n\nType AWS IAM Identity Center in the search box. Click on the app that matches AWS IAM Identity Center.\n\nClick Add Integration to initiate the integration process.\n\nType a memorable name (like Workshop AWS IAM Identity Center ) for the application label, and click Done.\n\nClick on the Sign On tab, scroll down to view SAML Signing Certificates.\n\nClick Actions to download the certificate to your local machine. Keep the Okta Admin dashboard Open, you will need the SAML information found here to configure IdC in the next section.\n\nConfigure AWS IAM IdC\n\nIn a new browser window (or tab), open the IAM IdC console in the same region as your WorkMail Organization (we\u2019re using us-east-1). If this is your first time accessing IAM IdC, you\u2019ll be greeted with the IdC console home page prompting you to \u201cEnable IAM Identity Center\u201d. Click Enable.\n\nCheck that you are in the correct region, click Enable (note \u2013 this will enable an Organization instance of IdC, which is recommended. If you want to use an Account instance of IdC, please see the documentation).\n\nOnce IdC has been enabled, scroll down to the IAM Identity Center setup section and click Confirm Identity Source.\n\nClick Actions, and select Change identity source from dropdown menu.\n\nSelect External identity provider and click Next.\n\nUpload the SAML certificate you downloaded from Okta (above, step xx) Open the Okta dashboard browser/tab. Under the SAML 2.0 configuration, scroll down and expand > More details.\n\nCopy the Sign on URL from Okta SAML and paste the URL into the IdP sign-in URL field in IdC. Copy the Issuer URL from Okta SAML and paste the URL into the IdP sign-in URL field in IdC. Click Next .\n\n\n\nType ACCEPT in the confirmation text box & click Change identity source.\n\nSwitch back to the IAM IdC console browser window/tab. On the Settings page, locate the Automatic provisioning information box, and then choose Enable. Leave this browser window/tab open as you\u2019ll need it to copy the values for the SCIM endpoint and Access token into Okta shortly (note \u2013 IdC Automatic provisioning uses SCIM protocol to provision users from Okta).\n\nReturn to the Okta admin dashboard (you should have left it open in another browser window or tab). Under IAM Identity Center applications, select the Workshop AWS IAM Identity Center and open the Provisioning tab. Under Integration, click Configure API Integration.\n\nSelect the checkbox next to Enable API integration to enable provisioning. Refer to the IAM IcC console browser window/tab you left open and copy (from IdC) and paste (into Okta) the values for:\n\nBase URL field \u2013 paste the IdC SCIM endpoint value (make sure there is no trailing forward slash at the end of the URL). API Token field, enter the Access token value. Import Groups should be checked\n\n\n\nClick Test API Credentials to verify the credentials entered are valid (the message AWS IAM Identity Center was verified successfully! should appear).\n\nSave. Under Settings, choose To App, click Edit and select Enable for Create Users, Update User Attributes and Deactivate Users. Click Save.\n\nIn the Okta admin dashboard\u2019s left-hand menu pane, click on Directory.\n\nChoose Groups to see the list of existing groups. Click on the Add Group button to create a new group called workmail_users. Fill in the required details for the new group, including: Group Name: Enter workmail_users for the group. Group Description (optional): Provide a description for the group\u2019s purpose ( WorkMail_users ). Save the New Group Reload the page to see the newly created group Click Assign people Add Okta users to the workmail_users group Click Save\n\n\n\nIn the Okta admin dashboard\u2019s left-hand menu pane, click on Applications and open the AWS IAM Identity Center application. Click the Assignments tab, choose Assign, then choose Assign to people. Choose the Okta users that you want to have access to WorkMail via IAM Identity Center app. For each user, click Assign, review the user info, and click Save then Go Back When all Okta users for whom you want WorkMail users created/synced have been assigned, click Done to start the process of provisioning the users into IAM Identity Center.\n\nOn the Assignments page, choose Assign, and then choose Assign to groups. Click the Okta group ( workmail_users ) that you want to have access to WorkMail via IAM Identity Center. Click Assign, review the selections, click Save and Go Back. Click Done. This starts the process of provisioning the users in the workmail_users group into IAM Identity Center. Choose the Push Groups tab. Choose the workmail_users group that contains all the users that you assigned to the IAM Identity Center app. If the group is not found in the list, choose the Find groups by name option by clicking (+)Push Groups Menu. Enter the group name ( workmail_users ) that you created in the previous step and select it from the search results Click Save. The group status changes to \u201cpushing\u201d then \u201cActive\u201d (this can take several minutes), once the Okta workmail_users group and all its members have been pushed to IAM Identity Center. Return to the browser window/tab with the IAM Identity Center console. In the left navigation, select Groups (or Users) (you should see the Group (or users) list that was just populated by the Okta \u201cpush\u201d action).\n\nEnable IAM Identity Center in Amazon WorkMail\n\nOpen a new browser window (tab) to the WorkMail console in the same region as IdC, and open your WorkMail Organization. In WorkMail\u2019s left navigation rail click Identity Center Click on Multi-factor authentication setup guide, Click Enable Identity Center, read the default configuration notice ,and click Enable\n\nUnder Identity Center Settings, click the Authentication mode tab and ensure it is set for WorkMail directory and Identity center (this is the default). This mode is needed for testing and to allow desktop & mobile email client users to retrieve their unique personal access tokens. Once the integration with IdC is successfully tested, and those WorkMail users who rely on desktop or mobile email clients for access have had the opportunity to login to the WorkMail web app to retrieve a PAT, you will change the Authentication mode to Identity center only.\n\nDeploy the sample solution from GitHub\n\nSolution prerequisites:\n\n\u2013 AWS Account\n\n\u2013 AWS IAM user with Administrator permissions\n\n\u2013 Python (> v3.x) and Pip fully installed and configured on your computer\n\n\u2013 AWS CLI (v2) installed and configured on your computer\n\n\u2013 AWS CDK (v2) installed and configured on your computer\n\n\u2013 Sample CDK project that creates and deploys an AWS Lambda in your AWS account to perform users synchronization between IAM IdC and WorkMail.\n\nThe instructions that follow guide you in deploying a sample solution for the AWS Samples Serverless-Mail repository that programmatically creates/syncs WorkMail users from IAM Identity Center using the AWS CDK CLI. The sample uses naming conventions used in this blog. For example, the Lambda only syncs those users found in the IdC Group named \"workmail_users\" . If your IdC group has a different name, or you want to sync multiple IdC groups with WorkMail, you will need to modify the sample code before proceeding. (BE AWARE: The sample code base is an Open Source starter project designed to provide a demonstration and a base to start from for specific use cases. It should not be considered fully Production-ready, nor should it be deployed in a production environment. Refer to the README.md and License.md for more information.)\n\nClone the sample project to your computer ( git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-mail/tree/main/idc_okta-workmail ). CD into the \u2018 idc_okta-workmail \u2018 directory. Create a virtual environment for packaging in Python (Docker must already be running locally) with python3 -m venv .venv Activate the virtual environment with source .venv/bin/activate Make sure cdk.json references the correct path to Python (by default cdk.json refers to .venv/bin/python app.py ). If you need to locate Python, run the which python command. Install the project dependencies with pip3 install -r requirements.txt Check the AWS CLI local credentials and region with aws sts get-caller-identity . If you need to change any parameter, run aws configure Prepare the `app.py` file by running python3 get-my-variables.py . The \u2018get-my-variables.py\u2019 script fetches the necessary variables from your AWS account and create the `app.py` file needed by the CDK. You may want to review the auto-generated ` app.py ` file for accuracy, especially if the AWS account has been used for other IdC or WorkMail related projects. The app.py file requires the following account variables: AWS accountId\n\nAWS Region \u2013 the region must be the same for IdC and WorkMail.\n\nIDENTITYSTORE_ID \u2013 \u2013 found in the Identity Center console under settings or via the AWS CLI aws identitystore list-groups --identity-store-id {identity_store_id}\n\nIDENTITY_CENTER_INSTANCE_ARN \u2013 found in the Identity Center console under settings or via the AWS CLI aws sso-admin list-instances\n\nIDENTITY_CENTER_APPLICATION_ARN \u2013 found in the Identity Center console under Applications or via the AWS CLI aws sso-admin list-applications --instance-arn {instance_arn} `\n\n` WORKMAIL_ORGANIZATION_ID \u2013 found in the WorkMail console under Organizations or via the AWS CLI aws workmail list-organizations\n\nOKTA_GROUP_ID_TO_ASSIGN_TO_WORKMAIL \u2013 found in the Identity Center console under Groups > General Information or via the AWS CLI aws identitystore list-groups --identity-store-id {identity_store_id} Bootstrap the package (this step may take several minutes to complete) with cdk bootstrap Synthesize the package (this step may take several minutes to complete) with cdk synthesize Deploy your package (this step may take several minutes to complete) with cdk deploy and follow the prompts in the AWS CDK CLI. Once deployment to your AWS account starts, you can view the deployment status in the CloudFormation console.\n\nConfirm WorkMail Authentication mode\n\nWorkMail\u2019s default Authentication mode should be set to WorkMail directory and Identity center. Don\u2019t change this yet. This mode will allow WorkMail web-app users to continue to login to the WorkMail client directly, without Okta SSO. WorkMail\u2019s Personal access token configuration default is set to active, and token lifespan set to 365 days. You can change this if your security needs differ from the default. PATs are used by desktop and mobile email clients to login to WorkMail. Leaving WorkMail\u2019s default Authentication mode set to WorkMail directory allows desktop and mobile email clients to continue to login to the WorkMail with their username and password, without yet requiring a PAT instead of password.\n\nConduct a few spot tests to verify WorkMail web-app users can properly access their WorkMail accounts via:\n\nThe Amazon WorkMail web application URL (found on the WorkMail organization page)\n\nYour organization\u2019s unique AWS access portal URL (found on the setting page of the IAM IdC dashboard).\n\nThis will open a new browser tab that redirects to the Okta user login page.\n\nOnce user has authenticated, this page will redirect to the AWS access portal with linked application tiles to all of the AWS applications that have been integrated with IAM Identity Center.\n\nClick on the WorkMail logo, and the WorkMail web-app will load.\n\nDesktop or mobile email software users need to create a WorkMail Personal Access Token (PAT) to access WorkMail. These users must retrieve their own PATs after logging into the WorkMail web-client. Open the Webmail login link found on the WorkMail Organization page under User Login\n\nIn the WorkMail web-app, click the settings gear (in top right) Click Personal Access token and enter a token name (i.e. desktop-thunderbird-pat ) Click Create token. Click Create token. Copy the token value (this is the only time you can retrieve this token value). Open your desktop or mobile email software, enter your username and your PAT (the PAT replaces your existing user password).\n\nIn settings, click Personal Access token and Create token Enter a token name (typically the device on which you\u2019ll use this PAT) and select create token. Copy the token value (this is the only time you can retrieve this token value). Open your desktop or mobile email software, enter your username and your PAT (the PAT replaces your existing user password), and test your new login (username | PAT).\n\nNotify your WorkMail users of upcoming changes to login procedures\n\nOnce you have tested the integration between WorkMail and IAM Identity Center with a few test users, you should prepare your WorkMail users for the increased login security. For example, you could send them an email that explains:\n\nThe organization is adding an additional login security step to help protect their inboxes.\n\nInform them that they should anticipate an email from the AWS IAM Identity Center with info about the upcoming implementation of MFA for web-app users and PATs for desktop and mobile client users.\n\nUsers should accept the invitation and create a new password for the AWS IAM Identity Center.\n\nInform them that once WorkMail MFA is enabled, all WorkMail web-app users will be required to use their username, password and MFA.\n\nInform them that once WorkMail PATs are enabled, all WorkMail desktop and mobile email client users will need to login to the WorkMail web client (with MFA) via the AWS access portal URL, create one PAT per software client (the same PAT can not be used on desktop and mobile). They then must update their desktop or mobile email software to use their username and PAT, instead of their current password. Explain that the PAT is now their email client application password and their personal desktop or mobile email software passwords will no longer work.\n\nProvide users with a way to request support.\n\nSwitch WorkMail Authentication Mode to Identity Center only\n\nOnce you are satisfied that your WorkMail users have incorporated Okta SSO and/or PATs into their WorkMail login routines, the WorkMail administrator should disable the WorkMail directory Authentication mode found in the WorkMail console under Organization > Identity Center.\n\nOptional \u2013 Ask several trusted users to test their ability to login to WorkMail web app via Okta credentials.\n\nCongratulations, your WorkMail organization\u2019s authentication is now being managed by IAM Identity Center and your external identity provider, Okta.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy integrating IAM Identity Center with Okta Identity and WorkMail, you can provide your users with the convenience of Okta SSO for the WorkMail web-app. This allows your organization to improve it\u2019s email security posture, better safeguard sensitive communications and protect you WorkMail organization against unauthorized access. Furthermore, this integration reduces admin overhead as user access to WorkMail is allowed, or revoked via the Okta administration dashboard.\n\nTake control of your email communications today with Amazon WorkMail:\n\nVisit the WorkMail Console to begin configuration. Enable IAM Identity Center Integration with Okta and WorkMail. Connect your WorkMail organization to centralized access management. Configure WorkMail to require: Okta SSO \u2013 Adds an extra layer of security for web-app users.

            "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency\u2019s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\n\nOn the FTC\u2019s website, the page hosting all of the agency\u2019s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden\u2019s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\n\nOne now deleted blog, titled \u201cHey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?\u201d explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant\u2019s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC\u2019s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled \u201c$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids\u2019 data: A game changer for COPPA compliance\u201d instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,\u201d a source familiar tells WIRED.\n\nAnother removed FTC blog titled \u201cThe Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust\u201d outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act\u2019s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for \u201cexcellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk\u2019s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general purpose government chatbot.\n\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.\n\nRemoving blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place \u201cwarning\u201d labels above previous administrations\u2019 public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.\n\nSince President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson\u2019s criticisms center around the Republican party\u2019s longstanding allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, the New York Times reported in December.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. \"If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,\u201d he said.\n\nSources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.\n\n\u201cThey are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,\u201d the source familiar alleges. \u201cI think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.\u201d",

We still have another four to go before we bid adieu to another episode of Big Smile Sale. Are you smiling, though? You likely would be if you managed to grab yourself a great bargain. Like I managed to. Mine is probably a lucky on \u2013 a pair of Skechers Slip-Ins I've had my eye on for a while. It had only a small discount, down to AU$89 with just a single pair in stock, according to Amazon, when the sale started. I wasn't quite prepared to pay that much, but I added it to my cart anyway yesterday morning and had placed my order that evening. It arrived today and I discovered that it was listed for AU$140 and shipping in from overseas. Yep, a lucky bargain. You'd be feeling rather good if you managed to pick up the Vornado fan and the Shark IZ102 cordless vacuum that we had listed yesterday \u2013 they both disappeared rather quickly. With the sale now beginning to age, it's probably not a good time to be indecisive \u2013 if you see a good deal (aka it's within your budget) and it's an item you've been holding out for, get it before stocks or the discount disappears. My and team and I will be back again tomorrow to help you find more good tech and tech-adjacent items. So stick with us for a while yet.\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears / Future) Bring the Megaboom! The Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 is powerful, portable Bluetooth speaker that will be the life of any situation it finds itself. It's a well overdue update to the eight-year old Megaboom 3 and introduces upgraded passive radiators for improved bass performance, making it ideal for parties. As with the previous speakers in the series, the Megaboom 4 delivers sound in a full 360\u00ba and still comes in a selection of vibrant, fun colours. It can daisy chain with other UE speakers via the smartphone app and fans of the series will appreciate the update to USB-C charging. I'm a sucker for good Bluetooth speaker and the Ultimate Ears range, particularly the Megaboom, has always been among my favourites. It's capable of kicking out clean, detailed sound that's free from distortion and the oversized volume buttons have continue to be an iconic touch. I've not seen a discount on the Megaboom 4 before \u2013 those are usually reserved for smaller, less powerful Boom 4 \u2013 so this AU$101 saving at Amazon is something to shout about. Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4: was AU$349.95 now AU$248.95 at Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Dyson) A cheap Dyson for just AU$410 \u2013 yes please! The Dyson V8 is now the British brand's entry-level model, with the V7 out of production for a while. It's not what we'd call 'cheap', but then no Dyson really is. Still, with a 49% discount, it's hard to pass this offer up on Amazon. There are various editions of the V8 and this particular model is the base/standard one, which gets you the Digital Motorbar along with three other attachments in the box. It's a slightly updated motor compared to the original V8 that was released way back when, so it is a little bit more powerful in comparison, but you are still stuck with a battery that offers no more than 40 minutes of runtime. If your home is small enough for that, and you don't need the workhorses that are Dyson's newer, more powerful \u2013 and, thus, more expensive \u2013 cordless vacuums, then the V8 for just under AU$410 is not a bad buy at all. Dyson V8: was AU$799 now AU$409.99 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Future) Take to the skies with the DJI Mini 3 While it might have been succeeded by the Mini 4 Pro, the DJI Mini 3 is still one of TechRadar's favourite compact drone. The RC version \u2013 which is bundled with the DJI remote controller with the screen \u2013 is now reduced from AU$939 to just AU$748. It's not the very cheapest we have seen, but still a pretty good deal. This backpack-friendly \u2013 and dare I say wallet-friendly \u2013 drone weighs just under 250g, which means it doesn't need to be registered with CASA for flying, but it would be advisable that you read all the guidelines carefully before flying your first drone.\n\n\n\nWant to know more?

It's been common in the past years to see Kindle ereaders get very good discounts during Amazon sales, even Big Smile Sale. However, I was disappointed last year to see that Kindles aren't getting the same discount treatment as, say, the Echo smart home devices. And that is very strange. I understand that Kindles are far more popular and people would be willing to purchase them at their full RRP, but the 2024 range isn't cheap, and they're not the upgrades to warrant the kind of price hike Amazon has slapped onto them. The only way to score a Kindle discount right now on Amazon is to pick up a bundle. Here are some examples below: Kindle Essentials Bundle (tablet, fabric case, power adaptor): AU$278.90 AU$258.90\n\nAU$258.90 Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (tablet, fabric cover, power adaptor): AU$388.90 AU$348.90\n\nAU$348.90 Kindle (2024) + Echo Dot 5: AU$298 AU$268 Those discounts are barely anything! You don't need a power adaptor to charge your Kindle, I'm quite sure you already have at least one spare at home somewhere. And without Audible support in Australia, the bundled Echo Dot 5 in the last option is just a smart speaker that's already discounted anyway. What's happening, Amazon? A cheap Kindle deal would be lovely, thanks!\n\n\u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Ears / Logitech) UE Bluetooth speaker deals \u2013 music to our ears\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a high-quality Bluetooth speaker, Ultimate Ears has some fantastic deals right now. Whether you need something portable, party-ready, or packed with power, there\u2019s an option to suit. Here are the best discounts I\u2019ve found today.\n\n\n\nThe Ultimate Ears EPICBOOM is one of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy, and right now, you can save AU$160.95. It\u2019s my top pick for outdoor use, with room-filling audio and a strong, durable design. The companion app also adds some useful features to fine-tune your sound.\n\n\n\nThe MEGABOOM 4 is another standout, now AU$102.25 off. It\u2019s slim, stylish, and portable, with an impressive 20-hour battery life. Thanks to its cylindrical design, it pumps sound out in all directions, making it an excellent choice for any space. If you\u2019ve been wanting a high-quality on-the-go speaker, this is a deal worth considering.\n\n\n\nFor those who want serious power, the Ultimate Ears HYPERBOOM is down AU$150. This gigantic speaker is built to deliver rich, room-filling sound. It\u2019s heavy and a bit pricey, but in our Ultimate Ears HYPERBOOM review we loved the sound quality and sleek design, and it's a great choice for bigger spaces or outdoor gatherings.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 is still a solid option, despite a fairly meager discount. While you can only save AU$29, this classic speaker boasts epic battery life and punchy sound. We even awarded it a TechRadar Recommends seal of approval, and it still holds up today.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve been eyeing an Ultimate Ears speaker, now\u2019s the time to grab one at a discount.\n\nUltimate Ears EPICBOOM: was AU$499.95 now AU$339 on Amazon\n\nUltimate Ears MEGABOOM 4: was AU$349.95 now AU$247.7 on Amazon\n\nUltimate Ears HYPERBOOM: was AU$599 now AU$449 on Amazon\n\nUltimate Ears MEGABOOM 3: was AU$254 now AU$225 on Amazon\n\n\u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Nespresso / Future) Capsule coffee convenience with Creatista Coffee machines don\u2019t get more foolproof than the capsule variety \u2013 just pop a pod in, press a button and you have a delicious brew in seconds. Nespresso is undoubtedly the king of pod coffee machines and they don\u2019t get much better than the Vertuo Creatista \u2013 we rate is as the best Nespresso machine in our guide to the best coffee machines in Australia \u2013 which gets a tasty AU$301 discount during Amazon's Big Smile Sale. The Vertuo Creatista is one of the most premium coffee machines you can get from Nespresso \u2013 made in partnership with Breville \u2013 and, as the name implies, it uses the Vertuo line of coffee pods. These come in a multitude of different sizes from single-shot espresso all the way through to 230ml mugs. The machine reads the unique barcode on each pod to determine how much water to use and how long to extract it for, resulting in a perfect cuppa every single time. The Creatista also has a built-in milk frother with three selectable temperatures and three foam levels. All you need to do is choose your preference, press a button and you\u2019ll have expertly frothed milk to top off your coffee and practice your latte art. This isn't the lowest price we've ever seen on this machine, but it is the lowest we can currently find. Nespresso Vertuo Creatista: was AU$1,099 now AU$798 on Amazon\n\n\u2191 Go back up\n\nTravel with Trtl I know this is a tech a site, but I just absolutely have to share one of the best things you can buy, particularly if you're a frequent traveller who can't travel first or business class. It's the Trtl Travel Pillow! I bought it in 2024 during Prime Day in July and cannot recommend it highly enough \u2013 it's the best money I spent on myself considering I usually have to endure a 12-hour flight when I visit family on the Subcontinent. The Trtl Travel Pillow isn't exactly a pillow \u2013 it's more a scarf with a curve piece of plastic inside it. But that plastic can support your head and neck really well and allows you sleep sitting upright and waking up without a crink in your neck. I'm short and pleasantly plump and don't think I have much of a neck at all and yet it's comfortable to wear. Although keeping my headphones on while wearing it can be a challenge. Do yourself a favour, fellow traveller, and invest in one if you haven't already. Trtl Travel Pillow: was AU$94.99 now AU$76 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Future) Eyes on the road with the Miofive S1 dash cam You don't need us to tell you Australia's roads can be dangerous, but what we can tell you is that having a dash cam installed in your car can provide an extra layer of safety should anything bad happen...and it not be your fault, of course. The Miofive S1 Pro is a fantastic, affordable option that includes a rear-facing camera to keep an eye on what's going on behind you, along with the road ahead. The Miofive S1 currently claims a spot in our list of the best dash cams, and the S1 Pro model we're talking about here simply refers to the fact it comes with that secondary camera. The front-facing camera supports 4K video recording for clear visuals, even at night, while the rear camera records in 2K quality. The S1 Pro even features built-in GPS \u2013 a feature that's often reserved for much more expensive models. A 5GHz Wi-Fi connection allows for fast transfers of footage to your smartphone, or you can install the included 32GB microSD card for storing content on the device itself. And, with the addition of a hardwiring kit (sold separately) the Miofive S1 Pro can record around the clock to help catch anything that might knock into your pride and joy while you're away from it. \u2022 Miofive S1 Pro dash cam: was AU$159.98 now AU$123.99 at Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Future) Snap-happy deal: Nikon Z6 III camera at a great price The Nikon Z6 III melds an incredibly compelling price with cutting edge features like the world's first partially stacked sensor and vastly improved autofocus. For both stills and video it's a superb choice currently \u2013 not least because it's capable of extremely rapid burst rates and 6K video at a price point that's unparalleled. There's a reason why we've ranked the Nikon Z6 III at the very top of our best mirrorless cameras list as the best all-rounder right now. So, If you're on the hunt for a next-gen camera upgrade for your flagging Z6 Mark 1 or even a DSLR, then do yourself a favour and check out this deal on Amazon \u2013 there's a decent 27% off the body. It was 28% off not that long ago, but it's still very worth it at this slightly higher price. This fantastic mirrorless camera was released a few months ago and features an impressive 24.5MP partially full-frame stacked sensor with vastly improved autofocus and 6K video at up to 60fps. Our Nikon Z6 III review awarded this excellent camera a full five stars out of five so today's price cut gets a glowing recommendation from me who, as a photographer myself, switched camps from Canon to Nikon just a year ago.

We were expecting Amazon to kick off this year's Big Smile Sale to kick off at 12pm AEDT today, but the online retailer jumped its own gun. We saw the deals live at 7am AEDT when we started working. It's a good idea to pace ourselves though. Not only will you be able to shop on Amazon until Sunday, March 23, but Afterpay Day 2025 is coming on March 20 too. That's a lot of deals to check out and we'll, of course, help you sort through those as well. So hold your horses, folks, there'll be plenty more deals to come over the next few days. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning to bring you more live coverage of the Amazon Big Smile Sale 2025. Perhaps we'll see some good Kindle deals that have eluded us today? We'll have to wait and see.\n\n(Image credit: Sony / TechRadar) Big-screen thrills with the 85-inch Sony X90L It's no secret that TV makers are going bigger and bigger with their screen sizes. If you value your TV viewing time at home, and you have the space, then bigger really is better and this Sony 85-inch TV is one helluva screen. It is a 2023 model, but don't let that put you off. Not only does Sony tend to release its TVs in a more staggered fashion compared to the rest of the competition, but its televisions are often so good, that they don't need replacing \u2013 this X90L is a testament to that. We gave it a glowing 4.5-stars in our Sony X90L review, praising it for its high brightness that can rival some mini LED TVs. What we mean by that is that the X90L uses a regular LED backlight and not the fancier and inherently brighter mini LED tech, so for it to comfortably compete is high praise indeed for Sony's engineers. Couple this with Sony's excellent Cognitive Processor XR and local dimming smarts, and you're rewarded with a gorgeous, natural-looking picture with great colour and contrast. So, not only will it bring the cinema into your front room, but it's also a great option for gamers thanks to full 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision gaming support. Only two of its four HDMI inputs supports the 2.1 standard required for the PS5 and Xbox Series X, but given a majority of other brands adopt the same, it's not a huge negative against the X90L. \u2022 Sony X90L (85-inch): was AU$5,299 now AU$3,281 at Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n(Image credit: Sennheiser / Futre) Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless (Special Edition) deal We're massive fans of the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless headphones here at TechRadar.

It's headline is the whopping 60-hour battery life!\n\n\n\nBetter yet, these fantastic headphones \u2013 in the Special Edition Copper version specifically \u2013 have dropped to a great price on Amazon for Big Smile Day, shaving off a massive 40% from the RRP.\n\n\n\nEven though it's not the SE version, it's worth checking out our Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review.

Hopefully our readers who were keen on the fan have been able to snap one up before the offer disappeared. Every time we see a discount on Vornado fans, we have to write about it. They're all powerful enough to make the Aussie summer more bearable, but this particular model takes things a step further. The Vornado 633DC fan promises to be 80% more energy efficient, potentially saving you a little cash on your electricity bill through the hot months. Moreover, it offers up 99 speed settings. That means you get even more precise controls \u2013 not too blustery and not too slow, you'll be able to find your sweet spot of air circulation for any hot and humid day. Better yet, this more advanced Vornado is now 27% off, making it quite the budget buy for a fan.

Enter the Samsung SmartTags. The second generation is still going strong in Australia, and they're actually cheaper to buy than AirTags. For Big Smile Sale, a pack of 4 Samsung SmartTag 2 Bluetooth trackers are available for AU$99 \u2013 that's a massive 41% discount on the list price, and brings the price of each individual ones down to just AU$24.75. In contrast, a 4-pack of Apple AirTags typically will set you back about AU$128 at best \u2013 although currently down to AU$135 on Amazon \u2013 so each tracker will be around AU$32. So if you want decent Bluetooth trackers to keep tabs on your belongings (or pets) that are economical and can be used via the SmartThings app, grab this 4-pack.

You can get some really affordable options, but I think the Fire TV Stick 4K (2023) is arguably the best option of them all \u2013 not too expensive but full-featured.\n\n\n\nWhile any streaming device will give you access to practically all platforms, plus some other apps too, the Fire TV Stick 4K stands out by offering a speedy navigation system, great performance, support for 4K resolution and Dolby Vision. It's also controllable via the Alexa voice assistant.\n\n\n\nIt's also Wi-Fi 6 enabled, plus you'll get access to Xbox Game Pass via the device to play your favourite games. That's a lot of features for not a lot of money. Amazon has slashed the price of the Fire TV Stick 4K by 30%, so you can pick it up for just AU$69. And sure, we have seen it at 50% in the past, but this is still a solid deal.\n\n\n\nFire TV Stick 4K: was AU$99 now AU$69 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\nFocus on this: 23% off the Canon EOS R6 Mark II (Image credit: Future) I'm a photographer and had been a Canon girl for over a decade. Then the Nikon Z8 happened and I switched allegiances, but Canon still gives me major FOMO, especially when I think about the EOS R5 Mark II. It's such a fantastic camera that I do regret splurging on the Nikon. The R5 II is, however, rather expensive. If that's the kind of performance you're after, but at a more achievable price, consider the Canon EOS R6 Mark II instead. Sure, it's not a high-resolution sensor, but its speed and precision belies its price tag. For your money, you get a 24.2MP full-frame sensor that's capable of excellent images even when rattling away at 40fps continuous shooting. There are very good tracking modes, so you can use it for sports or wildlife photography, and videos are oversampled 6K clips. And having followed the price history of this camera since its launch in November 2022, this is one of the best prices yet! Canon EOS R6 Mark II (body only): was AU$3,299 now AU$2,554 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\nA Bose bargain! (Image credit: Future) If you aren't too fussed about missing out on Bose's fancy Immersive Audio, but still want a fantastic set of headphones for not a huge amount of money, the Bose QuietComfort SC is a great buy. Even better, it's AU$50 cheaper than we saw during the Black Friday sales last year. Other than that, the main difference between the SC and the Ultra is the quality of materials used \u2013 for example, the Ultra has a little more cushioning for the earcups, but the SC are still very comfy. It's also a folding design, which you won't get with the Ultra, and it comes in a soft case as compared to the Ultra's hard one (the SC in the name denotes the 'soft case'). Both have lovely sound, although the Ultras will be a touch better as they process sound differently to the SC, while battery life and ANC performance is quite similar on both. So if you want to save some cash but not skimp on sound, you can grab the SC for under AU$250 Bose QuietComfort SC: was AU$499.95 now AU$249 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n15% off PSN gift cards (Image credit: Sony) To get things going, we have to begin with the PlayStation Store gift cards. This is your chance to treat yourself to a brand-new blockbuster game for less as Amazon is shaving 15% off PlayStation Store gift cards. With amounts ranging from AU$10 to AU$135 \u2013 which drop to AU$8.50 and AU$114.75 respectively \u2013 you can have your pick of the top games you still haven't played on your PlayStation. For example, you could grab the AU$135 gift card for under AU$115, then get yourself Monster Hunter Wilds for AU$114.95 and and pay just 20c extra out of pocket. There are also a handful of games being discounted on the PlayStation Store right now, with up to 75% off the likes of Spider-Man 2, Rise of the Ronin and Astro Bot.

And having followed the price history of this camera since its launch in November 2022, this is one of the best prices yet! Canon EOS R6 Mark II (body only): was AU$3,299 now AU$2,554 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\nA Bose bargain! (Image credit: Future) If you aren't too fussed about missing out on Bose's fancy Immersive Audio, but still want a fantastic set of headphones for not a huge amount of money, the Bose QuietComfort SC is a great buy. Even better, it's AU$50 cheaper than we saw during the Black Friday sales last year. Other than that, the main difference between the SC and the Ultra is the quality of materials used \u2013 for example, the Ultra has a little more cushioning for the earcups, but the SC are still very comfy. It's also a folding design, which you won't get with the Ultra, and it comes in a soft case as compared to the Ultra's hard one (the SC in the name denotes the 'soft case'). Both have lovely sound, although the Ultras will be a touch better as they process sound differently to the SC, while battery life and ANC performance is quite similar on both. So if you want to save some cash but not skimp on sound, you can grab the SC for under AU$250 Bose QuietComfort SC: was AU$499.95 now AU$249 on Amazon \u2191 Go back up\n\n15% off PSN gift cards (Image credit: Sony) To get things going, we have to begin with the PlayStation Store gift cards. This is your chance to treat yourself to a brand-new blockbuster game for less as Amazon is shaving 15% off PlayStation Store gift cards. With amounts ranging from AU$10 to AU$135 \u2013 which drop to AU$8.50 and AU$114.75 respectively \u2013 you can have your pick of the top games you still haven't played on your PlayStation. For example, you could grab the AU$135 gift card for under AU$115, then get yourself Monster Hunter Wilds for AU$114.95 and and pay just 20c extra out of pocket. There are also a handful of games being discounted on the PlayStation Store right now, with up to 75% off the likes of Spider-Man 2, Rise of the Ronin and Astro Bot.

            "content": "NBCUniversal said it would move an Upfront Week party for Spanish-language network Telemundo to a new night, weeks after Amazon said it would encroach on the evening upon which the event has traditionally been held.\n\nTelemundo for years has held an event for advertisers on the first night of Upfront Week, a five-day whirlwind of presentations by U.S. TV companies to Madison Avenue. The networks hope to sell the bulk of their commercial inventory ahead of the debut of their next cycle of programming.\n\nFor years, NBCU and Fox have held events on the Monday of the week, with a Telemundo concert taking place later in the evening. Amazon said in January it planned to make its own pitch to advertisers Monday night \u2014 no matter the effects on NBCU and Fox. After protesting Amazon\u2019s maneuver at the time, NBCU is now planning to move its Telemundo party, according to a person familiar with the matter, to Tuesday evening.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nExecutives felt Amazon\u2019s move was \u201cunfortunate,\u201d according to a person familiar with the matter, and wanted to find a way for clients to connect with Telemundo without having to make sacrifices in their schedules. Telemundo will be discussed at the NBCU upfront on Monday, with a party, billed as \u201can intimate experience\u201d held for \u201ca select group of clients\u201d on Tuesday evening.\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s upfront event will take place Monday, May 12, at 10:30 a.m. at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\n\nNBCU indicated that it would focus heavily on sports and live events. In a memo, Mark Marshall, the chairman of NBCU\u2019s ad sales and partnerships unit, vowed to \u201cpresent the greatest collection of content that has ever been assembled by one media company.\u201d NBCU is already talking to advertisers about supporting Super Bowl LX, NBC\u2019s new NBA package and the 2026 Winter Olympics \u2014 all of which are set to air in an early-winter window next year. The list of tentpole events also includes the FIFA World Cup, Premier League, BravoCon and the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nIn an era when more people are moving to streaming services to watch scripted programs at moments of their own choosing, sports and big events are getting more of a spotlight. NBCU\u2019s pitch is that it has a roster of important events that will help advertisers reach the audiences they need. \u201cConnecting with consumers in this overstimulated environment is today\u2019s version of a moonshot,\u201d said Marshall. \u201cAs targeting becomes table stakes, what drives real results for your brand is engagement \u2014 deep and meaningful engagement seamlessly integrated into an authentic and impactful environment for your brands.\u201d\n\nNBCU will hold an upfront just as the company is in the midst of spinning off many of its best known cable networks into a new entity. Nonetheless, the upfront is likely to highlight red-carpet events on E! and golf events on Golf Channel.\n\nAdvertisers have begun to favor streaming over linear TV. Ad commitments for the next cycle of primetime broadcast TV fell 3.5% in last year\u2019s \u201cupfront\u201d market, to $9.34 billion, according to Media Dynamics Inc., while commitments for primetime on cable tumbled 4.8%, to $9.065 billion. Meanwhile, ad commitments to streaming video hubs rose a noticeable 35.3%, hiking to $11.1 billion from $8.2 billion in the previous market. The amount committed to streaming video for the next TV season was greater than that devoted to primetime broadcast or primetime cable \u2014 a first for the industry.\n\nWhile NBCU pushed back on Amazon\u2019s move to Mondays, the company may stir up some new rancor with its Telemundo maneuver. Disney typically holds forth on Tuesday evenings during each Upfront Week.",

            "content": "Amazon\u2019s AI-enhanced Alexa assistant is going to need all your voice recordings, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. An email sent to Alexa users notes the online retail giant is ending one of its few privacy provisions about recorded voice data in the lead up to Alexa+. The only way to make sure Amazon doesn\u2019t get ahold of any of your vocals may be to quit using Alexa entirely.\n\nYou can find the full email on Reddit (as first reported by Ars Technica), which plainly states the \u201cDo Not Send Voice Recordings\u201d setting on Alexa is being discontinued on March 28. Anybody who has the setting enabled will have it automatically revoked, and Amazon will then be able to process your voice recordings. Amazon claims it will delete the recordings once it\u2019s done processing your request.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon\u2019s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature,\u201d the email reads. \u201cIf you do not take action, your Alexa Settings will automatically be updated to \u2018Don\u2019t save recordings.\u2019 This means that, starting on March 28, your voice recording will be sent to and processed in the cloud, and they will be deleted after Alexa processes your requests. any previously saved voice recordings will also be deleted.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cDo Not Send Voice Recordings\u201d feature was available on the latest Echo Dot along with the Echo Show 10 and Echo Show 15 in the U.S. This processed audio on device, rather than the cloud. After March 28, the devices will no longer save any voice recordings.\n\nIn an email statement sent to Gizmodo, an Amazon spokesperson said Alexa is designed to protect customers\u2019 privacy \u201cand that\u2019s not changing.\u201d The spokesperson added, \u201cCustomers can continue to choose from a robust set of tools and controls, including the option to not save their voice recordings at all.\u201d\n\nAlexa+, Amazon\u2019s upcoming AI version of its normally inconsistent voice assistant, is supposed to allow for far more utility than it had in the past. The new assistant should be able to order groceries via multiple apps including Amazon Fresh and Instacart for you based on broad requests like \u201cget me all the ingredients I need to make a pizza at home.\u201d It\u2019s supposed to set smart home routines, access your security footage, and look for Prime Video content in a conversational manner. The other big headline feature is Voice ID, where Amazon claims Alexa can identify who is speaking to it. The AI theoretically should learn users\u2019 habits over time and tailor its responses to each individual.\n\nAlexa+ is supposed to come to all current Echo Show devices and will supposedly make its way to future Echo products as well. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you\u2019ll get immediate access to Alexa+. Without the subscription, you\u2019ll need to cough up another $20 a month for the sake of talking to AI-infused Alexa. Bloomberg reported Monday that the company wanted more \u201cpremium\u201d smart home products for Alexa+, some of which could process more requests on-device. Still, that won\u2019t be all requests, and more complicated tasks will still require cloud-based AI processing.\n\nThere are more than a few reasons you don\u2019t want Amazon anywhere near your voice data. For years, Amazon\u2019s default setting gave workers access to user data, even offering some the ability to listen to users\u2019 Alexa recordings. In 2023, the company paid out $25 million to the Federal Trade Commission over allegations it gave employees access to children\u2019 s voice data and Ring camera footage. For its part, Amazon said it had changed its data practices to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, aka COPPA. Amazon\u2019s privacy track record is spotty, at best. The company has long been obsessed with users\u2019 voice data. In 2023, Amazon revealed it was using Alexa voice recordings to help train its AI. The company did not clarify whether users\u2019 voice recordings were still being used for training AI.\n\nUnlike Apple, which made big claims about data protections with its \u201cprivate cloud compute\u201d system for processing cloud-based AI requests anonymously, Amazon has made far fewer overtures to keeping user data safe. Smaller AI models can run on-device, but those few examples we have of on-device capabilities from the likes of Windows Copilot+ laptops or Gemini on Samsung Galaxy S25 phones are\u2014in their current iteration\u2014little more than gimmicks. Alexa+ wants to be the first instance of true assistant AI with cross-app capabilities, but it may also prove a privacy nightmare from a company that has routinely failed to protect users\u2019 data.\n\nUpdate 03/17/25 at 2:40 p.m. ET: This post was updated to include a statement from Amazon and more information on Amazon\u2019s future hardware plans.",

Here's what to know.\n\nKohl's stops accepting Amazon returns in test. Are any in Ohio?\n\nPer Modern Retail, several Kohl's stores in Massachusetts, Missouri, Washington and Wisconsin are no longer accepting Amazon returns. The change began last week at some stores.\n\nA Kohl's spokesperson told the publication that it was a temporary test, but would not say how many stores are affected by the change, or how long it would last.\n\n\u201cTo continue to learn from our customers, we are conducting a test in a handful of our stores where we will be temporarily discontinuing the third-party returns service,\u201d the Kohl\u2019s spokesperson told Modern Retail. \u201cKohl\u2019s has a test and learn culture that helps us to evolve our store experience and stay informed about customers expectations and preferences.\u201d\n\nOn Reddit, Kohl's employees write that the company is expected to monitor the test for 90 days to see how it affects business. One comment on the thread called Amazon returns \"a headache\" that \"can't be worth\" the time and effort. Another doubts the change will affect Kohl's sales.\n\n\"The Amazon return people aren't becoming new Kohl's shoppers, they don't even view us as a real store; they treat us like the UPS store, where you drop off your package and get out of there,\" the commenter writes.\n\nKohl's and Amazon partnership began in 2017, rolled out nationwide in 2019\n\nKohl's tested accepting Amazon returns in 2017 at stores in California and Wisconsin before rolling out the program nationwide, according to the Daily Mail (via MSN).\n\nThe program was meant to boost Kohl's sales and drive foot traffic at stores, while giving Amazon shoppers a more convenient place to bring returns. Until now, Amazon shoppers have been able to bring returns to any U.S. Kohl's stores, except the one in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n'We're really going to just continue to be focused on all of our initiatives to drive traffic, and Amazon is obviously one of those key items, Sephora being another one,' Kohl's CFO Jill Timm said at the time of the rollout, the Daily Mail reports.\n\nIn a 2021 earnings call, Kohl's confirmed it gained 2 million customers in the partnership.\n\nKohl's sales drop 7% for 2024; retailer to close 'underperforming' stores\n\nHowever, during its most recent earnings call in February, Kohl's reported that its net sales have decreased by 7.2% year-over-year.\n\nAnticipating that decline, Kohl's announced in January it would close 27 \"underperforming\" stores in 15 states by April, the Enquirer previously reported, including two in the Cincinnati area: Blue Ash at 4150 Hunt Road, and Forest Mills at 100 Cincinnati Mills Drive. The closures are a fraction of Kohl's 1,100-plus stores nationwide.\n\nRoughly two weeks later, Kohl's announced it had cut about 10% of its corporate workforce, USA TODAY reported. About half of the total cuts came from eliminating open positions, Kohl's said. Less than 200 employees were laid off, according to the company, which didn't provide a specific number.\n\n\"The real estate closures and the corporate workforce reduction are both actions to support our commitments to increase efficiencies and improve profitability in the business for the long-term benefit of our associates and customers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nHow many stores does Kohl's have in Ohio\n\nKohl's operates more than 1,150 stores nationwide, and has 60 in Ohio, including one each in Akron and North Canton, five in Cincinnati (including Forest Park), and two in Columbus.\n\nKohl's joins Joann Fabrics, Macy's, Big Lots, JCPenney in closing stores\n\nBig Lots joins several other national retailers in filing bankruptcy and closing stores in 2025.

Another major change Buchanan is pushing is for Kohl's to reduce the number companies on its promotions exclusion list.\n\nA spokesman from Amazon confirmed the discontinuation of returns at some Kohl's stores, but said Kohl's is still a return partner.\n\n\u201cAmazon provides convenient, hassle-free returns,\" Amazon said in a statement.\n\n\"We offer a broad range of convenient return options, and four out of five Amazon customers in the U.S. live within a five-mile radius of one of our more than 8,000 drop-off locations at Amazon\u2019s physical stores such as Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go, as well as partners including Staples, Kohl\u2019s, and The UPS Store.\u201d\n\nModern Retailer reported that stores in Eau Claire, Leominster, Mass. and Washington, Mo. are involved in the test.\n\nKohl\u2019s started accepting Amazon returns in October 2017 as a way to get people in the stores, and by 2019 the company expanded the service to nearly every store.\n\nAt the time the partnership with Amazon was viewed as a big move for Kohl's, one that some experts believed would positively impact the company.\n\nBut in the years since the deal was struck, Kohl's has not seen the increase it anticipated. On March 11 Kohl's reported a sales decline, the 12th quarter in a row which the company saw a decline.",

Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cAs we continue to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon\u2019s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.\u201d\n\nStarting on March 28, voice recordings from the Amazon Echo will be sent to and processed in the cloud \u2014 though the email said that \u201cthey will be deleted after Alexa processes your requests.\u201d\n\nHowever, the email also noted that if the Echo\u2019s settings are set to \u201cDon\u2019t save recordings,\u201d Voice ID will not work. According to Ars Technica, Voice ID allows users to access more personalized features on Alexa, such as sharing user-specified calendar events, reminders, music and more.\n\n\u201cThus, in order to keep that functionality, users will have to manually change that setting as well,\u201d Ars Technica reported.\n\nEssentially, everything said to your Amazon Echo from March 28 on will be sent to Amazon\u2019s cloud, and having the setting to make Amazon delete recordings will lessen the functionality of features on the device that were available by default when purchased.\n\nThe feature was only available on three Echo devices: Echo Dot (4th Gen), Echo Show 10 and Echo Show 15. Gado via Getty Images\n\nHowever, Amazon clarified to The Post that \u201cDo Not Send Voice Recordings\u201d was an opt-in feature that was only available to customers in the US with devices set to English. They claimed that less than 0.03% of customers used the feature.\n\nThe feature was also only available on three Echo devices: Echo Dot (4th Gen), Echo Show 10 and Echo Show 15.\n\n\u201cThe Alexa experience is designed to protect our customers\u2019 privacy and keep their data secure, and that\u2019s not changing. We\u2019re focusing on the privacy tools and controls that our customers use most and work well with generative AI experiences that rely on the processing power of Amazon\u2019s secure cloud,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to The Post.\n\n\u201cCustomers can continue to choose from a robust set of tools and controls, including the option to not save their voice recordings at all. We\u2019ll continue learning from customer feedback, and building privacy features on their behalf.\u201d\n\nThe move comes on the heels of the company\u2019s unveiling of its new Alexa with a complete AI overhaul, called Alexa+.\n\nCustomers on Reddit were not happy with the announcement, with many commenting expressing their disappointment.\n\n\u201cAs a blind person this is really frigging angry-making as voice control of apps is especially useful and important in terms of access,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cAlexa has been a game changer for our super adhd household. I\u2019m really not looking forward to dismantling it,\u201d someone added.\n\n\u201cSo I now have to worry my Echo is recording everything,\u201d another exasperated customer said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to unplug and trash my Alexa right now!\u201d one commented.",

            "content": "March (finally) brought about the beginning of daylight saving time, which means longer days, more sun, and extra time to find the hottest shopping finds. We're not even halfway through the month but have already come across a range of beauty and cleaning products that we think should be a welcome addition to everyone's daily routine during spring.\n\nTo share the reasons why some of our favorites are so game-changing, Shop TODAY contributor, TV host and lifestyle editor Chassie Post stopped by Studio 1A with the top Amazon bestsellers that are trending this March. From a skin tint that can adjust to any skin tone to a de-clogging tool that will have you more than ready for spring cleaning, check out all our must-have items below.\n\nAmazon March bestsellers seen on TODAY\n\nIf there's one multitasking product Post recommends adding to your beauty routine, it's this tinted moisturizer. It's got you covered in so many areas: hydration, UV protection (SPF 46!), coverage, anti-aging and more. But what really sets this must-have apart is its universal shading, meaning the formula self-adjusts to any and every skin tone, per the brand. Whether worn alone or under makeup, this tint offers a filter-like finish that will even work to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nWith so many dry shampoos on the market right now, we want to help you make the best choice for your hair. Post guarantees that this one from IGK formula is top-notch, especially if you're looking to revive second- (or third ... or fourth?) day hair. She says it erases any visible remnants of dirt and oil without making your strands feel dry and brittle, or leaving behind everyone's worst nightmare: a white cast.\n\nAlthough spring is just around the corner, your cuticles might still need a little TLC after the last couple of chilly (and drying) months. Consider picking up this conditioning serum that works to strengthen and repair weak and damaged nails. It comes with a slim applicator that allows you to massage the product into the skin without creating a mess, plus the brand promises a non-greasy finish. Post loves to use this when her nails are recovering from a gel or acrylic manicure, adding that it adds moisture when she needs it most.\n\nHow many batteries do you think you've used in your lifetime? Think about everything in your home that needs them: remotes, toys, flashlights, even toothbrushes! They're a household staple, and realizing you're running out of them (especially at a time when you need them most) has to be one of the most frustrating experiences. So, a battery charger set like this one just makes sense, doesn't it? It comes in several battery sizes, all of which are rechargeable and have color indicators to show their current power levels. Its the perfect buy to help you save money and cut down on waste of disposable options.\n\nThis might be the easiest-to-use drain cleaner we've ever seen. Seriously, this simple solution is as easy as dropping a stick into your sink or tub drain, toilet tank or garbage disposal. The cleaner is safe for using on pipes and septic tanks (per the brand) and releases an enzyme-enhanced formula that declogs and eliminates odors. The directions recommend using them once a month \u2014 and with a price of $11.98 for a 12-month supply, that' s less than $1 a month to keep drains moving and smelling fresh. Post says it\u2019ll be your favorite chore because it\u2019s the easiest!\n\nAs someone who is always in need of countertop space, Post says this portable tool is a must for creating extended real estate. The clever cover unfolds right above your sink, offering more room for your makeup essentials, hair tools or whatever else you include in your morning or night routines. According to the brand, it hold up to seven pounds and is heat-safe up to 480 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 so no more balancing your straightener on the ledge just for it to fall and burn your toes. Post says its a great travel tool since it folds flat and is great for placing over hotel sinks.\n\nProducer Isy Tocci using the Sink Topper Foldable Sink Cover. Courtesy of Isy Tocci\n\nMore Amazon bestsellers to shop\n\nPutting together a travel outfit is an important decision. During an hours-long flight, roadtrip or whatever transportation your trip requires, you want to be as comfortable as possible. (We will never understand the pro-jeans or heels travelers.) This palazzo pant is a great choice, with its cozy linen fabric, breathable wide-leg design and ultra-thick and adjustable waistband.\n\nFor a full linen moment, add this chic button-down top to create the ultimate spring look. It comes in a range of colors and exciting patterns, all featuring the same crinkle texture and relaxed fit.\n\nFinding your \"perfect\" lip or cheek tint takes a ton of trial and error \u2014 there are just so many shades to try! But what if we found one-and-done product that's formulated to find your ideal color? This pH-activated stain adjusts to your own chemistry to create the perfect shade for your skin tone. All you need is a small amount that you can blend with your fingertips for a flush of long-lasting, natural-looking tint.\n\nThe thing about stains \u2014 they're unpredictable. An accidental spill at the wrong time can result in ruined clothing, which is why you should have this spot cleaner in your bag at all times. It uses an all-natural formula to instantly absorb, lift and erase marks caused by oil, grease and dairy-based items. Plus, it works on most materials, with cashmere, wool and other animal fibers being the only exceptions.\n\nThese mixing bowls are raising the bar when it comes to kitchen staples. It all comes down to their innovative silicone lids, which are not only airtight to keep food fresh, but are also designed with an opening to fit three types of graters, so you can grate foods directly into the bowl.\n\nContributing writer Colleen Sullivan was on the hunt for flats that didn't hurt her feet and found her match with this Amazon Essentials pair. \"I find myself reaching for these shoes when I have a casual work event, need a cute shoe to wear out for a meal or if I want to slip on something easy and comfy while driving,\" she says. \"I recommend these for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable alternative to their everyday shoe.\"\n\nWe can always count on Tree Hut to amp up our shower routines. The brand's sugar scrubs are a Shop TODAY shopper favorite, most especially for their unique scents and hydrating formula.\n\nCommerce writer Emma Stessman tried some of the top shoe deodorizers on the market and ranked NonScents as the best multi-purpose product. She said they \"completely eliminated any trace of odor\" in her running shoes and were extremely easy to use.\n\nYou don't want to sleep on the benefits of a stone bath mat. This one is designed with 00% diatomaceous earth, making it super absorbent and more long-lasting than your typical mat.\n\nA glam watch is the perfect way to elevate your bracelet stack. Luckily for you, it doesn't have to be an expensive addition. We found this crystal-encrusted and gold-toned accessory (it also comes in several other metals and face colors) for 52% off on Amazon.\n\nHow we chose\n\nThe Shop TODAY editors and writers search the internet to find the best products out there.

Amazon is down nearly 20% from its all-time high, and is actually near the cheapest the stock has ever been based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The tech giant's valuation on that key metric hasn't been this low in two decades. This is a big deal, and investors should consider scooping up shares right now, as this could be a golden opportunity to cash in on a stock that's rarely discounted.\n\nAmazon has two major business units pushing its profits higher\n\nAmazon's e-commerce platform is the part of the company that most consumers interact with. However, there's a lot more to Amazon, and its other units offer far more compelling reasons to invest. In Q4, Amazon's online stores unit grew sales by 7% to $75.6 billion, so it's the largest part of the business by revenue, but also the slowest-growing one. Furthermore, e-commerce has notoriously low margins, so it's safe to assume that Amazon isn't generating a ton of profit from those sales.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nTwo other units account for the lion's share of Amazon's profits: advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company groups advertising into its commerce division categories when it reports profits, so investors can't see the exact margins this unit is putting up. However, by looking at other companies focused on digital advertising versus those focusing on retail, it's safe to assume that this is an incredibly profitable business for Amazon. In Q4, its advertising revenue rose 18% year over year to $17.3 billion. While that's 23% of the revenue of Amazon's online stores, if we assume that the online stores segment had about the same operating profit margin as Walmart (4.3%) and that the digital advertising segment had a margin comparable to that of Alphabet (32%), then we'd conclude that online stores segment would have generated about $3.25 billion in operating profits while advertising generated about $5.54 billion.\n\nTrue, those are assumptions based on the margins of similar businesses (because Amazon doesn't publicize the operating margins of all of its business units), but they illustrate how important digital advertising is to Amazon.\n\nThe company, does, however, break out its operating margins for AWS, and they are much higher than the margins of its commerce-focused segments.\n\nIn Q4, the cloud computing segment had an operating margin of 37%. This far exceeds Amazon's companywide operating margin of 11.3%. Moreover, for the full year, AWS provided 58% of Amazon's operating profits, so from a bottom-line perspective, it's the company's most important business unit.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that even if the U.S. enters an economic downturn, the part of Amazon's business that is its biggest profit driver will not be as heavily affected as its more consumer-focused units. In that light, they may find it easier to justify buying the stock today.\n\nAmazon has never been this cheap before\n\nAmazon's stock now trades at 35.5 times trailing earnings; it has seldom been this cheap.\n\nIndeed, the last time Amazon's valuation was this low was in the mid-2000s, when its business looked far different from what it looks like today. As a result, I think this share price slide presents a great buying opportunity, as in the longer term, AWS and digital advertising are likely to push Amazon's earnings -- and the stock price -- much higher.\n\nAnalyst Nat Schindler at Scotiabank gave similar reasons to support the $306 12-month price target he put on Amazon's stock in January. That would amount to a rise of more than 50% from the current price -- a massive potential gain.\n\nWhile I don't know if Amazon's stock will grow that much this year, I think Schindler generally has the right idea here. As a result, I think right now would be an excellent time to buy Amazon stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "David Tepper is the founder and president of Appaloosa Management, one of the 15 most successful hedge funds in history as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Tepper sold 600,000 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), trimming his position by 19%. He also purchased 1.4 million shares of Vistra (NYSE: VST), more than doubling his stake. Vistra is a power-generation company that could benefit if artificial intelligence boosts data center electricity demand.\n\nImportantly, shares of Amazon and Vistra have declined about 10% since the fourth quarter ended, but Wall Street expects both stocks to rebound sharply in the coming months, as detailed below:\n\nAmazon has a median target price of $270 per share, which implies 36% upside from its current share price of $198.\n\nVistra's median target price is $192 per share, implying 55% upside from its current share price of $124.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and public cloud services. And it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve revenue and operating efficiency across all three segments. In particular, Amazon is an underappreciated AI leader in retail and cloud computing, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nFor example, Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in the world outside of China, and it supports its merchants with a vast logistics network. To reinforce its strong market presence, the company uses machine learning models to recommend products, optimize inventory allocation, and plan delivery routes. Those efforts have already led to an uptick in margins.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud in terms of sales and the most popular cloud among developers. That alone positions the company as a winner in the AI boom. But the company is also innovating quickly. CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and generative AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined.\"\n\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter, despite missing sales estimates in the adtech segment. Revenue increased 10% to $187 billion, operating margin expanded more than 3 percentage points, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings rose 86% to $1.00 per diluted share. Management also said cloud revenue could have grown faster had AWS not been capacity-constrained.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to grow at 21% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look quite reasonable. So, why did Tepper sell Amazon in the fourth quarter? I suspect he was rebalancing his portfolio, but I doubt he has lost conviction in the stock. Amazon was still his second-largest holding when the quarter ended.",

            "content": "Amazon offers some great deals year-round, but some periods offer better bargains. Major shopping events like Prime Day and Cyber Monday bring some of the year's lowest prices, and in 2024, Amazon added a new event to its calendar. The Big Spring Sale took place last March, and though the company hasn't said anything about this year's sale, we'll likely see another round of deals in the coming days or weeks. Here's what we know so far.\n\nAmazon has a track record of expanding its sale event offerings beyond the traditional summer Prime Day and fall Black Friday periods. In 2020, Amazon was forced to move its Prime Day sale to October because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though in subsequent years, the company has used the October timeframe to launch an additional Prime Day-like sale. If Amazon saw success using a spring slot for a sale event in 2024, it wouldn't be surprising to see such a sale occur again in 2025. There aren't any confirmed details yet, but you'll find our predictions of what you could expect, along with some excellent deals already available, below.\n\nWhen will the sale take place?\n\nAmazon hasn't confirmed a Big Spring Sale for this year, so there aren't any set dates. But given that last year's Big Spring Sale ran from March 20 to March 25, we'd expect it to take place sometime around the last week of March this year, especially since we're over halfway through the month at this point.\n\nWhat kind of deals will be available?\n\nAmazon sells just about everything, from TVs to home goods, and we'd expect to see deals across every category. This would likely include some of the year's lowest prices on top tech, like headphones and tablets. Plus, based on the timing, there will likely be some more-seasonal offers, on things like grills, camping equipment, patio furniture, backyard games and other warm-weather goodies.\n\nWill I need a Prime membership to shop the sale?\n\nJudging from Amazon's past events, you won't need to be a Prime member to shop deals at the Big Spring Sale. However, Prime members often get special benefits, like extra discounts or exclusive access to certain deals. If you want to take full advantage of the savings, it may be worth signing up if and when the sale is announced.\n\nWill other retailers have a spring sale?\n\nWe haven't heard any rumors about competitors like Best Buy, Target or Walmart offering their own official spring sale. However, the best deals are typically price-matched across major retailers, and we'd expect that many of the bargains offered by Amazon will be available at a handful of other places.\n\nShould I wait for Prime Day?\n\nPrime Day is one of Amazon's biggest shopping events, and the first Prime Day of the year typically takes place in July (with a second one kicking off the holiday shopping season in October). We're sure to see some excellent deals this summer, but outside of a small handful of once-a-year offers, you'll likely find similar savings available during the spring sale.\n\nAre there any early deals available?\n\nThe sale hasn't been confirmed yet, so there aren't any \"official\" early deals. However, Amazon always offers a rotating selection of amazing bargains, and we've rounded up some of the very best ones to shop right now, below. We'll continue to update this page as more deals roll in, so be sure to check back often.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nBe sure to visit this page throughout the month, because we'll keep updating it with the latest info. And, of course, stick with us as your savings resource, because we'll be covering all the best bargains on Amazon throughout the year.",

            "content": "At first glance this very affordable house looks cool, but you'll have to put up with a huge inconvenience\n\nSellers on Amazon are offering prefab tiny homes for sale, including some with garages.\n\nIn many cases, they cost less than a brand new car, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a good deal.\n\nOne recently highlighted online does have a garage but is missing a very important feature.\n\nThe housing crisis has people across the USA scrambling for solutions. It\u2019s part of why several sellers on Amazon are now offering prefabricated tiny homes that can fit just about anywhere. Of course, sometimes things that appear to be too good to be true are in fact just so.\n\nTake, for example, this quaint little home with two bedrooms, a large living room, and even a garage space for your BMW sedan. Priced at just $13,678, it sounds like a steal. In fact, the description of it paints a beautiful picture for prospective buyers.\n\nMore: Bugatti\u2019s New Garage Is The Ultimate Toy Box For Your Million-Dollar Hypercar\n\n\u201cThe spacious interior features living, dining, kitchen, and bedroom areas, providing ample space for your lifestyle needs. Constructed with durable shipping containers, this modular home boasts a sleek and contemporary design. Enjoy the convenience of easy assembly and the flexibility to relocate if desired. With its garage and outdoor deck, this container house combines functionality with style.\u201d\n\nIn essence, buyers could use this home and then move it should they find another property where they\u2019d prefer it. Maybe that\u2019s why Southern Living featured it in November of last year. Of course, they might have missed a few noteworthy bits that we\u2019d like to point out. For one thing, note that the word \u201cbathroom\u201d never came up anywhere until now. Not in the product description and not in the floor plan either. Don\u2019t take it from us either. Here\u2019s a top-down view of the bedrooms.\n\nThe lower floor does feature a sink so there is some plumbing here but that appears to be the extent of it. Luxury living in my mind always involves having a bathroom available on property. The good folks at Southern Living might call me soft but that\u2019s my stance. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s rendered in the middle of a cornfield with irrigation. The field IS the bathroom.\n\nMore: VW\u2019s Biggest Motorhome Is A Tiny House On Wheels\n\nOn top of that questionable omission, it seems that the seller, only listed as \u201cGeneric\u201d now on Amazon, isn\u2019t replying to prospective buyers either. Tiny homes are indeed available on the platform but perhaps it\u2019s best that this is no longer one of them. Sure, a home and garage for less than the price of your car sounds great. But in this case it\u2019s certainly too good to be true.",

Here's how to get more out of them. Problem Solved\n\nSmart speakers can be a useful companion in your home. The voice-controlled devices can answer random questions, set multiple timers as you cook and play your favorite podcasts. Some even have generative artificial intelligence built in to take its abilities even further.\n\nWhile those features are useful, there are some things your Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices can do that you might not even think to ask. It's worth noting Alexa users may need to enable the skill on the device beforehand.\n\nHowever you choose to use your devices, it\u2019s always a good idea to review their privacy settings and check that your information is handled in a way you're comfortable with.\n\nWatch this video for four unexpected ways you can use your smart speaker.\n\nFind my phone\n\nIf you can't find where you placed your phone, ask Google!\n\n\u201cHey Google, find my phone\u201d will cause your device to chime for about 30 seconds. If you have multiple devices linked, you will need to specify which device you want it to locate.\n\nThis feature works with iPhones, Androids, tablets and some accessories, like Pixel Buds, but they do need to be linked to your account for the speaker to locate it.\n\nHow to play the radio on your smart speaker\n\nThe influx of technology has also provided us with many different ways to consume audio throughout our day. If you enjoy tuning into terrestrial radio, you can play your favorite station on your smart speaker. It can tune into AM and FM stations in your area and across the country, just ask your speaker to play using the station\u2019s name, frequency or call letters.\n\nShop top-rated related products:\n\nPurchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nHow to use Alexa, Google Home as an intercom\n\nIf you need to relay a message to someone in your home but they\u2019re not within earshot, ask your speaker to help deliver the memo. Amazon Alexa and Google Home devices can act as an intercom when you have multiple devices set up in your home.\n\nYou can say, \u201cHey Google, announce it\u2019s time to go\u201d or \u201cAlexa, drop in on living room.\u201d The Google speaker will make an announcement, while the Alexa device will allow you to speak directly through the speaker.\n\nUse your smart speaker to help you sleep\n\nIf you or your kids prefer to drift off to sleep accompanied by the sounds of rain, waves or white noise, ask your speaker to play you off.

One driver has been arrested in connection with the fatal crash that halted traffic for more than 13 hours. Here\u2019s everything we know about the crash that has rattled the Texas capital for over 24 hours.\n\nDetails on how the deadly I-35 crash happened\n\nDetails remain somewhat vague on exactly what caused the 17-care pileup on I-35 in North Austin near Parmer Lane. The wreck occurred shortly before 11:30 p.m. Thursday night, March 13, but the impacts will be felt for long after.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nA witness on the scene claimed an 18-wheeler slammed into traffic halted on I-35 that night, though official reports from police have been unclear of if this is accurate. However, a video shared online, dispersed by several local media outlets, shows an 18-wheeler crashed out on the interstate that night with several vehicles bashed in its wake.\n\nAt least 5 dead, 11 injured in 17-car pileup\n\nAustin-Travis County EMS officials confirmed five victims in the crash were killed, including an infant. Another 11 were reported injured and transported to local hospitals, including another child with life-threatening injuries who was taken to Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nTwo adults with life-threatening injuries were taken to St. David\u2019s Round Rock Medical Center. Three more adults, two of which were also in critical condition, were transported to Dell Seton Medical Center at the University of Texas. Two more children with minor injuries were also sent to Dell Children\u2019s.\n\nIn total, there were 17 patients in the 17-vehicle crash, but one patient reportedly refused medical attention.\n\nSolomun Weldekeal Araya arrested in relation to I-35 crash\n\nOn Friday afternoon, March 14, the Austin Police Department confirmed it arrested Solomun Weldekeal Araya, 37, in relation to the fatal crash. He was charged with five counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIntoxication manslaughter is a second-degree felony in Texas which, upon conviction, carries a prison sentence of two to 20 years. Intoxication assault is a third-degree felony with a punishment range of two to 10 years in state prison. Araya remains in the Travis County Jail.\n\nAraya's name also appeared on a court docket for the City of Wilmer, southeast of Dallas, for a speeding ticket. He was scheduled to appear in court at 8:30 a.m. on March 19.\n\nI-35 in North Austin closed for 13 hours after fatal crash\n\nThe 12900 block of I-35's southbound lanes in North Austin were shut down for a big chuck of the day Friday as first responders worked the scene, investigating the crash, treating those injured and clearing debris. The crash initially occurred shortly before 11:30 p.m. Thursday but officials did not fully open up all main lanes until 1 p.m. Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAmazon responds to fatal I-35 crash, confirm Amazon hauler involved\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Amber Plunkett, confirmed Friday afternoon that a truck hauling for the massive online retailer was one of the 17 vehicles involved. Plunkett did not confirm if Araya was driving the truck or if the Amazon-contracted truck caused the crash.\n\n\"This is a horrible tragedy, and our thoughts are with all those involved,\" Plunkett said to MySA. \"We're looking into this further and will cooperate with law enforcement as they investigate.\"\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigating crash\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing investigation into what and who caused the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board announced it would be working alongside Austin PD to analyze the crash and cause. NTSB investigates every civil aviation accident on U.S. soil, but the agency also gets involved during \"significant\" accidents involving vehicles, trains or other modes of transportation.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

            "content": "Mark your calendar for earnings reports. For Amazon it\u2019s April 29. For Walmart it\u2019s May 15.\n\nIf you have any stake or interest in the fortunes of the American consumer, those dates will be ones to watch, because as the first quarter draws to a close, Amazon and Walmart are bracing for what could be a challenging earnings season.\n\nBoth companies, bellwethers of consumer spending, have expressed caution about their Q1 prospects due to persistent inflation, weak consumer demand and foreign exchange challenges. This cautious outlook reflects broader concerns about the health of the global economy and its impact on consumer behavior.\n\nThey are, of course, not alone in the attention those earnings will receive. Other companies will step up with their own take on consumer spending, but it is expected to be down, maybe even significantly.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, \u201cCiti\u2019s analysis of its U.S. credit-card data shows that spending has fallen across most retail categories. In the retail quarter to date, spending plunged 12% and 22% on apparel and athletic footwear, respectively, compared with a year earlier. But even less-discretionary categories such as food retail, aftermarket auto parts and pet retail are seeing moderate declines.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, consumers have been prioritizing essential purchases over discretionary items, a trend exacerbated by high inflation. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted this shift during a March 10 speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, stating, \u201cThere are lots of income levels in this country \u2014 if you\u2019re at the lower end of that scale, you are feeling more frustration and pain because of higher food prices. They\u2019ve persisted for years now, and you\u2019re just tired of it.\u201d\n\nMcMillon also highlighted that budget-conscious consumers are buying smaller pack sizes and being more selective with their purchases. But there are other issues. According to a March 7 article from Zachs, \u201cWalmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view [Q1 by the calendar] for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Amazon has faced challenges in maintaining its sales momentum. The company\u2019s projected revenue for Q1 2025 was below expectations, ranging from $151 billion to $155.5 billion, reflecting concerns about inflation and consumer spending.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, observed, \u201cUncertainty seems to be the buzzword of earnings calls. \u2026 Going into this year, a lot of retailers are very nervous about various aspects of policy, particularly tariffs. They fear both the cost implications for their businesses and the dampening impact higher prices would have on spending.\u201d\n\nImpact of Tariffs and Inflation\n\nTariffs have been another significant factor affecting both retailers. Walmart, as the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, is particularly vulnerable to tariffs on discretionary items like clothing and electronics, which are primarily sourced from countries such as China and India.\n\nBrian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, noted that more than 70% of Walmart\u2019s Great Value brand products come from China, making the company sensitive to tariff fluctuations.\n\nInflation continues to pressure consumer budgets, leading to a focus on value-driven purchases. Jeanel Alvarado, founder and CEO of RetailBoss, explained, \u201cConsumers feel the pinch of inflation, shifting their focus to essentials like groceries and health products while cutting back on discretionary items like apparel and electronics.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, both companies have shown resilience. Amazon recently surpassed Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time, with $187.8 billion in sales compared to Walmart\u2019s $180.5 billion. However, Walmart\u2019s annual sales still outpace Amazon\u2019s, with projections indicating Walmart will generate approximately $708.7 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, while Amazon is expected to reach about $700.8 billion.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock has faced volatility following its mixed Q4 earnings report, with shares dropping after the company provided softer-than-expected guidance for Q1 2025 and beyond. Despite this, Walmart\u2019s business fundamentals remain strong, with eCommerce sales surging and the company attracting higher-income shoppers.\n\nAs Amazon and Walmart prepare to report their Q1 2025 earnings, the retail landscape is marked by caution. Consumer spending trends suggest a continued focus on essentials and value-driven purchases, influenced by inflation and tariff concerns.\n\nWhile both companies face challenges, their adaptability and strategic shifts in response to consumer behavior will be crucial in navigating these headwinds. As Saunders noted, \u201cThere is genuine concern that demand could soften in a material way,\u201d underscoring the need for retailers to remain agile in an uncertain economic environment.",

According to several reviews, the assistant often makes mistakes, doesn\u2019t recommend products shoppers are asking for and sometimes doesn\u2019t suggest products at all.\n\nOne review in the Washington Post noted that Rufus made poor recommendations for cycling gloves and didn\u2019t recommend any products when asked for help with composting at home.\n\nAnother reviewer from Marketplace Pulse also reviewed the new assistant.\n\n\u201cIf asked for the best marathon running shoes, it will respond with options no runner or coach would recommend,\u201d the writer stated. \u201cIf asked for winter gloves, it will respond with a list seemingly picked at random.\u201d\n\nOf course, we should keep in mind that Rufus is relatively new, and likely to improve. Marketplace Pulse points out that all AI systems \u201csuffer hallucinations,\u201d especially early on. The problem with Rufus is that the mistakes are glaringly obvious and the assistant is featured prominently on Amazon\u2019s app as a button.\n\nMost experts predict Rufus will get smarter. For now, the Washington Post reviewer said the chatbot is \u201cnot a disaster, but also mostly useless.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

            "content": "For FuoriSalone 2025, as part of the INTERNI Cre-Action exhibition-event, Amazon presents \u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019, an installation designed by the international architecture firm MAD, which includes a curated selection of furniture and home design products available on Amazon.it. The installation will be hosted in the Pharmacy Courtyard (Cortile della Farmacia) of the University of Milan.\n\n\u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019 is a modern take on the Italian piazza (square), which historically served as the beating heart of social and commercial life. As with traditional piazzas, the installation\u2019s focal point is a pavilion. The installation is divided into three distinct thematic areas, presenting a wide selection of products for the home, furnishings, lighting, smart home and technological accessories, from popular to the most niche, with a specific focus on products made by small and medium-sized Italian companies.\n\nThe space features a soundscape curated by Conservatorio Giuseppe Verdi of Milan and the University of Milan\u2019s Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale, together with an augmented reality experience developed by StudioAira. The roof, made of coloured ETFE strips, amplifies the space, lighting and the overall experience, while the central mirrored pavilion, conceived as a space for contemplation, displays design objects for visitors to view.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be back at FuoriSalone as part of the INTERNI Cre-Action exhibition-event with \u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019, this creative vision has transformed the space into an immersive and engaging experience for visitors,\u201d says Marco Ferrara, Director EU Furniture at Amazon. \u201cThis year, our presence at the Pharmacy Courtyard of the University of Milan aims not only to celebrate design in all its forms, but also to allow customers to explore the home furnishings and design products available on Amazon.it, in addition to the innovations that are revolutionising the shopping experience for our customers. Once again, we want to place particular emphasis on the excellence of Italian products, an invaluable source of creativity that has allowed Italian design to stand out across the world, confirming our commitment to fully showcasing that combination of tradition and innovation that makes Italian design unique.\"\n\nFor MAD, \u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019 represents an architectural experience comprising discovery and reflection. The installation is spread across several levels, involving visitors through the lighting elements created by Artemide, which interpret light as an element of interaction between the environment and the individual. The surrounding areas reflect the central pavilion\u2019s style, offering new perspectives and transforming a familiar experience into something unexpected.\n\n\u201cAt MAD we often play with reality and how it is perceived,\u201d says Andrea D'Antrassi, Associate Partner at MAD. \u201cWith \u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019 we wanted to offer a new vision of the piazza, interpreting it as a space for connections and encounters. We can think of it as a familiar environment, but certainly the peculiarity of the installation does not lie so much in the iconic elements that make the piazza a well-known place, but rather in the possibility that it refers to something else, something different and new.\n\nTo further enrich the \u2018Amazing Plaza\u2019 experience, the Pharmacy Courtyard will also play host to \u2018The Amazing Talks\u2019, a series of conversations with prominent figures from the world of design and architecture, who will share their visions, experiences and perspectives on current and future trends in the sector.\n\n\u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019 will also come to life through \u2018Plaza in Sound\u2019, an unmissable series of musical performances created in collaboration with Filarmonica della Scala, sponsored by Lurisia Premium Beverages. The result will be a fascinating interweaving of live instrumental and electronic music, which will envelop and transform the installation space, amplifying its immersive nature.\n\nAmazon\u2019s technological innovation is reflected in the experience offered to visitors of the installation: by scanning the QR codes positioned next to the products on display, they will be able to access the relevant product pages on Amazon.it, while a series of screens integrated into the exhibition area will illustrate the latest innovations in product research, selection and shipping. Visitors will also be able to discover advanced features such as augmented reality visualisation, allowing them to see how products would look in their home before purchasing. A 360\u00b0 view of the products and the \u2018Discover\u2019 feature allow for product search according to style preferences, and provides personalised suggestions. Particular attention is paid to the shopping experience for large appliances, furniture and furnishings, with Amazon giving customers the option to select the date and time range for delivery, as well as complementary services such as unpacking, installation and collection of used goods, available subject to product type and delivery area.\n\n\u2018The Amazing Plaza\u2019 gives visitors a small taste of the wide range of products available in the home and design categories on Amazon.it. The selection encompasses everything from big brands to niche companies, including Amazon brands and creations by small and medium-sized Italian businesses. It also includes smart home solutions, such as intelligent lighting systems and Echo devices with Alexa integration. Among the offerings are some of the over 1.4 million products worldwide to have obtained at least one of the sustainability certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly programme, as well as a careful selection of returned items available on the Amazon Second Chance storefront, giving them a new life. In addition, Amazon reinforces its support for Italian excellence with \u2018Design Made in Italy\u2019, the category available within the Made in Italy storefront dedicated exclusively to Italian design.\n\nThe \u2018Amazing Plaza\u2019 event is organized in collaboration with numerous partners: Groupe Seb Italia, with the brands Moulinex, Rowenta and Lagostina (as main partners), Lurisia Premium Beverages, Signify, Sodastream, Ariete, Polti, Fastweb, Twinkly, Zafferano, Bialetti, LEGO, Electrolux, Blomus, Ichendorf, MEUBLE COSY, StudioAira, Maco Technology SRL and Piante Faro. Technical partners: Motorola and Samsung TV. Lighting partner: Artemide.\n\nFor more information about \u2018The Amazing Talks\u2019 and the \u2018Plaza in Sound\u2019 including a full schedule of events, click here.",

He\u2019s a character that I really adore. He\u2019s a ton of fun to write, and he wasn\u2019t in the comic very much. If a character becomes popular at Marvel or DC, they bring them back over and over and over again until they are less popular. By trying to make Invincible something that celebrates traditional superhero storytelling but also tries to play against type, no matter how popular Conquest got, we\u2019ve told his story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you get,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot left on the table that I would love to get to at some point.

            "content": "In a bold stride towards digital transformation, NASCAR has announced its partnership with Amazon Prime Video, setting the pace for an exciting and innovative era in sports broadcasting. Five major races will be exclusively streamed on the platform in 2025, a move that has left traditional viewers and sponsors in suspense. Will this shift to a digital-first approach be as successful as NASCAR President Steve Phelps predicts?\n\nPhelps, a visionary leader in the sports industry, is optimistic about this digital evolution and anticipates that Prime Video viewership will match, if not surpass, the numbers seen on FOX\u2019s cable. Phelps\u2019 confidence isn\u2019t unfounded. The trend towards digital platforms has been embraced by other leagues including the NFL and MLS, resulting in an expanded reach and attraction of a younger audience.\n\nThis ambitious venture into streaming is expected to retain NASCAR\u2019s core fan base while also attracting new, tech-savvy viewers. However, the real test will be whether this digital leap will deliver the desired results or leave fans nostalgic for traditional broadcasts.\n\nNASCAR\u2019s leadership is putting all its confidence in digital platforms, with Prime Video scheduled to air its first race in late May. Phelps anticipates that the viewership could match, if not exceed, cable numbers, potentially drawing at least 2 million viewers. This is encouraging news for sponsors and stakeholders who have been apprehensive about the transition from traditional TV.\n\nTo help fans adjust to the new format, Prime has started airing selected NASCAR practice and qualifying sessions. While FOX still holds the rights to early-season practice and qualifying for key events such as the Daytona 500 and All-Star Race, Amazon will manage these sessions for most other events. This phased approach, NASCAR executives believe, will help fans gradually adapt to the new format.\n\nNASCAR\u2019s confidence is also boosted by Amazon\u2019s vast subscriber base. Although Prime Video has been tight-lipped about its early NASCAR viewership data, NASCAR executives believe that a significant portion of its fan base are already Prime subscribers. The sport\u2019s strong brand loyalty, paired with the vast Amazon audience, is expected to drive engagement.\n\nThe transition to Prime Video is more than just a new broadcasting platform for NASCAR, it\u2019s a strategic partnership. Phelps sees Amazon as a long-term ally, highlighting that streaming is a permanent fixture in the modern world. The shift to Prime Video is also hoped to draw in younger audiences, with Phelps confident that Amazon will bring a fresh approach to the sport.\n\nNASCAR is also taking steps to ensure transparency in measuring its streaming success. Brian Herbst, the sport\u2019s executive vice president of media and revenue, confirmed that NASCAR\u2019s races on Prime will be Nielsen-rated, offering transparency for sponsors and advertisers.\n\nThe move into digital streaming is not just a domestic shift, but an international one. NASCAR\u2019s inclusion of a race in Mexico City as part of Prime Video\u2019s exclusive package demonstrates the sport\u2019s global ambitions. The international expansion offers sponsors a chance to reach a more diverse audience and extend their brand influence beyond NASCAR\u2019s traditional U.S. base.\n\nDespite potential challenges including the need for an active Prime Video subscription and the possible resistance from NASCAR\u2019s older demographic, NASCAR executives believe the accessibility and flexibility of streaming will outweigh these concerns.\n\nBeyond viewership numbers and sponsorship benefits, Prime Video is bringing a new perspective to NASCAR broadcasting. They have assembled a stellar commentary team including Adam Alexander, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Steve Letarte, and the surprise addition of Carl Edwards, a Hall of Fame driver who has been largely absent from the sport since his retirement in 2017.\n\nAmazon is also leveraging its streaming advantages to enhance race-day coverage. Unlike traditional TV networks that have to cut broadcasts short, Prime Video can extend post-race shows without time constraints. This opens new promotional opportunities for NASCAR, with potential plans for branding NASCAR content on Amazon delivery trucks and packaging.\n\nThis shift to streaming is a calculated move to future-proof NASCAR. By partnering with Prime Video, NASCAR is not only maintaining visibility but also positioning itself for long-term audience growth. The success of this digital transformation is yet to be seen, but with strategic planning, strong marketing potential, and high production value, NASCAR is certainly on the fast track to a digital-first future.",

            "content": "Buying shares of Tesla, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), and Amazon at the beginning of 2015 would have been one of the greatest decisions any investor could have ever made. A $10,000 investment in each of these companies would now be worth over $150,000, $147,000, and $124,000, respectively. In other words, this simple three-stock portfolio would have gone from $30,000 to over $420,000 in just a little over 10 years.\n\nHowever, there was a one-stock portfolio that outperformed this three-stock portfolio during this time. If you invested $10,000 in shares of Casella Waste Systems (NASDAQ: CWST), you'd have $269,000 today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nNot only is Casella stock up nearly 2,600% in the last 10 years, it's also up 123% over the past five years and up 16% in the past year. This little-known stock just continues to crush the market.\n\nAnd to be clear, Casella is a little-known stock. Just consider how it's covered professionally. There are dozens of prominent analysts providing regular commentary for top stocks such as Tesla, Strategy, and Amazon. But among the analysts tracked by TipRanks, only five have recently weighed in on Casella.\n\nGiven its track record of crushing the market and its ongoing ability to fly under the radar, Casella Waste Systems is a company that I couldn't resist digging deeper.\n\nHow Casella Waste Systems makes money\n\nFor investors familiar with WM (formerly known as Waste Management), Casella is a straightforward business. It provides residential and commercial garbage services, picking it up, transferring it to landfills, recycling it, and more. The company operates in 10 adjacent states, five of which are in the New England region.\n\nIn 2024, Casella generated revenue of $962 million by collecting trash, which was up 35% year over year. This segment accounted for 62% of its total revenue, which makes this the biggest part of the business. But take this growth rate with a grain of salt, because the company made eight acquisitions in 2024.\n\nIndeed, mergers and acquisitions are a main component of Casella's growth strategy. After all, this kind of business has a limited customer base in established markets. It can also only grow so much by raising prices. And every market in the country already has a trash solution.\n\nHowever, trash collection is an excellent business because it's largely recession-resilient -- communities continue to create garbage regardless of economic conditions. Moreover, this business is usually resistant to competition within the areas that it operates.\n\nCompanies that own landfills also have a competitive moat because it's a regulated space, and new sites are hard to come by. WM owns 262 landfill sites as of the end of 2024, making it the largest player in the country.\n\nFor its part, Casella only has eight landfills -- significantly smaller. But there are relatively few landfills in the company's territory, with much of the trash needing to be shipped out of state. It makes the eight landfills that it does have quite valuable. And it means that Casella is able to regularly raise prices.\n\nIs Casella Waste Systems stock a buy?\n\nFor the sake of brevity, I believe that Casella Waste Systems stock could be a good investment if it continues to grow, profits improve, and shares can be purchased at an attractive valuation. I'll consider each point in turn.\n\nCasella's existing revenue stream is predictable, since it signs long-term contracts in its service areas. It can achieve low-single-digit growth with ongoing price increases. But the greatest growth potential would come from acquisitions.\n\nOver the past three years, Casella has acquired 29 companies for $1.4 billion. While it's usually a good idea to be skeptical of the growth-by-acquisition strategy, it can be a good idea here. For starters, these businesses tend to sell for far more reasonable prices than flashier tech stocks. Moreover, by acquiring similar businesses in adjacent regions, Casella can get more efficient and improve profitability.\n\nI would expect more acquisitions from Casella in 2025 and beyond. And it could be a good thing if profits improve as well. Moreover, the company does have other margin-accretive works in progress, such as upgrading facilities.\n\nTherefore, Casella can grow its top and bottom line long term, even if gains are modest. To the third consideration, the stock is trading at a slightly higher-than-normal valuation, as the chart shows.\n\nBeing a slower-growth company, I believe that investors should be mindful about the valuation of Casella stock. I would think that roughly a 15% pullback would bring shares to more attractive levels.\n\nThis could actually be good news for investors today. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is suddenly approaching correction territory. During times of market panic, incredibly stable, reliable businesses such as Casella often go on sale. This stock has pulled back 20% in previous market corrections, and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened again.\n\nCasella Waste Systems stock has an incredible track record of market-crushing returns. These are the kinds of companies that can be especially good buys when they go on sale. And a sale could be right around the corner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Casella Waste Systems right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Casella Waste Systems, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Casella Waste Systems wasn\u2019t one of them.

Photo by John Angelillo/UPI | License Photo\n\nMarch 13 (UPI) -- The Federal Trade Commission said it was ready to litigate its case against Amazon for alleged deceptive practices, despite an earlier request in the day for more time. FTC's legal team had at first on Wednesday asked U.S. District Court Judge John Chun for the Western District of Washington for a two-month continuance regarding the case due to staffing and financial deficits, and Judge Chun then set a Sept. 22 trial date. FTC lawyer Jonathan Cohen claimed that the FTC had \"lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team.\" Advertisement\n\nWhen the judge asked Cohen how things could improve by then if the commission was \"in crisis now, as far as resources,\" Cohen said the FTC may have to move to another office, which could impair its ability to properly prepare for the trial.\n\nHowever, hours later Wednesday, Amazon attorney John Hueston contested Cohen's delay request, saying the FTC can meet its deadlines necessary to begin the case.\n\n\"There has been no showing on this call that the government does not have the resources to proceed to trial with the trial date as presently set,\" Hueston said, adding that the trial team was properly staffed and ready to go, even if there was an office move in the works, \"And by the way, both in government and private sector, I've never heard of an office move being more than a few days disruptive.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCohen then wrote a letter to Judge Chun stating he \"was wrong\" and that the FTC \"does not have resource constraints\" and was \"fully prepared to litigate this case.\"\n\n\"Please be assured that the FTC will meet whatever schedule and deadlines the court sets,\" he wrote.\n\nAn FTC spokesperson also confirmed to CNBC that the agency is no longer seeking a delayed start date for the trial.\n\nThe FTC had first filed suit against Amazon in June 2023, alleging that it was deceiving millions of customers by having them sign up for its Amazon Prime program, but then \"knowingly complicated the cancellation process for Prime subscribers who sought to end their membership.\"\n\nNow-former former FTC Chair Lina Khan said at the time that \"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" and that \"These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike.\"\n\nAmazon has denied this, purporting in a statement that the \"FTC's focus has radically departed from its mission of protecting consumers and competition, and calling the FTC's claims \"wrong on the facts and the law, and we look forward to making that case in court.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrent FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has since confirmed that Cohen's initial delay request was incorrect, telling CNBC that the \"Trump-Vance FTC will never back down from taking on Big Tech.\"",

We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species.\"\n\n\u2014 Prof. Silvia Sardinha, wildlife vet and researcher\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is critical for regulating global carbon levels and sustaining biodiversity. In a paradox that environmentalists find hard to ignore, new infrastructure projects \u2014 including roads \u2014 are being carved through the forest to accommodate global climate summits.\n\nDeforestation in the Amazon is already a major driver of global carbon emissions, with land cleared primarily for agriculture, logging, and mining. Roads tend to accelerate this process, opening once-remote areas to further degradation. Research shows that up to 95% of deforestation in the Amazon occurs within a few miles of roads, often leading to unchecked expansion of industry, land grabs, and displacement of Indigenous communities.\n\nRelated: Brazilian states push back on Amazon protections",

            "content": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - Amazon Prime Air confirmed it will not be renewing its current building lease in College Station, which is set to expire Sept. 30.\n\nThe building housed the corporation\u2019s drone delivery program, which first took to the skies in December 2022.\n\nDrone flights were completely grounded in mid-January as part of an ongoing software update process. Amazon will not be able to resume drone delivery operations without FAA approval on the software changes.\n\nSince the program launched, many College Station residents have been outspoken about the disturbance they said Prime Air\u2019s drone operations have caused.\n\nIn June, resident Bill Stockton said, \u201cThey sit less than 500 feet from my neighbor\u2019s fence, causing disruptive noise all day every day.\u201d\n\nAt a February 2024 College Station City Council meeting, one resident referred to the sound made by the drones as, \u201cthe noise equivalent of a flying chainsaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my family moved into our current home on Brookwater Circle, it was located in a quiet residential area. Today, because of Amazon Prime Air drone, it is effectively an industrial zone. Every day of the week, from morning till evening, the noise equivalent of a flying chainsaw raises above the tree line of my backyard,\u201d Brad Marquardt said.\n\nHowever, Amazon said Wednesday that just because they\u2019re not renewing their current lease doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re planning to leave College Station entirely.\n\n\u201cCollege Station is a great partner to Prime Air and we\u2019re proud of all the work we\u2019ve done together since launching in 2022. We recently shared with our local partners that we don\u2019t intend to renew our current lease at our facility when it expires later this year. That said, the process of integrating drone delivery into our existing global fulfillment network is ongoing and we look forward to sharing more soon about our future plans.\u201d\n\nCollege Station Mayor John Nichols said it\u2019s unclear exactly what comes next for Amazon.\n\n\u201cI do not know whether they have another location identified. They have not informed us of that, but they did inform us that they were looking for another location,\u201d he said.\n\nNichols added that Prime Air has looked at other real estate in the area, but has not indicated to the city whether it would move forward with any of them.\n\nCopyright 2025 KBTX.

            "content": "This research is based on unique data collected from our proprietary audience of publisher, agency, brand and tech insiders. It\u2019s available to Digiday+ members. More from the series \u2192\n\nThis is the first installment of a two-part series on the top ad-supported streaming services. This initial report provides an overview of the various platforms\u2019 offerings, including pricing and plans, ad options and ad innovations, as well as an analysis of the platforms where brands and agencies distributed the bulk of their 2024 ad budgets and ad placements.\n\nThe second installment will dive deep into the results of Digiday\u2019s recent survey of brands and agencies to analyze how advertisers measure campaign success on the platforms and the challenges they face when placing ads on ad-supported streaming services.\n\n01 Introduction\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any stopping streaming video\u2019s popularity, as streaming services continue to rival linear TV for audience share. Streaming services accounted for 40.3% of total U.S. TV usage in June 2024, according to Nielsen \u2014 a new record high for the category. That\u2019s up from 38.7% in July 2023 and 38.4% in July 2022, when streaming claimed the largest share of U.S. TV viewing for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere is a shift happening in how and where viewers seek out and consume content,\u201d YouTube\u2019s managing director of U.S. video deals and creative works Brian Albert said in an email. \u201cStreaming households are overtaking pay TV households for the first time in the U.S., and outpacing linear TV growth across the globe. Much like the shifts from desktop to mobile \u2014 and now to CTV \u2014 viewers are driving this massive shift \u2014 streaming what they want, when they want.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile, cable and broadcast usage remained below 50% for the second year in a row in terms of total share among U.S. viewers, according to Nielsen. The broadcast category lost 1.8 share points in June versus the prior month and cable fell by 1 point, bringing the two to a combined 47.7% of overall TV in June 2024.\n\nWhile the U.S. video streaming market is seemingly saturated, reaching 96% of U.S. households and growing only 1% quarter over quarter as of Q2 2024, according to Kantar\u2019s Worldpanel Entertainment on Demand report, ad-supported video services are still driving growth in U.S. video streaming. Paid and free ad-supported streaming grew by roughly 6% in the second quarter of 2024, adding 3.8 million net users, while paid, ad-free streaming shrank its user base by -0.6%, according to Kantar.\n\nRoku\u2019s vp of ad marketing and measurement Sarah Harms said ad-supported streaming services appeal to both viewers and brands. \u201cWe certainly think streaming provides great consumer benefits, but also great advertiser benefits of greater addressability, greater accountability, and so we love that trend,\u201d Harms said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see that trend continue, and we\u2019re here for it.\u201d\n\nTaking note of consumers\u2019 increased interest in ad-supported streaming services, demand-side platform The Trade Desk is poised to be the next entrant into the streaming wars. In November 2024, The Trade Desk announced that it\u2019s building a CTV operating system called Ventura, which will give it direct control over the streaming TV experience and take a cut of the CTV platform market away from household names like Amazon, Roku and Samsung.\n\nBearing this increasing competition in mind, Digiday\u2019s fourth annual report on the state of ad-supported streaming services presents an industry-level look at the top ad-supported streaming platforms to assess:\n\n\n\nWhat the platforms offer advertisers and consumers, including plans and pricing, audience reach, and ad options\n\n\n\nWhere advertisers spent the bulk of their 2024 ad budgets, the metrics by which they judge campaign performance and challenges they face on the platforms\n\n02 Methodology\n\nDigiday identified the top-earning ad-supported streaming services by 2024 ad revenue and also included other popular platforms selected by the Digiday editorial team for their prominence. Here are those platforms in alphabetical order:\n\nAmazon Prime Video (with ads)\n\nDiscovery+\n\nDisney+ Basic (with ads)\n\nHulu\n\nMax\n\nNetflix Standard (with ads)\n\nParamount+\n\nPeacock\n\nPluto TV\n\nSamsung TV Plus\n\nThe Roku Channel\n\nTubi\n\nYouTube\n\nDigiday surveyed the 13 ad-supported streaming platforms about their basic data including pricing and plans, audience size, ad offerings, and ad innovations. Digiday updated data for platforms that did not provide updates when possible based on available information.\n\nDigiday interviewed executives at Peacock, Samsung, The Roku Channel and YouTube about their platforms\u2019 ad offerings and recent innovations.\n\n\n\nDigiday fielded a survey in February to 195 brand and agency professionals on their streaming platform buying behaviors and preferences.\n\n03 YouTube and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video vie for marketers\u2019 ad dollars\n\nYouTube came out on top for the third year in a row as the ad-supported streaming service that received the largest portion of both survey respondents\u2019 ad placements and ad budgets. Sixty-nine percent of brand and agency respondents said they currently place ads on YouTube as of Q1 2025. However, that is a drop from last year when 75% of respondents said the same, perhaps indicating that YouTube is experiencing some competition from Amazon\u2019s Prime Video (with ads). Amazon launched its ad-supported streaming platform in January 2024, and the service placed second among the platforms included in this year\u2019s report.\n\nThe percentage of marketers who said they invest in YouTube has also decreased slightly, Digiday\u2019s survey found. Half of respondents (50%) said YouTube consumed the largest portion of their ad budget in 2024, down from 60% who said the same in 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nEven though marketers\u2019 ad placements and ad spending on YouTube have decreased, YouTube remains a draw for advertisers in large part due to its audience reach. Generally speaking, YouTube has the largest audience size of the ad-supported streaming services assessed for this report, at 2 billion-plus monthly logged-in users, according to YouTube.\n\nAdditionally, while most ad-supported streaming platforms offer similar content in the form of on-demand movies and TV series, original movie and TV programming, and live TV channels, YouTube also stands out as the only platform that offers user-generated content, which YouTube refers to as creator content.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about brands understanding the importance of creators and the communities of engaged viewers they have amassed through their content,\u201d YouTube\u2019s Albert said. \u201cCreators are this generation\u2019s content studios and they\u2019re uploading new hits every day \u2014 fueling an always-on stream of fresh content that keeps viewers engaged. \u2026 When brands have creators in mind or bring them on board in their asset development and distribution \u2014 their campaigns feel more seamless and integrated to YouTube.\u201d\n\nYouTube also has access to Google\u2019s entire first-party search and browser history data because of its connection to Google\u2019s DSP (Display & Video 360), the dominant DSP in streaming and online advertising. Google, as the publisher of YouTube, can count its own user login data as its first-party data.\n\nFirst-party data reserves continue to be a selling point to attract advertisers, despite Google\u2019s July 2024 announcement that it will keep cookies in the Chrome browser. Fifty-four percent of brand and retailer professionals told Digiday in Q3 2024 that, in light of Google\u2019s new plan to let consumers decide whether to be tracked via cookies, they\u2019re more likely to continue to rely on cookies.\n\nAfter YouTube, Amazon\u2019s ad-supported tier Prime Video (with ads) came in second when it comes to where marketers are placing ads and spending their ad budgets, according to Digiday\u2019s survey. (Last year\u2019s report ranked Amazon\u2019s Freevee as a separate ad-supported streaming service. Amazon has since folded Freevee into Prime Video.)\n\nMore than a third of brands and agencies (38%) said that they place ads on Prime Video as of Q1 2025, up from 36% of marketers who said the same in Q1 2024. Sixteen percent of brands and agencies said in Q1 2025 that Amazon had the largest share of their company\u2019s 2024 ad-supported platform budget.\n\nLast year, Prime Video (with ads) tied with Hulu as the No. 2 ad-supported streaming service on which marketers place ads. Prime Video (with ads) was a new offering last year having launched on Jan. 24, 2024, but it has gained traction with advertisers over the past 12 months by fine-tuning its pitch to buyers and brands to highlight its growing measurement capabilities and new ad formats. Prime Video (with ads) has also kept its CPMs at a competitive level, forcing rivals to lower their own prices.\n\nLower CPMs have made it easier for buyers to recommend streaming ads to clients, according to Harry Browne, vp of TV, audio and display innovation at performance marketing agency Tinuiti. \u201c[Amazon\u2019s move] has dropped CPMs,\u201d Browne said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great time for us as an agency, because it means that we can really lean into streaming for our clients. And it has led to some great opportunities for them.\u201d\n\nWhile Prime Video (with ads) doesn\u2019t have nearly the audience reach of YouTube, it brings its own consumer audience and data benefits that appeal to advertisers. Prime Video\u2019s year-ago entry into the streaming ad market raised the stakes on its rivals because Amazon automatically opted in Prime subscribers to the streaming platform\u2019s ad-supported tier, a tactic that has enabled the e-commerce giant to report an average monthly ad-supported reach of more than 115 million customers in the U.S. and more than 200 million globally as of February 2025. But it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s strength as a sales platform that gives it an added advantage over other streaming platforms due to the sheer volume of consumer data it collects.\n\nAmazon is the third-most visited website in the U.S. \u2014 behind Google and YouTube \u2014 and it is the most visited e-commerce and shopping marketplace, according to web analytics company SimilarWeb. Due to the massive number of monthly visits to the site \u2014 3.1 billion total visits worldwide in December 2024 alone \u2014 Amazon is able to collect data from a wide range of demographic groups with varied audience interests. That means Amazon can offer agencies and brands access to a massive amount of consumers, and their data.\n\nHulu, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company, fell to third place regarding both marketers\u2019 ad placements and ad budgets in this year\u2019s report. Thirty-three percent of brands and agencies said they place ads on Hulu as of Q1 2025, down from 36% in Q1 2024. Eight percent of marketers said Hulu consumed the largest portion of their ad budget in 2024, down from 13% who said the same the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, the percentage of marketers who said they place ads on Disney+ Basic (with ads), which is also owned by The Walt Disney Company, increased year over year. Twenty-four percent of brands and agencies said that they place ads on Disney+ Basic (with ads) as of Q1 2025, up from 9% of marketers who said the same in Q1 2024. Overall, Disney+ Basic (with ads) tied for fifth place in Digiday\u2019s survey with Netflix Standard (with ads) and Peacock when it comes to where marketers place ads.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Hulu continues to appeal to advertisers in part because it has access to all of Disney\u2019s first-party consumer data through the company\u2019s Disney Select platform. That gives Hulu a similar competitive advantage to YouTube and Prime Video (with ads) in the race to provide advertisers with immense first-party data reserves. In general, streaming platforms that are owned by larger parent companies have an overall advantage when it comes to data access.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company also gives advertisers the option to buy ads across both Hulu and Disney+ in a single campaign. The two streaming platforms, along with sports streaming platform ESPN+, fall under the larger \u201cDisney Streaming\u201d banner.\n\nWhen it comes to audience size, Hulu trails behind YouTube and Prime Video (with ads). Hulu claimed 53.6 million U.S. subscribers as of February 2025.\n\nNext year\u2019s ad placements and budget allocation results could look very different from this year\u2019s, depending on the success of The Trade Desk\u2019s launch of its Ventura CTV operating system, which the ad tech platform announced it was building in November 2024. Having its OS baked into some of the world\u2019s most common TVs would widen the scope of data the DSP can control \u2014 what people are watching, what ads they\u2019re seeing \u2014 and feed that intel straight back into its own ad-buying platform. That would pave the way for even more growth in The Trade Desk\u2019s booming CTV ad business, which already makes up nearly half of its ad revenue.\n\nTinuiti\u2019s Browne said The Trade Desk\u2019s upcoming launch of Ventura could disrupt Roku and Samsung\u2019s dominance of the CTV market. \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting move for them. \u2026 The opportunity for Ventura is not immediately clear because there is a big presence in Samsung and Roku together operating the vast majority of operating systems,\u201d Browne said. \u201cThey have a real incumbency advantage and so I think the most important thing for The Trade Desk is going to be who they partner with and which manufacturer wants to put this operating system in their TV. \u2026 There have been some thoughts about how Ventura might be leveraged in unique environments, places like airplanes, airports, hotels. So, there could be some cool opportunities when it comes to the blending of CTV with out-of-home. But the impact is not immediately clear because of the incumbency that Samsung and Roku already have.\u201d\n\nIn April 2024, prior to The Trade Desk\u2019s Ventura announcement, Roku signed a deal with The Trade Desk to use Roku\u2019s audience data to target ads. When Digiday asked Roku\u2019s Harms about competition in the CTV marketplace, Harms said Roku is concentrating on its own OS and advertiser relationships. \u201cRoku is really keeping our head down and continuing to focus on having the best and biggest operating system in the landscape,\u201d Harms said.\n\n\u201cThe OS landscape is mature, and we\u2019ve increasingly seen players exiting the market, so we think consolidation will continue. We\u2019ll just see how the landscape evolves now, including another player in the space,\u201d she added. \u201cWe continue to work with them [The Trade Desk], but also a growing number of the DSPs and SSPs in the ecosystem. So, they\u2019ve been a great partner. We\u2019re just going to keep at being the best OS and continue to build great partnerships for our advertisers.\u201d\n\n04 A breakdown of platforms\u2019 plans, pricing and audience\n\nDespite some industry concerns that viewers might cancel their streaming subscriptions due to rising subscription prices, the amount of time U.S. viewers spent watching streaming services hit an all-time high at the end of last year. In December 2024, streaming\u2019s share of overall TV watch time reached 43.4%, according to Nielsen\u2019s The Gauge report, an increase of 9% since November 2024, which followed a 7.6% increase in November versus October.\n\nIn particular, ad-supported streaming, which is typically priced lower than ad-free tiers, seems to be holding its own among viewers. Over two-fifths of households (43%) are receptive to ad-supported streaming to save on monthly subscription rates, according to a study by Ernst & Young Global.\n\nExecutives at Disney and Netflix have been vocal about their respective ad-supported tiers\u2019 subscriber contributions. Ad-supported sign-ups accounted for more than half of Netflix\u2019s new subscribers in Q3 2024 for countries where its ad-supported tier is available, according to the company\u2019s letter to shareholders on Oct. 17. Disney CEO Bob Iger said during the company\u2019s earnings call in November 2024 that Disney increased Disney+\u2019s subscription price in order \u201cto move people in the AVOD direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, in the United States, about 60% of all new [Disney+] subs are going to \u2014 are buying our streaming services, advertising supported or AVOD. I think right now, I think it\u2019s 37% of total [Disney+] subs in the U.S. are AVOD subs \u2014 37% in the U.S. and 30% globally,\u201d Iger said.\n\nTo appeal to brands and consumers alike, the top ad-supported streaming services offer a variety of plans, pricing and ad options all in the hopes of winning viewers\u2019 attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.\n\nThe charts below present an overview of what the top ad-supported streaming services analyzed in this report offer consumers and advertisers. Data were collected via platform surveys, publicly available financial filings and documents, and additional Digiday reporting.\n\n* Data for asterisked platforms was compiled by Digiday after the platform did not respond to our request by the time of publication.\n\nAudience size varies, subscribers vs. active users\n\nGenerally speaking, YouTube had the largest audience size at 2 billion-plus monthly logged-in users as of February 2025, according to YouTube. After YouTube, Warner Bros. Discovery had a combined number of 110.5 million global subscribers for its direct-to-consumer segment, which includes Discovery+ and Max, as of Q3 2024, according to Warner Bros. Discovery. Meanwhile, Hulu had the smallest reported subscriber base of the platforms in this report that provided data at 53.6 million U.S. subscribers as of December 2024, according to Hulu.\n\nWhen it comes to audience growth, Netflix had the greatest year-over-year improvement, increasing from 23 million-plus global monthly active users in Q1 2024 to 70 million global active users as of November 2024, according to Netflix. To give some context, Netflix Standard with Ads launched in November 2022 and has been steadily building its subscriber base over the years. It had about 15 million monthly active users globally a year after its launch in November 2023.\n\nAudience size data was either provided by the platforms or culled from publicly available company filings and press releases. While audience numbers for general platform viewers are often publicly available, several platforms have not released numbers pertaining specifically to their ad-supported audiences, and thus data are not all-inclusive. Likewise, it is difficult to draw conclusive comparisons when considering active viewers versus subscribers.\n\nWhile audience size is a key factor for advertisers, it is only one piece of the puzzle. The audience demographic and customer persona can often play a more important role for advertisers looking to reach a specific type of customer.\n\nPricing plans range from free to $18.99 for ad-free options\n\nDigday\u2019s survey of ad-supported streaming services found that the platforms\u2019 plans and pricing run the gamut from no cost to as much as $18.99 per month for an ad-free option. Aiming to give viewers the most accessible of all entry points, five of the 13 platforms included in this report (excluding Prime Video, which is free to Amazon Prime subscribers who already pay a for a Prime membership) are free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services, with no monthly fee whatsoever for their ad-supported content.\n\nOf those five platforms, only YouTube offers the option to subscribe to an ad-free tier for a fee. That fee is $13.99/month for a standard YouTube account and does not include YouTube TV, which is $82.99/month. (YouTube didn\u2019t raise its standard account price since last year\u2019s report, but it did increase the cost of YouTube TV by $1/month.) In March 2025, YouTube announced that it would begin offering its Premium Lite pilot plan to U.S. users. Premium Lite gives users the option to \u201cenjoy most videos on YouTube ad-free\u201d for $7.99/month, according to YouTube.\n\n\n\nPrime Video also offers an ad-free tier for $2.99/month. However, that is on top of the $14.99/month or $139/year Amazon Prime subscription fee that members already pay. Consumers who don\u2019t have an Amazon Prime subscription can subscribe to Prime Video for $8.99/month.\n\nMeanwhile, seven of the 13 platforms charge a fee for their ad-supported subscriptions. The least expensive of those is Discovery+ at $5.99/month. Paramount+, Peacock and Netflix fall in the mid-range for pricing \u2014 all offering their ad-supported plans at $7.99/month. Disney+ Basic (with ads) and Hulu (both owned by The Walt Disney Company), along with Max (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, which also owns the least-expensive platform Discovery+) fall on the higher end of the spectrum.\n\nIn June 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery and The Walt Disney Company launched a cross-platform bundle of Disney+, Hulu and Max. The companies priced the three-platform bundle at $16.99/month with ads, or $29.99/month without ads. Likewise, The Walt Disney Company also offers bundled pricing for Disney+ and Hulu, and for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nAudience size may play a part in determining how much ad-supported streaming services charge, or don\u2019t charge, for access to their platforms. According to Digiday\u2019s analysis, FAST streaming services like Samsung TV Plus, The Roku Channel and YouTube boast sizable audience numbers and therefore can afford to offer their services at no cost to the consumer, relying instead on ad revenue from advertisers looking to reach those large audiences.\n\nSimilarly, Discovery+ has the lowest ad-supported subscription rate and also one of the higher audience sizes at 110.5 million for Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s direct-to-consumer segment. It could be that the platform offers lower subscription rates because it has the audience size to support healthy ad revenue.\n\nOn the flip side, Hulu\u2019s audience size is about half of that of Discovery+ at 53.4 million, and its subscription rate is one of the most expensive at $9.99/month for the ad-supported tier. It\u2019s possible that Hulu might rely on higher subscription pricing to offset a gap in advertiser revenue due to its smaller audience size.\n\n05 Platforms\u2019 ad options and AI-driven ad targeting\n\nDigiday asked the platforms included in this report what ad options they currently offer advertisers and what new ad offerings they\u2019ve instituted within the last 12 months. The chart above provides an overview of their current ad options.\n\nWhen it comes to deciding on which new ad offerings to institute, NBCUniversal\u2019s evp of strategy, advertising and partnerships Gina Reduto said the media company considers a variety of factors. \u201cWe really take a collaborative effort with brands to understand their objectives, then incorporate what we know about the viewer experience and the consumer, and work with them to figure out what types of ad innovations to leverage that will be most additive to the consumer\u2019s experience, but also most tailored to the objectives that the advertiser is trying to drive,\u201d Reduto said. \u201cIt\u2019s really all designed with the consumer in mind, and so it\u2019s more about aligning the innovation and the content to the objective that the advertiser is trying to drive.\u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that most marketers want their ads to reach their intended audiences as readily and precisely as possible. To aid them in that quest, six platforms told Digiday they have incorporated AI technology to improve ad targeting within the last year. Here\u2019s a look at how they\u2019re doing it:\n\nDisney+ and Hulu\u2019s Disney Magic Words is a contextual targeting ad tool that uses AI and machine learning to enhance ad targeting and personalization on Disney+ and Hulu by analyzing emotional cues, creative content and contextual information from Disney\u2019s library of movies and shows.

For the broader industry, we encourage folks to lean in!

And when you pair Peacock with the rest of the NBCU platform, we have the most ad-supported reach in the industry. So, the idea that advertisers can harness that and use it to drive immediate reach is really important.\u201d \u2014 NBCUniversal\u2019s Reduto\n\n06 Streamers up their game with gamified ads and branded experiences\n\nAlthough the streaming ad market is relatively new, traditional-TV style ads pervade the streaming marketplace.

However, the contact center function faces several challenges that can hinder efficient operations and overall customer satisfaction. The challenges listed below demand innovative solutions to provide seamless customer interactions and to maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace. Contact centers must address these operational challenges effectively. This enables them to deliver consistent customer service aligned with their brand values. Well-executed solutions help differentiate their service quality from competitors. The following challenges require strategic solutions to enhance contact center performance and deliver exceptional customer service:\n\nHigh Call Volume and Staffing Constraints: Contact centers grapple with managing high call volumes, particularly during peak periods. This surge in demand can lead to long wait times, frustrated customers, and potential revenue loss. Maintaining optimal staffing levels is a critical challenge for contact centers. Overstaffing increases labor costs and reduces efficiency. Understaffing results in longer wait times and compromises service quality.\n\nInconsistent Customer Experiences: Providing consistent and high-quality customer experiences across multiple channels and touchpoints can be a challenge. Variations in agent knowledge, communication styles, and problem-solving approaches can lead to inconsistent experiences, potentially eroding customer trust and loyalty.\n\nAgent Training and Knowledge Gaps: Training new agents requires resource investment. Keeping agents updated on multiple products and policies demand continuous learning programs. This ongoing training process affects operational productivity and budget allocation. Insufficient product knowledge among agents leads to increased call transfers, extended resolution times, and incorrect information delivery. When agents lack specific product expertise, customers often need to call back multiple times, face repeated transfers to specialized teams, and receive inconsistent answers to their technical questions.\n\nLack of Real-time Support: During live calls, agents may encounter unfamiliar or intricate situations which require immediate assistance or guidance. Without access to real-time support, agents may struggle to provide satisfactory resolutions, potentially impacting call quality, resolution times, and customer satisfaction.\n\nScalability and Cost Efficiency: As businesses grow and customer demand increases, contact centers must be able to scale their operations efficiently while maintaining cost-effectiveness. Achieving this balance can be challenging, as traditional methods of expanding resources may strain budgets and hinder profitability.\n\nLimited Post-call Analytics: Many contact centers lack robust post-call analytics capabilities, making it challenging to identify areas for improvement, monitor agent performance, and gather valuable customer insights. Without these insights, it becomes difficult to implement targeted strategies for enhancing operations and delivering exceptional customer experiences.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for innovative solutions that can empower contact centers to streamline operations, enhance agent performance, and deliver exceptional customer experiences while maintaining cost-efficiency and scalability.

            "content": "A 'Fortune 2': Amazon holds groundbreaking for Wilmington's first fulfillment center\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Amazon holds groundbreaking for facility in Wilmington, NC The facility will be the largest fulfillment center in the state.\n\nAmazon's new fulfillment center at Pender Commerce Park will be the state's largest and most technologically advanced.\n\nThe facility is expected to create over 1,000 jobs and generate millions in payroll and economic impact.\n\nThis project marks a significant expansion for Amazon in North Carolina, where the company already has a considerable presence.\n\nLocal officials believe the new facility will attract further investment and contribute to the region's economic growth.\n\nAn e-commerce giant is making headway on a long-awaited facility in the Wilmington area.\n\nAmazon held a groundbreaking ceremony for a new fulfillment center in Pender County on Wednesday, March 12. The facility will be North Carolina's largest and most technologically advanced robotics fulfillment center. It will span 3.2 million square feet across five stories and is currently 65% complete. The robotics center will employ over 1,000 people, instantly making the company one of Pender\u2019s top employers. Several Wilmington, New Hanover and Pender leaders attended the ceremony, including Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo.\n\n\u201cWhenever any of our businesses create a job or make a capital expenditure we've had a very good day,\u201d Saffo said. \u201cBut for a company to come in and invest big dollars and create a 1,000-person workforce, I'd call it a historic day for our region.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s new facility is being built at Pender Commerce Park on the Pender/New Hanover county line. The company will pay taxes in both counties. Amazon first announced its expansion into Wilmington in 2022 with a delivery station, but the project is still in the planning stages. Amazon\u2019s vice president of worldwide economic development Holly Sullivan said work on the \"last mile\" delivery station could begin in the coming months.\n\n\u201cTogether we're not just building a fulfillment center,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe're building an opportunity that will positively transform the Wilmington region and generate prosperity.\u201d\n\nStay informed: Accessing local journalism is even easier with the StarNews app\n\nNew Hanover County Board of Commissioners Chair Bill Rivenbark joked that while some counties brag about hosting a Fortune 500 company, Pender and New Hanover are welcoming a \"Fortune 2.\" Amazon ranks second on Fortune's global list behind Walmart.\n\nAmazon partnered with Wilmington Business Development to bring the company to the area. The company's president and chief executive officer Scott Satterfield said elected officials in the area help Wilmington attract large companies.\n\n\u201cWe have a reputation for business-friendly local government elected officials who understand the value of private investment and can work with business to create an environment where both the public and private sectors can thrive,\u201d Satterfield said. \u201cI think what many corporations like is that they can take our word when we say we welcome them here and will support their ongoing success.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing faster delivery service, Amazon\u2019s robotics facilities require 30% more employees in maintenance and engineering roles, according to the company\u2019s website. Robotics and artificial intelligence have been incorporated into new Amazon fulfillment centers to improve safety and working conditions.\n\nAmazon's statewide impact\n\nWhile the fulfillment center is Amazon\u2019s first venture into Wilmington, the company is no stranger to North Carolina. As of January 2024, the company had created 27,000 full and part-time jobs across the state. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that 26,400 indirect jobs were created as a result of Amazon\u2019s presence statewide.\n\nOver 11,000 independent North Carolina sellers use Amazon to distribute their products. Most of the sellers are small and medium-sized businesses. The company operates 13 fulfillment and sortation centers and 14 delivery stations across the state.\n\nThe company spent some time in Wilmington before settling down, with Amazon Prime Video series \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d filming all three seasons in the Port City. In 2024, the company came to Wilmington to shoot \u201cMerv,\u201d an upcoming romantic comedy starring Zooey Deschanel. Amazon\u2019s science fiction series \u201cThe Peripheral\u201d shot in Western North Carolina in 2021.\n\nPender Commerce Park is expected to be fully built out in 20 years, Pender County Board of Commissioners Chair Randy Burton said. Planning for the park began roughly 20 years ago with Acme Smoked Fish becoming the first tenant in 2013. The Amazon facility will generate more than $51 million in direct payroll each year and add nearly $164 million to the region's annual gross domestic product. Satterfield said that Wilmington Business Development approaches working with large companies like Amazon the same way it works with local partners.\n\n\"It\u2019s the same ingredients,\" Satterfield said. \"A growing, well-trained workforce, moderate costs, reliable transportation systems and business-savvy local leaders. We are in constant contact with companies already in the region who may need assistance embracing either challenges or opportunities. We can plug them into a deep menu of public and private resources in the form of our partners, allies and members.\"\n\nDaniel Sheehan covers New Hanover and Brunswick counties for the StarNews.

            "content": "Based on original post by Dr. Hemant Joshi, CTO, FloTorch.ai\n\nA recent evaluation conducted by FloTorch compared the performance of Amazon Nova models with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\nAmazon Nova is a new generation of state-of-the-art foundation models (FMs) that deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price-performance. The Amazon Nova family of models includes Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and Amazon Nova Pro, which support text, image, and video inputs while generating text-based outputs. These models offer enterprises a range of capabilities, balancing accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency.\n\nUsing its enterprise software, FloTorch conducted an extensive comparison between Amazon Nova models and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o models with the Comprehensive Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) benchmark dataset. FloTorch\u2019s evaluation focused on three critical factors\u2014latency, accuracy, and cost\u2014across five diverse topics.\n\nKey findings from the benchmark study:\n\nGPT-4o demonstrated a slight advantage in accuracy over Amazon Nova Pro\n\nAmazon Nova Pro outperformed GPT-4o in efficiency, operating 97% faster while being 65.26% more cost-effective\n\nwhile being Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite outperformed GPT-4o-mini by 2 percentage points in accuracy\n\nIn terms of affordability, Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite were 10% and 56.59% cheaper than GPT-4o-mini, respectively\n\nthan GPT-4o-mini, respectively Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite also demonstrated faster response times, with 48% and 26.60% improvements, respectively\n\nIn this post, we discuss the findings from this benchmarking in more detail.\n\nThe growing need for cost-effective AI models\n\nThe landscape of generative AI is rapidly evolving. OpenAI launched GPT-4o in May 2024, and Amazon introduced Amazon Nova models at AWS re:Invent in December 2024. Although GPT-4o has gained traction in the AI community, enterprises are showing increased interest in Amazon Nova due to its lower latency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are generally proficient in responding to user queries, but they sometimes generate overly broad or inaccurate responses. Additionally, LLMs might provide answers that extend beyond the company-specific context, making them unsuitable for certain enterprise use cases.\n\nOne of the most critical applications for LLMs today is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which enables AI models to ground responses in enterprise knowledge bases such as PDFs, internal documents, and structured data. This is a crucial requirement for enterprises that want their AI systems to provide responses strictly within a defined scope.\n\nTo better serve the enterprise customers, the evaluation aimed to answer three key questions:\n\nHow does Amazon Nova Pro compare to GPT-4o in terms of latency, cost, and accuracy?\n\nHow do Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite perform against GPT-4o mini in these same metrics?\n\nAmazon Nova How well do these models handle RAG use cases across different industry domains?\n\nBy addressing these questions, the evaluation provides enterprises with actionable insights into selecting the right AI models for their specific needs\u2014whether optimizing for speed, accuracy, or cost-efficiency.\n\nOverview of the CRAG benchmark dataset\n\nThe CRAG dataset was released by Meta for testing with factual queries across five domains with eight question types and a large number of question-answer pairs. Five domains in CRAG dataset are Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open (miscellaneous). The eight different question types are simple , simple_w_condition , comparison , aggregation , set , false_premise , post-processing , and multi-hop . The following table provides example questions with their domain and question type.\n\nDomain Question Question Type Sports Can you carry less than the maximum number of clubs during a round of golf? simple Music Can you tell me how many grammies were won by arlo guthrie until 60th grammy (2017)? simple_w_condition Open Can i make cookies in an air fryer? simple Finance Did meta have any mergers or acquisitions in 2022? simple_w_condition Movie In 2016, which movie was distinguished for its visual effects at the oscars? simple_w_condition\n\nThe evaluation considered 200 queries from this dataset representing five domains and two question types, simple and simple_w_condition . Both types of questions are common from users, and a typical Google search for the query such as \u201cCan you tell me how many grammies were won by arlo guthrie until 60th grammy (2017)?\u201d will not give you the correct answer (one Grammy). FloTorch used these queries and their ground truth answers to create a subset benchmark dataset. The CRAG dataset also provides top five search result pages for each query. These five webpages act as a knowledge base (source data) to limit the RAG model\u2019s response. The goal is to index these five webpages dynamically using a common embedding algorithm and then use a retrieval (and reranking) strategy to retrieve chunks of data from the indexed knowledge base to infer the final answer.\n\nEvaluation setup\n\nThe RAG evaluation pipeline consists of the several key components, as illustrated in the following diagram.\n\nIn this section, we explore each component in more detail.\n\nKnowledge base\n\nFloTorch used the top five HTML webpages provided with the CRAG dataset for each query as the knowledge base source data. HTML pages were parsed to extract text for the embedding stage.\n\nChunking strategy\n\nFloTorch used a fixed chunking strategy with a chunk size of 512 tokens (four characters is usually around one token) and a 10% overlap between chunks. Further experiments with different chunking strategies, chunk sizes, and percent overlap will be done in coming weeks and will update this post.\n\nEmbedding strategy\n\nFloTorch used the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 model on Amazon Bedrock with an output vector size of 1024. With a maximum input token limit of 8,192 for the model, the system successfully embedded chunks from the knowledge base source data as well as short queries from the CRAG dataset efficiently. Amazon Bedrock APIs make it straightforward to use Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 for embedding data.\n\nVector database\n\nFloTorch selected Amazon OpenSearch Service as a vector database for its high-performance metrics. The implementation included a provisioned three-node sharded OpenSearch Service cluster. Each provisioned node was r7g.4xlarge, selected for its availability and sufficient capacity to meet the performance requirements. FloTorch used HSNW indexing in OpenSearch Service.\n\nRetrieval (and reranking) strategy\n\nFloTorch used a retrieval strategy with a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) of five for retrieved chunks. The experiments excluded reranking algorithms to make sure retrieved chunks remained consistent for both models when inferring the answer to the provided query. The following code snippet embeds the given query and passes the embeddings to the search function:\n\ndef search_results(interaction_ids: List[str], queries: List[str], k: int): \"\"\"Retrieve search results for queries.\"\"\" results = [] embedding_max_length = int(os.getenv(\"EMBEDDING_MAX_LENGTH\", 1024)) normalize_embeddings = os.getenv(\"NORMALIZE_EMBEDDINGS\", \"True\").lower() == \"true\" for interaction_id, query in zip(interaction_ids, queries): try: _, _, embedding = create_embeddings_with_titan_bedrock(query, embedding_max_length, normalize_embeddings) results.append(search(interaction_id + '_titan', embedding, k)) except Exception as e: logger.error(f\"Error processing query {query}: {e}\") results.append(None) return results\n\nInferencing\n\nFloTorch used the GPT-4o model from OpenAI using the API key available and used the Amazon Nova Pro model with conversation APIs. GPT-4o supports a context window of 128,000 compared to Amazon Nova Pro with a context window of 300,000. The maximum output token limit of GPT-4o is 16,384 vs. the Amazon Nova Pro maximum output token limit of 5,000. The benchmarking experiments were conducted without Amazon Bedrock Guardrails functionality. The implementation used the universal gateway provided by the FloTorch enterprise version to enable consistent API calls using the same function and to track token count and latency metrics uniformly. The inference function code is as follows:\n\ndef generate_responses(dataset_path: str, model_name: str, batch_size: int, api_endpoint: str, auth_header: str, max_tokens: int, search_k: int, system_prompt: str): \"\"\"Generate response for queries.\"\"\" results = [] for batch in tqdm(load_data_in_batches(dataset_path, batch_size), desc=\"Generating responses\"): interaction_ids = [item[\"interaction_id\"] for item in batch] queries = [item[\"query\"] for item in batch] search_results_list = search_results(interaction_ids, queries, search_k) for i, item in enumerate(batch): item[\"search_results\"] = search_results_list[i] responses = send_batch_request(batch, model_name, api_endpoint, auth_header, max_tokens, system_prompt) for i, response in enumerate(responses): results.append({ \"interaction_id\": interaction_ids[i], \"query\": queries[i], \"prediction\": response.get(\"choices\", [{}])[0].get(\"message\", {}).get(\"content\") if response else None, \"response_time\": response.get(\"response_time\") if response else None, \"response\": response, }) return results\n\nEvaluation\n\nBoth models were evaluated by running batch queries. A batch of eight was selected to comply with Amazon Bedrock quota limits as well as GPT-4o rate limits. The query function code is as follows:\n\ndef send_batch_request(batch: List[Dict], model_name: str, api_endpoint: str, auth_header: str, max_tokens: int, system_prompt: str): \"\"\"Send batch queries to the API.\"\"\" headers = {\"Authorization\": auth_header, \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"} responses = [] for item in batch: query = item[\"query\"] query_time = item[\"query_time\"] retrieval_results = item.get(\"search_results\", []) references = \"# References\n\n\" + \"\n\n\".join( [f\"Reference {_idx + 1}:\n\n{res['text']}\n\n\" for _idx, res in enumerate(retrieval_results)]) user_message = f\"{references}\n\n------\n\n\n\nUsing only the references listed above, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: {query}\n\n\" payload = { \"model\": model_name, \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_message}], \"max_tokens\": max_tokens, } try: start_time = time.time() response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload, timeout=25000) response.raise_for_status() response_json = response.json() response_json['response_time'] = time.time() - start_time responses.append(response_json) except requests.RequestException as e: logger.error(f\"API request failed for query: {query}. Error: {e}\") responses.append(None) return responses\n\nBenchmarking on the CRAG dataset\n\nIn this section, we discuss the latency, accuracy, and cost measurements of benchmarking on the CRAG dataset.\n\nLatency\n\nLatency measurements for each query response were calculated as the difference between two timestamps: the timestamp when the API call is made to the inference LLM, and a second timestamp when the entire response is received from the inference endpoint. The difference between these two timestamps determines the latency. A lower latency indicates a faster-performing LLM, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid response times. The study indicates that latency can be further reduced for both models through optimizations and caching techniques; however, the evaluation focused on measuring out-of-the-box latency performance for both models.\n\nAccuracy\n\nFloTorch used a modified version of the local_evaluation.py script provided with the CRAG benchmark for accuracy evaluations. The script was enhanced to provide proper categorization of correct, incorrect, and missing responses. The default GPT-4o evaluation LLM in the evaluation script was replaced with the mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1 model API. Additional modifications to the script enabled monitoring of input and output tokens and latency as described earlier.\n\nCost\n\nCost calculations were straightforward because both Amazon Nova Pro and GPT-4o have published price per million input and output tokens separately. The calculation methodology involved multiplying input tokens by corresponding rates and applying the same process for output tokens. The total cost for running 200 queries was determined by combining input token and output token costs. OpenSearch Service provisioned cluster costs were excluded from this analysis because the cost comparison focused solely on the inference level between Amazon Nova Pro and GPT-4o LLMs.\n\nResults\n\nThe following table summarizes the results.\n\n. Amazon Nova Pro GPT-4o Observation Accuracy on subset of the CRAG dataset 51.50% (103 correct responses out of 200) 53.00% (106 correct responses out of 200) GPT-4o outperforms Amazon Nova Pro by 1.5% on accuracy Cost for running inference for 200 queries $0.00030205 $0.000869537 Amazon Nova Pro saves 65.26% in costs compared to GPT-4o Average latency (seconds) 1.682539835 2.15615045 Amazon Nova Pro is 21.97% faster than GPT-4o Average of input and output tokens 1946.621359 1782.707547 Typical GPT-4o responses are shorter than Amazon Nova responses\n\nFor simple queries, Amazon Nova Pro and GPT-4o have similar accuracies (55 and 56 correct responses, respectively) but for simple queries with conditions, GPT-4o performs slightly better than Amazon Nova Pro (50 vs. 48 correct answers). Imagine you are part of an organization running an AI assistant service that handles 1,000 questions per month from 10,000 users (10,000,000 queries per month). Amazon Nova Pro will save your organization $5,674.88 per month ($68,098 per year) compared to GPT-4o.\n\nLet\u2019s look at similar results for Amazon Nova Micro, Amazon Nova Lite, and GPT-4o mini models on the same dataset.\n\nAmazon Nova Lite Nova Micro GPT-4o mini Observation Accuracy on subset of the CRAG dataset 52.00% (104 correct responses out of 200) 54.00% (108 correct responses out of 200) 50.00% (100 correct responses out of 200) Both Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Micro outperform GPT-4o mini by 2 and 4 points, respectively Cost for running inference for 200 queries $0.00002247 (56.59% cheaper than GPT-4o mini) $0.000013924 (73.10% cheaper than GPT-4o mini) $0.000051768 Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Micro are cheaper than GPT-4o mini by 56.59% and 73.10%, respectively Average latency (seconds) 1.553371465 (26.60% faster than GPT-4o mini) 1.6828564 (20.48% faster than GPT-4o mini) 2.116291895 Amazon Nova models are at least 20% faster than GPT-4o mini Average of input and output tokens 1930.980769 1940.166667 1789.54 GPT-4o mini returns shorter answers\n\nAmazon Nova Micro is significantly faster and less expensive compared to GPT-4o mini while providing more accurate answers. If you are running a service that handles about 10 million queries each month, it will save you on average 73% of what you will be paying for slightly less accurate results from the GPT-4o mini model.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on these tests for RAG cases, Amazon Nova models produce comparable or higher accuracy at significantly lower cost and latency compared to GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models.

            "content": "The retail sector in the United States is competitive, and Amazon has steadily gained ground, driven by a surge in discretionary spending.\n\nAccording to the PYMNTS Intelligence Whole Paycheck Report, \u201cWalmart or Amazon: Where Do Consumers Spend \u2018Fun\u2019 Money?,\u201d discretionary spending covers \u201cwants\u201d rather than \u201cneeds.\u201d It represents the products and services that consumers buy when they have disposable income, such as electronics, clothing, travel, dining out and other nonessential items. Amazon has become the preferred destination for many of these purchases, as consumers rely on the eCommerce giant for everything from electronics to apparel.\n\nRead also: Amazon Overtook Walmart in Quarterly Revenue in Q4\n\nAmazon\u2019s Foothold in Electronics and Appliances\n\nIn the last quarter of 2024, Amazon made inroads across multiple product categories, the report found. Amazon captured 30% of the total sales in the electronics and appliances sector. This dominance in the electronics market shows Amazon\u2019s appeal to consumers who prioritize convenience, competitive pricing and fast shipping. The ease of browsing Amazon\u2019s inventory, coupled with its one-click purchasing feature and rapid delivery options, has further solidified its role as a leader in discretionary spending.\n\nDespite its strength in nonessential categories, Amazon has also seen modest but considerable growth in food and beverage sales, the report revealed. Although the company has historically struggled to compete with Walmart, the largest grocery retailer in the U.S., Amazon has been slowly chipping away at Walmart\u2019s dominance.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon\u2019s share of the total U.S. food and beverage market rose to 2.7%, up from 2.3% the previous year. This may seem like a small increase, but it\u2019s indicative of Amazon\u2019s larger strategy to expand beyond its traditional product categories and tap into the lucrative grocery market. Amazon\u2019s steady growth in food and beverages signals the company is positioning itself as a serious competitor to Walmart, even in this essential category.\n\nOne factor driving Amazon\u2019s expanding market share is its aggressive pricing strategies and personalized shopping experiences, the report found. The company has used large amounts of customer data to tailor recommendations and create targeted promotions, encouraging consumers to make more frequent purchases. Amazon\u2019s advertising campaigns are another tool that helps keep the brand at the forefront of consumers\u2019 minds, driving more traffic to its platform. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s digital experience \u2014 combined with its product selection \u2014 gives the company an advantage over traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, especially in high-demand categories like electronics and appliances.\n\nSee also: Amazon Mobile Shopping App Features Products From Other Sites\n\nWalmart Struggles to Keep Up With Changing Preferences\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth contrasts with the performance of its main competitor, Walmart, according to the report. Despite its dominance in the grocery sector, Walmart has struggled to increase its share of total retail spending in recent years. For the year ending Jan. 31, 2025, Walmart\u2019s share of the U.S. retail market was stagnant, with no notable spike in spending during the holiday season. This lack of growth is especially concerning given the typically strong sales period in the final months of the year. Walmart\u2019s market share has remained relatively unchanged since the third quarter of 2020, hovering just under 7.6% of total consumer retail spending.\n\nWalmart\u2019s slowdown is opposite to Amazon\u2019s upward trajectory. While Walmart has maintained its stronghold on groceries and other essential goods, it has struggled to attract shoppers for discretionary products such as electronics, apparel and home goods, per the report. The retailer\u2019s eCommerce efforts, though growing, account for a fraction of its overall sales, leaving it at a disadvantage as consumers turn to online shopping for convenience and variety.\n\nAs Amazon continues to capture a larger share of discretionary spending, Walmart faces the challenge of adapting to the changing retail environment. While its consistent performance underscores its reliability as a go-to destination for everyday essentials, it highlights the broader trend of consumers favoring online platforms like Amazon for a more diverse shopping experience. The disparity in growth trajectories suggests Amazon is winning the battle for consumer dollars in nonessential categories, leaving Walmart to play catch-up in a digitally focused retail environment.",

            "content": "Amazon forest felled to build road for climate summit\n\n1 day ago Share Save Ione Wells Bel\u00e9m, Brazil Share Save\n\nWatch: Drone shots show scale of Amazon deforestation for COP30 road\n\nA new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m. It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November. The state government touts the highway's \"sustainable\" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact. The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.\n\nAlong the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Bel\u00e9m. Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area.\n\nBBC / Paulo Koba\n\nClaudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed berries from trees that once occupied the space. \"Everything was destroyed,\" he says, gesturing at the clearing. \"Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.\" He says he has received no compensation from the state government and is currently relying on savings. He worries the construction of this road will lead to more deforestation in the future, now that the area is more accessible for businesses. \"Our fear is that one day someone will come here and say: 'Here's some money. We need this area to build a gas station, or to build a warehouse.' And then we'll have to leave. \"We were born and raised here in the community. Where are we going to go?\"\n\nBBC / Paulo Koba Claudio Verequete says the trees he harvested a\u00e7a\u00ed from have been cut down\n\nHis community won't be connected to the road, given its walls on either side. \"For us who live on the side of the highway, there will be no benefits. There will be benefits for the trucks that will pass through. If someone gets sick, and needs to go to the centre of Bel\u00e9m, we won't be able to use it.\" The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife. Prof Silvia Sardinha is a wildlife vet and researcher at a university animal hospital that overlooks the site of the new highway. She and her team rehabilitate wild animals with injuries, predominantly caused by humans or vehicles.\n\nBBC / Paulo Koba Sloths are among the animals frequently needing treatment after injuries caused by humans\n\nOnce healed, they release them back into the wild \u2013 something she says will be harder if there is a highway on their doorstep. \"From the moment of deforestation, there is a loss. \"We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species,\" she said. \"Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side too, reducing the areas where they can live and breed.\" The Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is \"a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon\". The president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it. But Prof Sardinha says that while these conversations will happen \"at a very high level, among business people and government officials\", those living in the Amazon are \"not being heard\".\n\nThe state government of Par\u00e1 had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns. Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit. Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, listed this highway as one of 30 projects happening in the city to \"prepare\" and \"modernise\" it, so \"we can have a legacy for the population and, more importantly, serve people for COP30 in the best possible way\". Speaking to the BBC, he said it was a \"sustainable highway\" and an \"important mobility intervention\". He added it would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, bike lanes and solar lighting. New hotels are also being built and the port is being redeveloped so cruise ships can dock there to accommodate excess visitors. Brazil's federal government is investing more than $81m (\u00a362m) to expand the airport capacity from \"seven to 14 million passengers\". A new 500,000 sq-m city park, Parque da Cidade, is under construction. It will include green spaces, restaurants, a sports complex and other facilities for the public to use afterwards.\n\nBBC / Paulo Koba Jo\u00e3o Alexandre Trindade da Silva hopes COP30 will leave a great legacy for the people of Par\u00e1 state\n\nSome business owners in the city's vast open-air Ver-o-peso market agree that this development will bring opportunities for the city. \"The city as a whole is being improved, it is being repaired and a lot of people are visiting from other places. It means I can sell more and earn more,\" says Dalci Cardoso da Silva, who runs a leather shoe stall. He says this is necessary because when he was young, Bel\u00e9m was \"beautiful, well-kept, well cared for\", but it has since been \"abandoned\" and \"neglected\" with \"little interest from the ruling class\".\n\nJo\u00e3o Alexandre Trindade da Silva, who sells Amazonian herbal medicines in the market, acknowledges that all construction work can cause problems, but he felt the future impact would be worth it. \"We hope the discussions aren't just on paper and become real actions. And the measures, the decisions taken, really are put into practice so that the planet can breathe a little better, so that the population in the future will have a little cleaner air.\" That will be the hope of world leaders too who choose to attend the COP30 summit. Scrutiny is growing over whether flying thousands of them across the world, and the infrastructure required to host them, is undermining the cause.",

            "content": "Last month, Ofcom, the United Kingdom\u2019s telecom regulator, granted Amazon\u2019s Kuiper Systems a license to provide low-Earth orbit-based (LEO) broadband Internet in the country. The move places Kuiper systems in a rival position with the industry leader, and SpaceX subsidiary, Starlink Services. And while more specialized LEO broadband Internet interests are also emerging\u2014in the public and private sectors\u2014Ofcom\u2019s decision signifies an important shift in consumer LEO internet providers. The game is shifting, in other words, from a single-player to a multiplayer one.\n\nWhich is not to say, however, that the game today is evenly matched. As one analyst from Copenhagen-based Strand Consult recently put it in the industry publication Broadband Breakfast, Kuiper now is just \u201ca burger bar, while [Starlink Services] runs an interstellar McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn fact, \u201cburger bar\u201d is being charitable.\n\nAccording to satellite industry data clearinghouse planet4589.org, as of this story\u2019s publication, Starlink had 7,050 active satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Whereas Kuiper Systems has only two prototype satellites now in the sky. The company\u2019s first non-prototype launch is currently being slated for an as-yet unspecified date this year. In addition, as Kuiper parent company Amazonannounced on social media in late January, \u201canother batch\u201d of satellites was at the time headed to Cape Canaveral to be prepared to be lofted into space as well. Assuming both Kuiper launches can happen soon and without a hitch, that would still leave a huge gap between the number of deployed Kuiper satellites and the 1,663 that Kuiper Systems\u2019 FCC license mandates being in orbit and operational by July 2026.\n\nKuiper\u2019s Satellite Catch-up\n\nTo be fair, Kuiper Systems hasn\u2019t exactly been sitting idle. Scott Palo, professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder, says that establishing an inter-satellite optical communications network is one of the biggest challenges in satellite-based wireless and broadband networks. The technology is based on free-space optical links\u2014laser light beamed between the fast-moving satellites that transfers data at high rates, enabling the data to be transmitted to an appropriate ground station. And Kuiper already demonstrated the orbiting system\u2019s capacity to optically interconnect at the end of 2023.\n\nMeaning that Kuiper has at least demonstrated the capability to do what Starlink Services has been doing day in and day out since 2021, when the SpaceX subsidiary first launched laser-interconnect satellites as part of its emerging LEO internet constellation.\n\n\u201cThe pointing challenge is multi-faceted,\u201d Palo says. \u201cThe first challenge is just trying to find the other terminal. Consider standing at opposite ends of a football field with a friend. You and your friend each have a laser pointer and are looking at each other through a straw.\u201d\n\nBut of course, he adds, for a satellite internet constellation like Starlink or Kuiper, the friends looking through straws on either ends of a football pitch are each moving rapidly and following trajectories that can be challenging to track and forecast.\n\nTo get as precise a fix as possible on each satellite\u2019s orbit, says Kerri Cahoy, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics, requires a whole different constellation orbiting higher still. GPS satellites are in medium-earth orbit (MEO) at some 20,200 kilometers above the earth. By comparison, satellite-based broadband systems operate well below GPS orbits, at altitudes of between 340 km and 630 km\u2014for Starlink and Kuiper satellites\u2014and at 1,200 km orbit, for the competing LEO broadband constellation OneWeb.\n\nIn October 2023, Amazon subsidiary Kuiper Systems launched a prototype pair of satellites to test the company\u2019s satellite broadband technologies. Amazon\n\n\u201cYou need to have well-determined orbits on each of the satellites\u2014they each need to know where to point,\u201d Cahoy says. \u201cIn low-Earth orbit they use both GPS receivers as well as high precision attitude determination and control systems\u2014star trackers with reaction wheels.\u201d\n\nCahoy and Palo take a different view, however, about just how essential optical interconnects are for a functional LEO broadband constellation.\n\nOptical interconnects, Palo says, \u201care critical for a connected space ecosystem.\u201d Satellite-to-satellite interconnects that use radio communications instead, he adds, \u201ccannot compete with the performance of optical systems and space-to-space communications over long ranges.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Cahoy notes that while a good optical interconnect system can be quite effective, \u201cit\u2019s possible to have a successful service without optical,\u201d she says. Connecting a satellite broadband network together via radio frequency communications\u2014as SpaceX first did in 2019 and 2020 when it was first testing the Starlink system\u2014is still doable, in her opinion.\n\nPlus, while laser interconnects are fundamental to Starlink operations today, she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll learn more about how well the optical systems hold up in terms of lifetime and aging in the space environment.\u201d\n\nStarlink\u2019s LEO Dominance\n\nStarlink satellites constitute more than half of the active satellites now in orbit around the Earth, says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cParticularly in low Earth orbit, they\u2019re dominating,\u201d says McDowell, who\u2019s also founder and data keeper at planet4589.org. \u201cAnd in terms of large satellites in the lower orbits, they\u2019re really hugely dominating.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, even with Starlink\u2019s oversized orbital footprint today, LEO Internet constellations still face bottlenecks in the total number of subscribers they can serve. In 2021, the New York-based consulting firm Moffett Nathanson published a technical white paper estimating that, even with aggressive launch schedules and high consumer demand for bandwidth, Starlink might only be able to provide Internet connectivity to no more than one percent of households in the United States. Commenting on his firm\u2019s forecast with present-day numbers, analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson says that while a few factors in the firm\u2019s original calculations had changed in the intervening four years (e.g. more satellites in orbit, but with lower-speed connections than anticipated), \u201cStarlink\u2019s addressable market remains tightly capacity constrained.\u201d\n\nAn actuator constitutes a step on the solar array assembly line for a Kuiper Systems satellite\u2014one element of a next wave in satellite-based broadband internet. Amazon\n\nDanielle Wood, director of the Space Enabled Research Group at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, says Starlink and Kuiper don\u2019t optimally serve densely populated regions of the globe. \u201cI\u2019m in Boston,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t need satellite-based Internet. I\u2019ve got fiber and various other options that are fine. People who need this are in rural areas that have low population densities.\u201d\n\nWhich still leaves plenty of the planet yet to be connected to reliable broadband\u2014or even reliable cell service. And in that world, Kuiper and Starlink are the big contenders today. But they\u2019re not the only players on the field, or potential players looking to get in the game.\n\nLondon-based EutelSat OneWeb, for example, is operating a constellation of more than 650 active satellites for government and maritime broadband and wireless. And according to McDowell, China is expected to begin rolling out their own LEO Internet and wireless constellation\u2014ultimately of some 20,000 or more satellites. (Which is already more than the 14,000 anticipated satellites that Spectrum reported China would be launching last August.) \u201cAnd then following the use of Starlink in Ukraine,\u201d McDowell adds, \u201cA lot of militaries around the world are starting to go, \u2018Huh, we want these. And we\u2019re not going to use Elon\u2019s. We want our ones under our own control.\u2019\u201d\n\nCollision Avoidance in LEO Satellite Orbits\n\nAdd up all these LEO broadband ambitions\u2014commercial, military, and national\u2014over the next decade, McDowell says, and the number of active satellites in the sky would jump from today\u2019s approximate 10,000 count to something closer to 100,000.\n\nAnd that could be a problem.\n\nNearly 50 years ago, NASA scientists envisioned a future in which the amount of stuff zipping around in LEO reaches a threshold, beyond which navigating some earth orbits could ultimately produce cascading storms of collisions with satellites, space junk, and debris from previous collisions. The phenomenon, called the Kessler syndrome after one of the scientists, Donald Kessler, represents a cautionary tale that\u2019s been explored\u2014with some dramatic embellishments\u2014in the 2013 movie Gravity and in Neal Stephenson\u2019s 2015 novel Seveneves.\n\nMcDowell says he expects that the Kessler syndrome could emerge as a real concern in LEO somewhere between the 10,000 and 100,000 satellite count. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to find out the hard way,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat\u2019s not guesswork is the amount of collision avoidance that present-day LEO satellites need to perform all the time. According to filings with the FCC, Starlink satellites performed more than 50,000 collision-avoidance maneuvers between June and November of last year.\n\n\u201cBefore Starlink, the most people maneuvered their active satellites was a few times, typically,\u201d McDowell says. \u201cMaybe a hundred times in a very maneuverable mission. And so having that number of maneuvers is just enormously more than we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nMIT\u2019s Wood has helped to develop numerical models for LEO satellite collision-avoidance maneuvers, and she agrees that the rate of collision threats in LEO today is growing at an astonishing rate. In fact, her group is championing a space sustainability rating system that encourages open dialogue between LEO satellite operators and the space industry. To date, she says, OneWeb is the only LEO satellite provider to earn the rating system\u2019s highest space sustainability score.\n\nTo keep the LEO Internet broadband industry thriving, and the Kessler syndrome ultimately at bay, she says, more cooperation and communication between companies and governments is needed. \u201cWe can\u2019t maintain the same pace of just adding new satellites in a way that\u2019s going to guarantee safety,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all want to have great communication satellites and NASA science satellites and other satellites for weather, for example, that are all going to work together safely in space. And we\u2019re not on a path toward doing that well.\u201d",

Amazon's investment will create at least 25 jobs at the new facility that is expected to open by 2027 at 33 Innovation Park, southwest of the Scotts facility.\n\n\u201cThis investment by AWS represents a significant step forward for Marysville and Union County,\u201d Terry Emery, city manager for Marysville said in a press release. \u201cIt reinforces our city\u2019s ability to attract leading technology companies and showcases our commitment to fostering economic growth and job creation.\u201d\n\nRelated data center article: Data centers galore? How do Ohio's data center numbers stack up against other states?\n\nAs part of its investment in Marysville, Amazon plans to provide more than $15 million to the Marysville Exempted Village School District and city over 15 years, according to the city. Amazon will also support infrastructure improvements benefiting the 33 Innovation Park and will build community partnerships with local nonprofit agencies.\n\nAmazon Web Services has been steadily expanding its Ohio footprint since its first data centers opened in the state 10 years ago.\n\nThe new facility is expected to support thousands of additional jobs in construction and other local industries, according to the city. By 2030, Amazon Web Service's investment in data center expansion in Ohio is estimated to surpass $23 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to reinforce our long-term commitment to the State of Ohio with plans to expand AWS cloud infrastructure in the city of Marysville,\u201d Roger Wehner, vice president of economic development at Amazon Web Services said in a press release. \u201cWorking with state and local leaders, we look forward to investing in the local community, strengthening its local workforce, enhancing educational opportunities, and contributing to the city\u2019s long-term growth.\u201d\n\nAmazon's latest data center investment comes weeks after the company spent more than $100 million to purchase two parcels of land for data centers in Fayette County next to Honda and LG's battery plant.\n\nAmazon Data Services Inc. purchased 243 acres of land for $60.2 million just outside Jeffersonville, according to records filed with the Fayette County Auditor. Amazon also purchased 346 acres for almost $42.2 million, records show.\n\nConstruction on the Fayette County data centers was expected to begin early this year and Amazon plans to spend $5 billion in Fayette County alone by 2030 on new data centers, a spokesperson for the company told The Dispatch.\n\nRead More: Google wants to bolster Ohio's power grid as it expands in the state: Here's how\n\nAs data centers have popped up throughout the region, they've brought with them concerns about electric use.\n\nThe surge in data centers means Ohio is expected to eat up so much electricity that demand for power in the region will be similar to all of Manhattan by 2030, according to American Electric Power.\n\nAs of May, AEP's transmission system in central Ohio was serving about 600 megawatts of load from data centers. By comparison, that's enough to power as many as 250,000 homes, according to the company.\n\nLocal leaders and state legislators have sounded the alarm on how Ohio needs to keep up with power demand. A report released last month by the Ohio Business Roundtable found that Ohio could face energy shortfalls by 2027 if nothing is done to keep up with power supply.\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby\n\nThis story was updated to add a photo gallery.",

While that's cheap for Amazon, it's not the cheapest on a relative basis to other \"Magnificent Seven\" stalwarts.\n\nThat distinguished honor goes to fellow cloud competitor Microsoft (MSFT), whose stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.9 times.\n\nLower valuations for these top tech names come amid a broader rout in markets as traders digest the potential for a recession under tariff-wielding president Trump.\n\nListen: Why Rubbermaid's CEO is worried about tariffs\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped 890 points, or about 2.1% on Monday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 2.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 4%.\n\nAll three major indexes are off by more than 5% in the past month, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way with an 11% plunge. Amazon shares have tanked 16.5% in the last month.\n\n\"After a historical bull market led by the AI Revolution over the past two years we are now seeing major investor worries as the Trump tariff news, perceived recession fears, and tech growth concerns have sent tech investors for the exits and heading for the hills,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nNot helping sentiment on Amazon (and to a lesser extent, Microsoft) is a mixed fourth quarter that stoked concerns about near-term demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS sales cooled a touch to a 19% year-over-year growth rate. This result was consistent with cloud growth slowdowns at Microsoft and the like.\n\nAmazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion; the miss was partially due to a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations.\n\n\"Our discussions w/investors suggest the quarter & outlook were not thesis-changing for the well-owned name, but there are incremental concerns around the trajectory of AWS growth, & to a lesser degree the macro impact on Stores,\" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note.\n\nIt remains to be seen if investors view Amazon's stock as cheap enough at current valuation levels given economic growth fears.

Those are indeed the new prices, but we are talking about some serious savings here on a device that is very rarely discounted in unlocked new condition and is now at a new low from a reputable refurbished dealer.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Amazon offers up loads of refurbished gear on its site, but the Renewed Premium listings like we have here today are the best of them. They ship higher-quality, better condition units with a full 1-year warranty to boot. Here are some details:\n\nAmazon Renewed is your trusted destination for pre-owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new. Any repairs are made with Apple components that are new, or reused and in like-new condition. The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away, batteries with at least 80% capacity relative to new, and may arrive in a brown or white box with relevant accessories (no headphones included) that may be generic.\n\nWhile for some, myself included, the Pro and Pro Max models are a better investment if you\u2019re looking to score a deal on a previous-generation iPhone. They are after all more powerful devices and the only other models outside of the latest series 16 handsets that can run Apple Intelligence. But, having said that, and as much as I believe the pro units to be a more future proof investment anyway, I also know plenty of folks that couldn\u2019t care less about Apple intelligence.

Model evaluation provides built-in curated datasets, or you can bring in your own datasets.\n\nWe strongly recommend integrating Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and using Amazon Bedrock model evaluation features with your DeepSeek-R1 model to add robust protection for your generative AI applications. To learn more, visit Protect your DeepSeek model deployments with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and Evaluate the performance of Amazon Bedrock resources.\n\nGet started with the DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock\n\nIf you\u2019re new to using DeepSeek-R1 models, go to the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Model access under Bedrock configurations in the left navigation pane. To access the fully managed DeepSeek-R1 model, request access for DeepSeek-R1 in DeepSeek. You\u2019ll then be granted access to the model in Amazon Bedrock.\n\nNext, to test the DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock, choose Chat/Text under Playgrounds in the left menu pane. Then choose Select model in the upper left, and select DeepSeek as the category and DeepSeek-R1 as the model. Then choose Apply.\n\nUsing the selected DeepSeek-R1 model, I run the following prompt example:\n\nA family has $5,000 to save for their vacation next year. They can place the money in a savings account earning 2% interest annually or in a certificate of deposit earning 4% interest annually but with no access to the funds until the vacation. If they need $1,000 for emergency expenses during the year, how should they divide their money between the two options to maximize their vacation fund?\n\nThis prompt requires a complex chain of thought and produces very precise reasoning results.\n\nTo learn more about usage recommendations for prompts, refer to the README of the DeepSeek-R1 model in its GitHub repository.\n\nBy choosing View API request, you can also access the model using code examples in the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDK. You can use us.deepseek.r1-v1:0 as the model ID.\n\nHere is a sample of the AWS CLI command:\n\naws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \\ --model-id us.deepseek-r1-v1:0 \\ --body \"{\\\"messages\\\":[{\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"[n\\\"}]}],max_tokens\\\":2000,\\\"temperature\\\":0.6,\\\"top_k\\\":250,\\\"top_p\\\":0.9,\\\"stop_sequences\\\":[\\\"\\\n\n\\\n\nHuman:\\\"]}\" \\ --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \\ --region us-west-2 \\ invoke-model-output.txt\n\nThe model supports both the InvokeModel and Converse API. The following Python code examples show how to send a text message to the DeepSeek-R1 model using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API for text generation.\n\nimport boto3 from botocore.exceptions import ClientError # Create a Bedrock Runtime client in the AWS Region you want to use. client = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", region_name=\"us-west-2\") # Set the model ID, e.g., DeepSeek-R1 Model. model_id = \"us.deepseek.r1-v1:0\" # Start a conversation with the user message. user_message = \"Describe the purpose of a 'hello world' program in one line.\" conversation = [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"text\": user_message}], } ] try: # Send the message to the model, using a basic inference configuration. response = client.converse( modelId=model_id, messages=conversation, inferenceConfig={\"maxTokens\": 2000, \"temperature\": 0.6, \"topP\": 0.9}, ) # Extract and print the response text. response_text = response[\"output\"][\"message\"][\"content\"][0][\"text\"] print(response_text) except (ClientError, Exception) as e: print(f\"ERROR: Can't invoke '{model_id}'. Reason: {e}\") exit(1)\n\nTo enable Amazon Bedrock Guardrails on the DeepSeek-R1 model, select Guardrails under Safeguards in the left navigation pane, and create a guardrail by configuring as many filters as you need. For example, if you filter for \u201cpolitics\u201d word, your guardrails will recognize this word in the prompt and show you the blocked message.\n\nYou can test the guardrail with different inputs to assess the guardrail\u2019s performance. You can refine the guardrail by setting denied topics, word filters, sensitive information filters, and blocked messaging until it matches your needs.\n\nTo learn more about Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, visit Stop harmful content in models using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in the AWS documentation or other deep dive blog posts about Amazon Bedrock Guardrails on the AWS Machine Learning Blog channel.\n\nHere\u2019s a demo walkthrough highlighting how you can take advantage of the fully managed DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock:\n\nNow available\n\nDeepSeek-R1 is now available fully managed in Amazon Bedrock in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) AWS Regions through cross-Region inference. Check the full Region list for future updates.

This facility, known as MT3, is only the second of its kind in Montana, and the ribbon-cutting ceremony highlighted the impact the center has already had on the local economy and community.\n\nWatch the full video of this story below:\n\nBillings celebrates ribbon cutting of new Amazon deliver station and dozens of new jobs\n\nAmazon\u2019s $23 million investment in the 40,000-square-foot building located at 6767 Tun Tavern Road, which opened in late October 2024, promises to add more than 100 jobs to the region. Since its opening, the facility has already employed around 80 people and provided work for over 90 drivers.\n\nRelated: Billings employees in state's second Amazon distribution center gear up for busy season\n\n\u201cWe are really proud of our investment here in the community,\" said Tareq Wafaie, the economic policy manager for Amazon in Montana. \u201cThat helps us be an active steward of the community by providing jobs, providing a good opportunity to help make our customers happy by substantially reducing delivery times.\u201d\n\nIsabel Spartz/MTN News The delivery station held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday for local community leaders.\n\nAlong with the ribbon-cutting, city leaders were offered a tour of the delivery facility and process. Packages from fulfillment centers are shipped in and sorted to be distributed to their destination within a 60-minute radius. The station will now make Amazon deliveries faster.\n\n\u201cThe packages usually arrive during the night or the day before, and then we start about 2:30 in the morning and then they're out the same day. So it's usually about 24 hours or so coming from the fulfillment center,\" said Gail Jones, the center's site lead.\n\nOver the past year, Amazon has brought nearly 300 jobs to the state and is expecting to continue expanding its workforce. The center\u2019s leaders are particularly focused on hiring additional staff in the coming weeks to meet the seasonal demand for Prime deliveries.\n\nIsabel Spartz/MTN News\n\n\u201cMany of our members and our associates are actually from here and have strong roots to the community and to the state, so we're just looking forward to connecting even more,\" said Jones. \u201cPrime (Day) will be coming up before too long and we will be hiring for that as well.\"\n\nErin and David Tiedeman are delivery service providers for the facility, meaning they run the small van service that delivers the packages and partner with Amazon. The couple, who work side-by-side, are pleased with the opportunities that Amazon\u2019s presence has brought to them.\n\n\u201cWe start the morning together and we finish at night together and I like it. I wouldn't change anything. I couldn't have a better partner,\" said the Tiedemans. \u201cFor us to get to partner with someone like Amazon is, I mean, how often you get that kind of opportunity to be (in your) hometown and get to do that with Amazon?\u201d\n\nThe service has 57 vans, with 43 usually running at one time. On Monday alone, they delivered 8,000 packages.\n\nIsabel Spartz/MTN News Erin and David Tiedeman.\n\n\u201cIt's an everyday job, but we're kind of getting to the point now where we've got a lot of people and got a lot of help,\" said David.\n\n\u201cPackages don't stop. We still load, we still deliver,\" added Erin. \"They can have up to 250 packages and it's in and out loading up and down, up and down every day, but it's a good workout.\"\n\nAs the facility settles into its operations, residents can look forward to faster deliveries and more local job opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe've had wonderful support from the community, and most of that comes because we are delivering packages and surprising and delighting our customers at a much faster rate,\" said Wafaie.",

NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC and NBC News.\n\nThe show pitted 16 contestants against one another for the chance to win a job working for Trump with a $250,000 salary. Hopefuls were dumped from the show each week with Trump\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nBurnett added that \u201cSurvivor\u201d found new fans thanks to audiences discovering it on streaming during the pandemic. \u201cOn Monday, March 10, this same phenomenon will begin again ... with \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut none of the stars of Burnett\u2019s other shows have the same retrospective importance as Trump, and both his critics and admirers will now be able to watch, some for the first time, the show that lifted his public profile long before his run for the White House in 2017.\n\nViewers will see Trump developing his skills in front of a camera, an ability he exploited on the campaign trail and in office to simply and effectively communicate with his audience.\n\nTrump explains in the first episode that he had gone bankrupt and fought his way back \u2014 a depiction of the personality that years later would come to dominate the Republican Party and win two terms in office.\n\nThe show\u2019s return may also pose questions for Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in January alongside other tech billionaires. Bezos attracted criticism for ending the tradition at The Washington Post, which he owns, of endorsing a presidential candidate.\n\nIn January, Amazon Prime Video licensed an upcoming documentary about first lady Melania Trump. At the time, Bezos did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was involved in securing the deal. Last month, Bezos\u2019 decision that the opinion section take a new direction and focus only on \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets, prompted criticism and caused the section\u2019s editor, David Shipley, to step down.",

In a video posted to Instagram, Schwarz said he personally has not bought anything from the company since the protest began.\n\n\"I'm just here to remind you to hold the line,\" Schwarz said in the Instagram Story. \"I have not done any Amazon shopping, obviously, I haven't watched anything (on Prime Video), my friends haven't, my family hasn't.\"\n\nSchwarz said he had received \"hundreds of messages\" from all over the world from people saying they had joined the protest and were not shopping with Amazon. The movement he created is called People's Union USA.\n\nThe weeklong avoidance of Amazon is \"not just a boycott,\" but rather a \"calculated strike,\" Schwarz wrote in a March 4 Instagram post.\n\n\"Any type of drop in sales would be a success to us,\" Schwarz told CNET in an email.\n\nHe called out Amazon's impact on small businesses, treatment of workers and record profits.\n\n\"This blackout is another massive message,\" he posted on Instagram.\n\nThe first major message from People's Union USA came on Feb. 28, with a 24-hour economic boycott aimed widely at big corporations. Schwarz encouraged followers to shop at small businesses instead. News of the effort spread over social media, with celebrities such as John Leguizamo, Bette Midler and Mark Ruffalo supporting the movement.\n\nThe group doesn't claim any political affiliation.\n\n\"We are not a political party. We are not a protest,\" Schwarz wrote on its website. \"We are a movement of people, organizing to take back control of our economy, government and future of our country.\"\n\nWhat an Amazon boycott could look like\n\nThe boycott also calls for avoiding Amazon-owned Whole Foods. Jessica Dolcourt/CNET\n\nSchwarz's vision for the next boycott means more than cutting out toilet paper deliveries or impulse kitchen gadget purchases from Amazon's main website. He wants consumers to avoid Prime Video, Whole Foods, Zappos, Twitch, Alexa, Audible, Ring and IMDb, all of which are owned by Amazon or a subsidiary.\n\nWith more than 100 subsidiaries, Amazon's tendrils run deep. It even has creative control over 007 superspy James Bond through its ownership of MGM Studios.\n\nFor someone tied into Amazon's ecosystem, this would mean unplugging Alexa devices, turning off Ring cameras and holding off on the third-season premiere of Wheel of Time. The fantasy series returns March 13.\n\nWill Amazon feel the boycott?\n\nThe Amazon boycott has a David and Goliath feel to it. The retail and entertainment juggernaut reported net sales of $638 billion in 2024. That was an 11% increase over 2023.\n\nSchwarz has 366,000 followers on Instagram and 341,000 followers on TikTok -- his main social media vehicles for getting the word out. Meanwhile, Amazon has hundreds of millions of customers worldwide.\n\nMomentum Commerce, a digital marketplace consulting and data services company, tracked hourly sales data from its client base during the Feb. 28 boycott. The company compared that data to average sales from the prior eight Fridays. Momentum's analysis showed Amazon sales were up 1% versus the average during the boycott.\n\n\"I'd say the minimal impact on Amazon sales during the one-day boycott isn't necessarily surprising,\" lead researcher Andrew Waber told CNET. Waber points out how Amazon exceeds $1 billion in sales every day. \"This size makes the retailer naturally resilient, particularly when it comes to short-term disruptions.\"\n\nMomentum Commerce will track sales data during the weeklong boycott to see if trends from the one-day event play out over the longer period.\n\nUp next: General Mills, Nestle, Target and Walmart\n\nThe Amazon boycott is just the beginning of a series of boycotts. The People's Union USA laid out a schedule for future boycotts, including:\n\nNestle (which owns brands including Carnation and Gerber) from March 21-28.\n\nWalmart from April 7-13.\n\nAnother wide-ranging economic boycott for the weekend of April 18.\n\nGeneral Mills (known for Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Pillsbury) from April 21-27.\n\nThose companies aren't the only subjects of boycott efforts. Atlanta, Georgia, pastor and activist Jamal Bryant is promoting a 40-day Target \"fast\" starting this week to protest the retailer's move away from diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nBoycotts are a way for consumers to call attention to concerns and find ways to align their spending with their political, economic and social goals. It may not hurt the bottom line of a company such as Amazon but the economic boycotts are certainly generating social-media-fueled discussions. If nothing else, it asks consumers to consider where they want their money to go.",

The series originally debuted on the streamer in November 2024. The show served as a TV update to the 1999 film of the same name, which was itself based on the classic novel \u201cDangerous Liaisons.\u201d\n\nA TV show based on the film was set up at IMDB TV (a.k.a Freevee) in 2021 before being formally ordered at Prime Video in late 2023.\n\nThe Amazon series starred Sarah Catherine Hook, Zac Burgess, Savannah Lee Smith, Sara Silva, John Harlan Kim, Khobe Clarke, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Brooke Lena Johnson.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSara Goodman and Phoebe Fisher served as co-showrunners, writers, and executive producers. Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film also executive produced along with Roger Kumble. Moritz produced the original film, which was written and directed by Kumble. Bruce Mellon along with Andrea Iervolino and Monika Bacardi of Iervolino & Bacardi Entertainment were producers. The series was produced by Sony Pictures Television, Amazon MGM Studios, and Original Film.\n\nPer the official description, the show \u201cfollows the elite students of Manchester College, a Washington, D.C.-adjacent university, where reputation means everything, fraternities and sororities are the gold standard, and two ruthless step-siblings, Caroline Merteuil (Hook) and Lucien Belmont (Burgess), will do anything to stay on top of the cutthroat social hierarchy. After a brutal hazing incident threatens the entire Greek Life system, they\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to preserve their power and reputation \u2013 even if that means seducing Annie Grover (Smith), the daughter of the Vice President of the United States. Hearts will be broken, loyalties will be tested, and secrets will be revealed in this modern-day royal court that is Manchester College.\u201d\n\nAmazon does not typically release viewership information regarding their shows, so it is difficult to gauge exactly how many people tuned in to \u201cCruel Intentions.\u201d However, the series failed to make an appearance on the Nielsen Top 10 Streaming charts and also failed to find much love with critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series held a 24% critical approval rating with 10 reviews counted.\n\nPrior to this version of the show, NBC ordered a pilot for a followup to the film in 2016 with Sarah Michelle Gellar, one of the film\u2019s original stars, attached to reprise her role as Kathryn Merteuil. However, it ultimately didn\u2019t make it to series. Prior to that, Fox\u2019s attempted a \u201cCruel Intentions\u201d prequel series, which was canceled before making it to air. Three episodes of that show were eventually assembled to become the direct-to-video film \u201cCruel Intentions 2\u201d in 2001. In 2004, Sony Pictures produced a second direct-to-video sequel, \u201cCruel Intentions 3.\u201d",

            "content": "The e-commerce giant's history demonstrates that the right idea, executed in the right way at the right time, can turn nothing into a big something.\n\nYou probably already know Amazon (AMZN 1.17%) has been one of the modern era's most rewarding investments. And rightfully so.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, founder Jeff Bezos spotted an underappreciated opportunity in the then-budding worldwide web, and acted on it. The rest, as they say, is history. The company's annual revenue has grown from less than $16 million back in 1996 to $638 billion last year.\n\nBut exactly how rewarding has its stock been? Only a relatable example can put things in their proper perspective. To this end, a $10,000 investment in Amazon stock back in early 2000 would be worth $627,000 at the time of this writing. That's nearly a 6,300% return on the position over the course of the 25 years in question.\n\nAmazon offers a unique opportunity\n\nThere's an important footnote to add to this big gain, however. That is, while Amazon became an enormous winner in a relatively short period of time, this isn't the norm. It's an exception to the norm.\n\nEven the strongest of young start-ups in the right place at the right time typically don't perform this well. Some of the technology companies that were touted just as well as Amazon was back in the 1990s, in fact, are no longer around today.\n\nThe key to Amazon's initial survival and eventual thriving is also worth highlighting. That's the fact that the company was plugged directly into the growth of what ended up serving as the basis of a sociocultural revolution: the internet. Although the worldwide web obviously can't be invented again, investors on the hunt for the \"next Amazon\" may want to keep their eyes peeled for something that's apt to be just as transformative (not unlike artificial intelligence, or AI).\n\nOf course, as was the case with Amazon back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the world's next game-changing industry won't be obvious in its infancy. You'll need to take something of a leap of faith if you're hoping to score a similar win. That's easier said than done.",

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\n\nWhen Amazon killed its TikTok-style feed, Inspire, last month, most advertisers were unsurprised. In their eyes, it just didn\u2019t seem to have gained any real interest.\n\n\u201cIt never really felt like it had enough traction, in terms of scale, to invest more than an initial test for many brands,\u201d said Joe O\u2019Connor, senior director of innovation and growth at Tinuiti. O\u2019Connor noted that his team didn\u2019t see much adoption from their clients, so they weren\u2019t shocked that Amazon sunsetted it.\n\nAnd while Amazon was nowhere near reliant on the video feed to generate any significant revenue, it\u2019s still a little surprising that even the biggest e-commerce player couldn\u2019t make social commerce work.\n\nSo what actually went wrong?\n\nGeorgi Todorov, founder of Create & Grow said that his team put a lot of money into Amazon\u2019s Inspire feed when it first came out in 2022, and created custom material for five online stores.\n\n\u201cDuring the first month, our client who sells home goods saw 31% more contact than with regular product listings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only 0.8% of those who were interested ended up buying something.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely that a big reason for this is people just weren\u2019t used to buying products from Amazon in this way. It\u2019s a totally different mindset than what most shoppers have when browsing on Amazon.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s foundation isn\u2019t wired for the impromptu, social serendipity that characterizes platforms made for scrolling and discovery,\u201d said Michelle Nguyen, marketing manager at UpPromote. \u201cWhich is why Amazon\u2019s Inspire feed ultimately failed \u2014 it was a mismatched fit from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the core issue around what typically makes these types of feeds work: influencers.\n\n\n\nTo ensure platforms have an endless stream of content, they need to encourage influencers to make that content. And it usually requires cash.\n\n\n\nTwo of the ad executives interviewed for this article confirmed that the creators they\u2019ve worked with felt the $25 payment per video on the Inspire feed was low compared to what they\u2019re typically rewarded with for their efforts elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe price was very low compared to what influencers can possibly make on other platforms with channel diversification,\u201d said Robert Kurtz, group vice president of search media solutions at Basis Technologies. \u201cFeedback I\u2019ve heard is that influencers/affiliate marketers made a lot more money doing affiliate sales on other platforms, while still generating affiliate commissions on Amazon sales.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Todorov agreed that from his team\u2019s experience, it felt like Amazon had no idea at all about how creator economics work.\n\n\u201cTheir [Amazon\u2019s] relationships team was looking for professional-quality videos and offered between $0.12 and $0.17 per click, with no minimums,\u201d he added. \u201cA lifestyle blogger [we work with] figured that she\u2019d need more than 50,000 views to make the same amount of money from a single paid Instagram post.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Inspire required a lot of time and effort for little in return for creators.\n\nThe situation for Amazon was made harder still because at the time of Inspire\u2019s launch, short-form video was on the rise, meaning Inspire had very little room to establish itself.\n\n\u201cTikTok and Instagram Reels are tough to compete with, especially with a younger audience,\u201d said Briana Cifelli, senior director of retail media at Jellyfish. \u201cThe concept of social commerce directly on Amazon was new, and it seems many consumers either weren\u2019t fully aware of it or didn\u2019t feel the need for another video shopping option.\u201d\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in the struggle to find success selling things through social platforms. Social commerce has been a tough nut to crack across the board. Back in September 2022, Digiday reported that Facebook, Instagram and even TikTok pulled back from social commerce in a bid to reset and revise their plans. Challenges at the time revolved around the lack of a seamless customer journey from discovery through paying through the apps, and the inability to change western consumer behavior quickly enough.\n\n\u201cThere are examples of highly successful social commerce platforms that have been running in China for many years,\u201d said Matt Voda, CEO of OptiMine Software. \u201cThey all have one key ingredient: frictionless payments that are seamlessly embedded into the experience. No platform in the U.S. has solved this missing piece of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nStill, while the payment side is very much a work in progress, TikTok has leaned into the blueprint of its Chinese counterpart, Douyin, with the launch of TikTok Shop in the U.S. in September 2023, having previously made it available in the U.K. and Southeast Asia.\n\n\u201cTikTok didn\u2019t start out as a place to shop; it started out as a place to have fun, and as people used it, commerce naturally grew out of their actions.\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cCommerce wasn\u2019t a forced addition; it became a natural part of the content experience.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is this: TikTok has created an ecosystem where commerce feels native to the user experience, while on the back end, creators can get paid reasonably for their efforts. Amazon\u2019s Inspire had neither of those things, which meant it was probably doomed from the start.\n\n\u201cAmazon is inherently not geared to social commerce \u2014 it\u2019s an e-commerce platform but it does not have the social fabric to support a social driven e-commerce play,\u201d said Lori Fields, founder, CEO and president of digital marketing agency Jay Street Partners. \u201cSocial commerce has to evolve from a platform that is first a social platform and secondarily e-commerce.\u201d\n\nResponding to this, an Amazon spokesperson said that Amazon regularly evaluates various features to better align with what customers tell them most, and as such, Inspire is no longer available.\n\n\n\n\u201cCustomers can continue to get inspiration across the Amazon store with Shop by Interest, the new Window Display on homepage, Creator storefronts, curated collections, and more. In addition to these features and our powerful search engine, we make it easy to find and discover products through our AI features such as visual search, AI Shopping Guides, and our shopping assistant, Rufus,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cBeyond Amazon, we know that customers look for inspiration and product recommendations in social feeds, and we\u2019re innovating to make shopping Amazon products more enjoyable through seamless social media integrations.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear from you.

            "content": "The Virginia Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that Amazon Flex drivers are employees and not independent contractors while criticizing the company for changing its arguments after it lost in prior decisions.\n\nAmazon Logistics failed to convince the high court that a ruling that one Flex driver is an employee should not apply to all of its Flex drivers despite originally arguing that the ruling should apply to all drivers.\n\nThe firm only reversed itself and argued to restrict the ruling after it lost several earlier rounds in its bid to have its drivers classified as independent contractors and avoid unemployment tax liability.\n\n\u201cAmazon Logistics wrongly asserts before us that it has always maintained one position throughout his litigation,\u201d the high court opinion declares. \u201cAmazon attempts to win this appeal by arguing against its original legal strategy\u2026, while claiming we should overlook its contradictions. Put more colloquially, Amazon now \u201czigs\u201d when it previously \u201czagged.\u201d This stratagem, therefore, fails\u2014as it must.\u201d\n\nAmazon Flex is an app-based program where participants sign up as a delivery driver for 3-to-4-hour time blocks. Drivers use their own means of transportation and the Amazon Flex app downloaded on their smartphones to deliver Amazon packages or Amazon-subsidiary groceries.\n\nThe case arose when a Flex driver sought unemployment benefits. Donald Diggs filed an unemployment-benefits claim and provided proof of income via 1099 forms issued by Amazon. The forms reflected that Amazon had not deducted taxes from the earnings. That triggered an examination by the Virginia Employment Commission over Amazon\u2019s tax liability and whether Amazon was required to report Diggs\u2019 earnings as wages.\n\nAfter an investigation, a commission tax representative issued a letter finding that Diggs and \u201csimilarly engaged\u201d Flex drivers were Amazon employees. Disagreeing and insisting that the driver was an independent contractor, Amazon requested a hearing. The evidence at the May 2020 hearing included an Amazon Flex contract, Amazon\u2019s liability questionnaire provided to the tax representative, the tax representative\u2019s determination letter, and the testimony of a senior manager at Amazon, Diggs and the tax representative. Amazon\u2019s senior manager testified that the terms of the Flex agreement and app-specific procedures applied equally to all Flex drivers. Diggs provided additional details on the performance review system and the training that new drivers receive.\n\nAs called for by Virginia law at the time, the hearing examiner applied the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s 20-factor test for determining whether an employer exercised \u201csufficient control over the individual\u201d for the individual to be classified as an employee. The hearing examiner concluded that Amazon exerted control \u201cover its Flex drivers\u201d and \u201cthe services provided by the claimant constitutes employment.\u201d The examiner further ordered Amazon to pay unemployment payroll taxes for \u201cother individuals who performed services as Flex drivers, and who were also misclassified as independent contractors rather than as employees.\u201d\n\nAmazon appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the commission\u2019s decision, and then Amazon appealed again. A unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed that Diggs was an Amazon employee and also that extending the decision to all Flex drivers was proper because \u201cthe terms and conditions\u201d of the Flex agreement \u201capply equally to all Flex drivers.\u201d\n\nAmazon then took its case to the state Supreme Court, arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the evidence relating to an individual claim supported a determination that all individuals in the Amazon Flex program are employees and not independent contractors.\n\nThe Supreme Court has rejected Amazon\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeals erred. Citing procedural rules that protect basic notions of fair play in the adversarial system, the high court found that the logistics firm\u2019s arguments on appeal were inconsistent with its arguments before the commission and lower courts.\n\nThe high court also found that Amazon\u2019s allegations against the commission in its appeal were unrelated to the claims of insufficient evidence. Rather, Amazon\u2019s brief alleged procedural concerns. Amazon complained that its due process rights were violated when the commission \u201cfailed to afford Amazon sufficient process to build a record beyond Mr. Diggs\u2019 unique circumstances,\u201d and \u201cdid nothing to correct Amazon\u2019s reasonable understanding that the proceeding was limited to Mr. Diggs,\u201d even though Amazon maintained all along that the case concerned the situation of all Flex drivers.\n\nThe high court said Amazon\u2019s arguments succumbed to the \u201cbroader and more demanding\u201d approbate-reprobate doctrine and are therefore waived. A litigant cannot \u201capprobate and reprobate by taking successive positions in the course of litigation that are either inconsistent with each other or mutually contradictory,\u201d or else such arguments are waived, the court explained.\n\nAmazon not only participated in the commission\u2019s process, but also affirmatively sought a class-wide ruling that all Flex drivers are independent contractors\u2014and argued that the evidence would support such a ruling. The commission agreed with Amazon\u2019s position that a class-wide ruling was appropriate, but found instead that all Flex drivers were employees.\n\n\u201cAfter losing before the commission, Amazon tried to retroactively pivot away from its strategy. Amazon now argues that the record is insufficient to support a ruling that applies to all Flex drivers and that it only ever sought a limited decision for a singular Flex driver, Diggs. Such a contradictory shift in position to mitigate self-inflicted wounds violates the approbate-reprobate doctrine,\u201d the court concluded\n\nThe court described how Amazon \u201cbelatedly attempted to repudiate\u201d its original position. Amazon never argued during the hearing that Diggs\u2019 contract terms differed from other Flex drivers. Instead, Amazon argued that the unsigned boilerplate contract was sufficient to show that all Flex drivers are independent contractors. Amazon even submitted that, if the commission decided that Diggs was an employee, only then is there \u201cno evidence\u201d to support a conclusion \u201cwith respect to all of the other delivery partners in Virginia.\u201d In other words, the court added, Amazon posited that all Flex drivers should only be bound by the decision that favors Amazon, otherwise the evidence should be discounted. Amazon now appeals because this \u201cone-sided conditionality\u201d was rejected.\n\nAt the Court of Appeals, Amazon also asserted a new argument\u2014that the decision must be vacated as to any Flex drivers who enrolled in the program after July 1, 2020, because the General Assembly amended the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d under state law to no longer include the IRS\u2019s 20-factor test. The Court of Appeals held that Amazon waived this argument by failing to fully develop it in its brief. The Supreme Court would not consider Amazon\u2019s argument regarding the change in statute because Amazon failed to address this issue in its assignment of error.\n\nHowever, the court added that nothing prevents Amazon or any other employer from pursuing a case based on a change in the law or different substantive terms of an employment agreement, either of which may lead to a different result. In fact, the court noted that the employment commission conceded that, should Amazon\u2019s circumstances materially change since the issuance of the decision\u2014for example, through either a change in the law or a change in the Flex contract\u2014Amazon may request a new hearing.\n\nTopics Personal Auto Virginia",

            "content": "Not that Amazon is in existential trouble, but it's difficult to dominate indefinitely. Eventually you just run out of opportunities to grow.\n\nThere's no denying it: Amazon (AMZN 1.17%) has been one of the market's most rewarding stocks of the modern era, gaining more than 270,000% since its initial public offering in 1997.\n\nIt's still going pretty strong, too, leveraging not just its dominance of an ever-growing e-commerce market but also its lead in a burgeoning cloud computing industry. This year's and next year's top lines are both expected to grow by about 10%, with earnings predicted to improve even faster.\n\nAs veteran investors can attest, however, nothing lasts forever. Yesterday's darlings can turn into tomorrow's disappointments, often weighed down by their sheer size resulting from years of unfettered growth. That certainly seems like a possibility in Amazon's case.\n\nTo this end, investors on the hunt for the proverbial \"next big thing\" may want to consider stepping into two other unstoppable growth stocks rather than Amazon.\n\nHere's a closer look at each one.\n\n1. Uber Technologies\n\nAnyone keeping tabs on Uber Technologies (UBER 0.78%) likely knows the ride-hailing giant's fourth-quarter numbers were a disappointment. Despite topping revenue estimates, operating income fell short of expectations.\n\nGuidance for the quarter now underway was also lackluster at a time when investors are increasingly concerned about the impact that robotaxis could soon have on its business. All told, Uber stock tumbled following the early February release of those numbers.\n\nBut there's a reason that the pullback quickly turned around to carry shares to highs above its pre-report price. This company is plugged into a movement that's much bigger than just one single quarter.\n\nIn short, automobile ownership (and even attaining a driver's license) is falling out of favor. Although a large number of people living where Uber does business will always want their own vehicle and need a driver's license to use it, both numbers are shrinking -- and are likely to continue declining.\n\nCar-sharing company Zipcar says roughly one-third of car-owning adults currently living in the United States are likely to no longer own one by 2030. Blame cost and inconvenience, mostly. It's now often cheaper and easier to just pay for a ride.\n\nAnd the Federal Highway Administration reports that less than 40% of U.S. teenagers now have a license, versus two-thirds of teens 30 years ago. For the same reason, too: It's now cheaper and easier to outsource mobility.\n\nAs this cohort of the population ages and has their own children, they're likely to pass along and even encourage continued growth of car-lessness and the continued demand for ride-hailing.\n\nThat's what Straits Research suggests with its industry outlook. It's predicting the ride-hailing market is set to grow at an annualized pace of more than 11% through 2032. Analysts expect Uber Technologies sales growth to outpace this number at least through 2027, underscoring its dominance of the U.S. sliver of the global ride-hailing business.\n\nBut what about the rise of robotaxis? It's something to watch to be sure.\n\nHowever, the technology for autonomous vehicles is still in its infancy. It could be years before it's a threat to Uber's business, and that assumes the company itself won't embrace the idea -- which it appears to be doing. Just this week, it announced that anyone hailing a ride in the Austin, Texas, area might be offered one using Alphabet's Waymo self-driving tech.\n\nIf autonomous driving is the future, Uber Technologies seems to be getting ready for it.\n\n2. SoFi Technologies\n\nThe other unstoppable stock to buy instead of Amazon is another consumer-facing name whose technology makes life easier. That's SoFi Technologies (SOFI 5.86%). It's an online bank, although that description doesn't do it justice; most major banks now offer at least some degree of online service.\n\nSoFi is different in that it was built from the ground up to be nothing but an online bank, yet it still offers all the services you would expect from a conventional brick-and-mortar bank, including checking accounts, investing services, loans, insurance, and credit cards.\n\nIt seems like a big leap for a business that for centuries has operated on an in-person basis. It's not quite as much of a leap as you might imagine, though.\n\nA survey performed last year by the American Bankers Association indicates that 55% of the nation's bank customers cited a mobile app as their first option for handling banking business. The next-nearest choice was an online interface (using a conventional computer's web browser), with 22% of respondents saying that was their go-to choice. In-branch visits and telephone calls, conversely, were preferred by only 8% and 4%, respectively, in the survey.\n\nSoFi Technologies is simply doing business where people are increasingly going. And it has the growth in customer head count to prove it.\n\nThe industry is almost certainly going to continue moving in this direction, if the age breakdown of the survey's respondents is any indication. Digitally native Gen Zers and millennials are more likely than average to use a mobile banking app, with 64% and 68% (respectively) of these two groups naming it as their first choice for banking.\n\nAs with car ownership and drivers' licenses, too, these cohorts are not only likely to pass along these new banking norms to younger generations, but also accelerate the shift away from brick-and-mortar banking.\n\nPerhaps the crux of the bullish argument here, however, is just how small SoFi Technologies is compared to the growth opportunity at hand.\n\nWith just about 10.1 million customers using a little less than 14.8 million of SoFi's products or services in total, the online bank has only scratched the surface of what it could become. For perspective, the United States is home to 340 million people, living in more than 127 million households. Even then, however, SoFi could continue to grow simply by selling its existing members more products and services than they currently use.\n\nAnd Straits Research expects the global online banking business to grow at an average pace of nearly 14% through 2030. The North American market where SoFi operates should remain its biggest region for this time frame.",

            "content": "Shailesh Chauhan shared strategies that helped him grow his career growth across Big Tech companies.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of learning to say no and resisting the urge to showcase your knowledge.\n\nOvercommunication is crucial in fast-paced environments to ensure alignment and clarity, he said.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shailesh Chauhan, a product manager at Meta in the Bay Area. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nI began my career in civil engineering in India and moved to the US for a master's in the same field. While studying at the University of Illinois in 2011, I realized that software was driving a big chunk of innovation, and I wanted a career in tech.\n\nI started taking coding classes and built my skills to the point I was hired as the first product manager at a small startup in the Bay Area. I spent five years at the analytics software startup and saw it grow from a company of 10 to one of over 1,000 employees.\n\nI left the startup in 2018 and joined Uber as a product manager the same year. Two years later, I moved to Amazon and worked as a product lead for Amazon Web Services. In 2022, I made a career switch to Meta, where I work as a machine learning product lead.\n\nFour strategies have helped me switch industries and scale my career:\n\n1. Learn to say no\n\nSaying no is extremely hard, especially as a junior employee. You tend to overwork yourself, which can be a risk to your reputation if you overpromise and then underdeliver because you took on too much.\n\nDenying some requests can earn you more respect from your managers. It demonstrates maturity and strategic thinking because you don't allow yourself or your team to spend time on any random thing thrown at you.\n\nI see it as my job to think about what are the biggest opportunities for me and what I want to say yes to. This allows me to carve out time for projects that are important and save my team's time.\n\nOne way to tackle this is by asking counterquestions about whether what your manager is asking will benefit the final product or the team. Another way is to list tasks you think are important and have high impact and ask your manager, \"Hey, I understand that this may be important, but how would you relatively think about it?\" Now, you can say no gracefully.\n\n2. Be the dumbest person in the room\n\nThis is a strategy I first learned at the startup I worked at, where I was surrounded by senior leaders from Google. I was the first person hired on the product team, and I felt pressure to project what I knew about our product. But I found it more valuable to listen carefully to get a full picture of the company and product so that I don't fight over things I don't really believe in.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSince then, I have found it valuable to play the \"dumb card\" and ask as many questions as possible, focusing on questions that uncover insights for other people. It is tempting to show that you are knowledgeable and that you have experience, but that should come from your work, not your words.\n\nEarly in your career, being quiet can be hard because you feel the need to fill any silent moments in meetings and one-on-ones. It's OK to embrace the silence instead of saying something redundant. Listening intently helps you bring in fresh ideas, which helps you prioritize your long-term career development over the short-term wins at that meeting.\n\n3. Focus on relationships beyond work\n\nI focus on building personal relationships with the people I work with because good relations go beyond company and country boundaries. Also, I do my best work when I am surrounded by people I trust and enjoy working with.\n\nI ask myself whether someone I am working with would want to work with me when they leave the company. If the answer is no, I try to work on that relationship so that it lasts beyond our day-to-day work.\n\n4. Overcommunication is key\n\nSometimes, people feel that they should not repeat themselves after making a point. But I think overcommunication is a feature and not a bug, especially in fast-paced environments where there are so many people and priorities, all working across multiple time zones.\n\nSo even when I feel like I risk sounding redundant, I choose to repeat myself because there are always one or two people who miss a message you send. I utilize different channels and make sure that everybody understands me and is on the same page.",

It gives me way more length and volume than other brands, slides on so much more easily, stays put ALL day, and never, ever smudges. My favorite part, though, is how gently and easily it comes off with soap and water. In the past, other mascara removals have felt rough on my lashes, but this comes off so fast that I'm like ??? was I even wearing mascara a minute ago??

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible though \u2014 tiny houses have recently offered an alternative route to home ownership.\n\nWe\u2019ve spotted numerous tiny homes at Amazon\u2019s outdoor store, including two-story cabins for cozy camping vibes, and this luxury villa-inspired tiny house that has two bedrooms, a full kitchen, a bathroom, a living room, and a front deck. You can fully personalize it to fit your needs, whether that\u2019s adding another bedroom (or two), or changing the exterior color. And did we mention it\u2019s available for less than $10,000?\n\nRead on to learn everything you need to know about what makes this Amazon tiny house so special you\u2019ll want it as a guest house, a rental unit, or your primary residence.\n\nPrefab 2-bedroom Modern Luxury Villa Tiny Home\n\nAmazon\n\nThe tiny home\u2019s design takes inspiration from luxury villas, using a wood-patterned exterior that gives off cozy vibes, and an asymmetrical roof with a modern aesthetic. As a container house, it\u2019s an easy build: Just unfold the walls and roof, and secure everything into place. The interior measures 380 square feet and, as we mentioned, includes two bedrooms, a full bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room to decorate to your liking. It also comes with a front deck for that coveted indoor-outdoor living \u2014 just imagine sitting outside with your cup of coffee every morning.\n\nWhat\u2019s most notable about the design is the fact that you can customize everything, including if you want to expand the size up to 791 square feet. You can also add bedrooms, for a total of up to four, which lets you sleep up to eight people without breaking out the air mattresses.\n\nBeyond the inside of the home, you even have the power to decide what shape of roof you\u2019d like \u2014 you can go with a clean, utilitarian design, or opt for a more modern look with asymmetrical edges. And, if you want to drench the house in natural light, Monica Guo, senior business manager for the brand, says you can even include floor-to-ceiling windows. Simply contact the brand through WhatsApp before purchasing, and they\u2019ll make note of your specifications and upgrades.\n\nAmazon\n\nCustomizations can go beyond the picture you see above, too, according to Guo. You can make a one-of-a-kind design to fit your needs, including transforming it into a two-story home for some added privacy \u2014 especially if you want extra space for hosting parties. Guo added that you can change the exterior color of the tiny home for no additional cost, that way you can give the house your own touch of curb appeal.\n\nAll the windows and doors come pre-insulated to save you the work from having to do it yourself. You don\u2019t even have to worry about building cabinets in the kitchen \u2014 it\u2019s all included \u2014 and, there\u2019s no need to whip out a toolbox in the bathroom either, as it\u2019s pre-installed with a toilet, full-size shower, and sink. As an added bonus, circuit sockets and water pipes are also included, making it move-in ready from the moment you unfold it.\n\nThat being said, other upgrades do come at a cost. The price will vary based on the size of the tiny home and additions you choose for the space. A 380-square-foot tiny house starts at $4,800. Outdoor additions like a terrace are around $1,000 extra.

You can use it in different time intervals ranging from 15 to 30 minutes. Amazon says it's 26% off but per our trackers,the savings are more like 15% which drops this baby to under $100!

Grab this while the price is so good.\n\nPromising review: \"Lately, I've been hearing alot about red light therapy, so I decided to do some research and what I've found is that the benefits of this are as follows; it increases circulation, decreases inflammation, helps with acne, reduces wrinkles, and helps with hyperpigmentation. I like to use a tanning bed ( I know, I know shame on me ) and with using a tanning bed that opens up the window for wrinkles, something I don't care for but I also don't care to stop using the tanning bed. This is very simple to use, and it's very comfortable to wear. You're able to use red light therapy every day which is a plus, and this comes with a USB charger so you dont have to worry about changing batteries, just charging them. It's good quality, and you are definitely getting your moneys worth. I highly recommend this if you're looking to give yourself healthier skin.\" \u2014 Shayla Emerick\n\n\"Since I started using facial red light therapy, my skin has become noticeably smoother and more refined. The deep penetration of the red light boosts collagen production, which has helped to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I use it daily and the results are so noticeable that my friends have complimented me on how much better my skin has become.\" \u2014 Wilgtte Dagh",

Amazon sells products in pretty much every category, so no matter what you're looking for, you can probably get it on Amazon. Better yet, the retailer offers new deals every day so there's a good chance you can save on your next purchase, especially if you use these money-saving tips.

These include Prime Day in July, Prime Big Deal Days in October and Black Friday/Cyber Monday in November. How do I know if an Amazon deal is legitimate? Some Amazon deals may seem too good to be true, and unfortunately, sometimes that is the case. One of the best ways to vet these offers and avoid getting scammed is by checking the seller information, which can be found on the product page just below the \"Buy Now\" button. It's a safe bet if the product is being sold and shipped by Amazon or the original manufacturer, but you should exercise caution if it's a third-party vendor. Not all third-party sellers are untrustworthy, but it's definitely worth checking the reviews to see other customers' experiences. How do I find the best offers at Amazon? Amazon offers so many deals that finding the true bargains takes a little legwork. One of the best ways to start cutting through the clutter is by heading to the and filtering it by trending or lightning deals, which will show you some of the most popular offers at the moment. Another good way to filter out some of the junk offers is by adding a minimum price and discount to your search. It's also very important to look beyond just the listed discount, as many products also feature on-page coupons that can be redeemed for additional savings. Amazon Prime members also get access to some exclusive offers.\n\nRead more: Take Advantage of Amazon Discounts Year Round With This Trick",

            "content": "Download this video to share it with your friends and family.\n\nThis International Women\u2019s Month, we honor the Indigenous women championing their people, culture, and land.\n\nThroughout the Amazon, Indigenous women are leading fights against extractive industries attempting to exploit their territory while also maintaining the struggle to protect future generations from the colonial disruption of their cultural practices. Indigenous women are not only protectors of the land but also keepers of ancestral knowledge, ensuring the survival of their culture, their people, and the Amazon.\n\nThe Chapra Nation are an Indigenous people who have lived in reciprocal relationship with the land in the Peruvian Amazon for over 7,000 years. Colonialism deliberately targeted and destabilized the leadership structures of the Chapra people, who traditionally honored women\u2019s central roles in addressing social and cultural issues within their community.\n\nYet, Chapra women have continued to resist this erasure. In the past decade, several strong women have reclaimed their community leadership roles. One of them is Olivia Bisa Tirko, the first woman President of the Autonomous Territorial Government of the Chapra Nation in the Peruvian Amazon. Olivia\u2019s leadership has broken barriers in the governance of the Chapra people, inspiring women and youth to feel pride in their Chapra identity and stand up to predatory oil companies.\n\nYour vote = a donation to Amazon Watch! Amazon Watch is one of CREDO Mobile\u2019s March grantees, which means supporters like you get to decide how their generous funds will be donated at the end of the month. That\u2019s right: you vote, they donate, and it only takes a few clicks! \u2611 VOTE FOR INDIGENOUS RIGHTS AND THRIVING RAINFORESTS!\n\nFor decades, the Chapra Nation has endured and resisted the plunder and environmental destruction of their ancestral homeland. Most recently, on October 3, the North Peruvian Pipeline, which is run by the state-run oil company Petroper\u00fa, leaked at least 1,500 gallons of oil into the Amazon, devastating the Pastaza River and severely impacting 17 surrounding Indigenous communities, including the Chapra Nation, by jeopardizing access to food and water. Their deep connection to the land was disrupted, impacting their ability to sustain themselves and consequently, protect the Amazon.\n\n\u201cIndigenous peoples represent a hope for all life, because if the Amazon has remained intact until now, it is thanks to those who live there, protecting it and resisting (extractivism). If Indigenous peoples disappear, the Amazon disappears,\u201d Olivia reminds us.\n\nExtractive industries threaten not only the land and its defenders but also the very existence of the Chapra Nation, committing what Olivia describes as cultural genocide. Women serve a critical role as cultural keepers in the Chapra Nation, passing on their deep ancestral knowledge to their children to preserve their traditional ways of life and stewardship of their homeland. As a leader, she is revitalizing how her people understand women\u2019s role in their community, highlighting their valuable contributions and challenging patriarchal colonial structures.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to acknowledge that behind a good leader, a fighter with vast knowledge, there is a mother with her ancestral wisdom, with her knowledge that has raised and shaped that child.\u201d\n\nBy highlighting the importance of women\u2019s leadership and the passing of ancestral knowledge to future generations, Olivia is ensuring the survival of her people and the protection of the Amazon.\n\nWe continue to stand in unwavering solidarity with women defenders like Olivia by amplifying their leadership in the climate justice movement and mobilizing solidarity funding through our Amazon Defenders Fund.\n\nJoin Olivia and other Indigenous women fighting for their land and future. Share her story and stand in solidarity with their resistance.\n\nPLEASE SHARE",

It exploits its workers. It fights against unions while raking in billions. It could make a positive difference in the world, but it chooses not to.\u201d\n\nSchwarz is leveraging the attention from the wider \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d on February 28. He told CNN in an interview last week that he hadn\u2019t expect much traction for his post, which was viewed millions of times. Celebrities like Stephen King and Bette Midler encouraged participation, and reporters wrote and aired TV pieces about it.\n\nOn The People\u2019s Union USA\u2019s website, Schwarz calls the group \u201ca grassroots movement dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform,\u201d adding that the \u201cgoal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.\u201d\n\nBlackout\u2019s impact\n\nSchwarz\u2019s boycott call last week gained strength online because it has captured the visceral public anger with the American economy, corporations and politics.\n\nStill, the \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d effort is relatively uncoordinated and nebulous. Experts on consumer boycotts and corporate strategy are dubious that it will make a dent in the bottom lines of the massive companies that it targets, let alone the vast US economy.\n\nLast week\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t make much of an impact to those corporations\u2019 bottom lines, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that uses phone location data to track store visits.\n\nThe firm said that \u201cmany retailers experienced year-over-year declines in weekly visits throughout February 2025,\u201d but attributed this to \u201cpost-holiday spending pullbacks, decreased consumer confidence, economic and tariff uncertainty, and unseasonably cold weather\u201d\n\nAs a result, Placer.ai said, the February 28 event\u2019s \u201cspecific impact is difficult to isolate, as most retailers saw year-over-year declines in line with recent weekly trends.\u201d\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.",

A Walmart spending blackout will take place April 7\u201313.\n\nThe Amazon boycott is about \u201csending a message loud enough to shake up the system,\" The People's Union USA's founder, John Schwarz, said Thursday on his Instagram account.\n\nAmazon spending freeze extends to companies it owns\n\nThe Amazon blackout goes beyond not buying directly from the Amazon website. It extends to avoiding watching Prime Video, buying groceries at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods, purchasing Ring equipment and visiting Amazon-owned businesses and websites such as IMDb, Goodreads, Woot and Zappos.\n\nWhy is there a boycott of Target, Amazon and other major retailers?\n\nThe People's Union USA, a grassroots organization that has been working since 2020 to promote economic resistance and improve government accountability and corporate practices, organized and promoted the day-long spending freeze. The boycott hopes to target major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy.\n\nThe move for boycotts comes after several major corporations rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion policies amid President Donald Trump's call to end federal DEI programs and threaten tariffs on international imports.\n\nThe organization created three 24-hour spending blackout days as well as upcoming week-long boycotts on Nestle, Walmart, General Mills and Amazon again.\n\nBoycotts planned against Walmart, Nestle and more\n\nAfter the Target and Amazon boycotts and the Feb. 28 no-spend day, here are some of the upcoming boycotts in the next few months:\n\nNestle : March 21-28\n\n: March 21-28 Walmart : April 7-14 and May 20-26\n\n: April 7-14 and May 20-26 Second economic blackout : April 18\n\n: April 18 General Mills : April 21-28\n\n: April 21-28 Amazon : May 6-12\n\n: May 6-12 Target : June 3-9\n\n: June 3-9 McDonald's : June 24-30\n\n: June 24-30 Independence Day boycott: July 4\n\nHow to participate in the boycotts\n\nDuring the week-long boycott of Amazon, all Amazon purchases should be completely avoided.\n\nFurthermore, the organization plans more no-spend days in the coming weeks. On no-spend days, economic blackout participants refrain from making in-store and online purchases from major retailers, restaurants, large banks, fast food companies, and gas stations. Participants are also encouraged to avoid using credit or debit cards.\n\nThe boycott targets non-essential spending. However, spending on essential goods, such as food, medicine, bills, and emergency supplies, is allowed during the blackout.\n\nThe People's Union says to only shop local small businesses during that time, if necessary.\n\nWhen are the next no-spend days?\n\nFuture no-spend days are planned for Friday, March 28, and Friday, April 18.",

Maybe you want to branch out from the Kindle store and try out other ebook distributors. Maybe you don\u2019t own many Amazon products, so the whole \u201cAmazon ecosystem\u201d thing isn\u2019t that useful to you.\n\nWhatever the reason, there are plenty of excellent alternatives to the Amazon Kindle. We\u2019ve tested a few, and share our recommended picks below.\n\nSKIP AHEAD How we picked the best Amazon Kindle alternatives | How to shop for Amazon Kindle alternatives | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nHow we picked the best Amazon Kindle alternatives\n\nTo pick the best Amazon Kindle alternatives, we tried models from brands like Kobo and Boox, and kept the following criteria in mind when using them:\n\nCompatibility: One of the main reasons to get a non-Kindle device is access to non-Kindle storefronts. Our top picks can purchase and read content from multiple storefronts, in multiple file formats.\n\nOne of the main reasons to get a non-Kindle device is access to non-Kindle storefronts.

Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best Amazon Kindle alternatives in 2025\n\nMany of our top picks came from Rakuten Kobo, an Amazon Kindle competitor, with other options coming from brands like Boox and Apple. Below each recommendation we share specifications we think you should know when shopping.\n\nBest overall: Rakuten Kobo Clara BW\n\nIf you are looking for a low-cost e-reader this is the one to get. It\u2019s Kobo\u2019s lowest-priced e-reader and is very similar to a kindle, with a glare-free black and white screen design that\u2019s perfect for reading text.\n\nYou can purchase books directly from the Rakuten Kobo store, rent books from your local library with the built-in Libby/Overdrive app or read ebooks you\u2019ve purchased from other stores. The device is compact and lightweight, and is IPX8 waterproof \u2014 well-suited to travel.\n\nYou can also get it in a colour version, the Kobo Clara Colour, but that version is a little pricier.\n\nScreen: 6-in. black & white touchscreen | Battery: up to 53 days | Weight: 174g | Storage: 16GB\n\nBest color: Rakuten Kobo Libra Colour\n\nRakuten Kobo Libra Colour $ 229.99 Kobo Books What we like Color display\n\nButtons for page-turning\n\nIPX8 waterproof Something to note Color is less vibrant\n\nNBC Select contributing writer Maria Cassano tested this color e-reader for a few weeks after the brand sent her one to try out \u2014 she recommends it to any avid reader. It\u2019s easy to read books from the Kobo store and the public library, plus you can read online articles by syncing the device with the Pocket app.\n\nBut the color touchscreen, page-turning buttons and note-taking stylus (sold separately) are what really solidified this e-reader as one of Cassano\u2019s favorites. You can read more in her Kobo Libra Colour review.\n\nScreen: 7-in. color touchscreen | Battery: up to 40 days | Weight: 199.5g | Storage: 32GB\n\nNBC Select commerce editor Jordan Bowman has been testing the Boox Palma 2 for over three weeks \u2014 it\u2019s now his go-to device for reading any and everything.\n\nI say everything because, unlike our recommendations from Kobo, the Boox Palma 2 is not strictly an e-reader \u2014 it\u2019s actually a stripped-down Android phone with an e-reader-style black and white display. That means you can do anything you would normally do on your phone (TikTok included), but the slow screen lends itself most to reading.\n\nIt is compact and pocketable, much more than our other recommendations. Bowman uses it to read articles online and on apps like Libby, Shonen Jump and more. \u201cThe written word is your oyster when it comes to the Palma 2,\u201d says Bowman.\n\nScreen: 6.13-in. black & white touchscreen | Battery: unlisted (users report up to a 5 days) | Weight: 170g | Storage: 128GB\n\nBest public library: Libby\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned Libby multiple times already: it\u2019s a free public library app that makes it easy to rent ebooks (and audiobooks) from your local library\u2019s catalog. I\u2019ve used it for over five years to read books on my phone, tablet or e-reader \u2014 it\u2019s available on every device we recommend here. All you have to do is sign in with your library card, then you can search your library\u2019s collection, place holds, checkout titles and send them to your device(s). It\u2019s my favorite way to discover new books and audiobooks.\n\nBest for note taking: Rakuten Kobo Elipsa 2E\n\nThis is Kobo\u2019s best e-reader for note-taking. It comes with the Kobo Stylus 2, which has a convenient built-in highlighter button and eraser cap. You can use the stylus to write and annotate any ebook or document you have on the device. It\u2019s also easy to import and export files to your Dropbox or Google Drive account. Plus, the larger 10-inch screen is much more comfortable to write on than the brand\u2019s smaller devices.\n\nOutside of note-taking, the Elipsa 2E works similarly to the other Kobo e-readers on this list \u2014 you can read all kinds of ebooks and also listen to audiobooks by pairing any wireless earbuds.\n\nScreen: 10.3-in. black & white touchscreen | Battery: unspecified number of weeks | Weight: 390g | Storage: 32GB\n\nBest for comics and graphic novels: Apple iPad (10th Gen)\n\nI use an iPad and the Libby app anytime I want to read a graphic novel or comic book. I linked the lowest-priced iPad, the iPad 10th generation, above, but really any iPad can handle comics and graphic novels \u2014 I personally use an older iPad Air (4th Generation) for this kind of reading.\n\nWhile e-readers like the Kobo Libra Colour have color displays, none can match the vivid, colorful screen of an iPad. And for graphic novels and comics, where half the fun is enjoying the artistry and detail in each illustration, a high-resolution screen is a must, in my experience.\n\nThe downside is battery life: this iPad 10th generation has up to 10 hours of battery life \u2014 that\u2019s nothing compared to the days or even weeks of our other picks.\n\nScreen: 10.9-in. color touchscreen | Battery: up to 10 hours | Weight: 477g | Storage: 64GB\n\nHow to shop for Kindle alternatives\n\nRegardless of the type of e-reader you are shopping for, there are a few things to keep in mind as you shop.\n\nWhere (and what) you can read\n\nE-readers from brands like Amazon and Kobo are mostly restricted to a single bookstore: the Kindle store or the Kobo store respectively. While both brands also support alternatives like the Libby app, these traditional e-readers are more limited than devices like the Boox Palma or Apple iPad.\n\nIf you are looking to read any and everything: news articles, library books, comic books or internet PDFs, a device that runs Android or Apple software may be more flexible than a traditional ereader. But if you are an ebook purist, traditional e-readers have the simplest interface and longest battery life.\n\nScreen size and resolution\n\nA big, colorful screen is best, right? Not always. How sharp and crisp text and imagery appears on your screen depends on a few things: screen size, brightness, resolution and pixels-per-inch (PPI) to name a few. If you are just reading ebooks, a simple e-reader like the Rakuten Kobo Clara BW is more than enough. But if you really want colorful comic book pages to pop, something like a tablet will render each page with more detail and resolution than a color e-reader display.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness including recent stories on TVs, running shoes, streaming devices and more.

            "content": "Fraud detection is a critical challenge for call centers, they need to provide a seamless customer experience while protecting the organization from fraudulent activities. Traditionally, call centers have relied on agents to manually screen calls, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, companies might force customers to authenticate themselves every time they call, leading to a poor user experience. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful solution that can help organization reach a harmonious balance between these approaches, enabling efficient and accurate fraud detection without compromising the customer experience.\n\nThis blog post will show you how to use the power of ML to build a fraud-detection model using Amazon SageMaker Canvas, a no-code/low-code ML service that business analysts and domain experts can use to build, train, and deploy ML models without requiring extensive ML expertise.\n\nBackground\n\nIn this solution, you will use a contact trace record (CTR) dataset from Amazon Connect. The solution works with data from other inbound telephony services provided they contain call specific metadata. Importantly, each call has been previously labeled based on past fraud detection efforts by the call center.\n\nTo start, you will enrich the raw CTR data using the phone number validation service from Amazon Pinpoint. Then, you will prepare the data using Amazon SageMaker notebooks and train a fraud detection model using SageMaker Canvas. Finally, to understand how to provide a scalable and cost-effective solution, you will explore how to deploy the model to a Sagemaker endpoint and right-size through autoscaling in a managed, serverless environment.\n\nThe following figure shows the architecture with the complete process including data enrichment, merging, cleanup, and model training and deployment. Throughout this blogpost we will reference the key parts as we implement them.\n\nData enrichment and preparation\n\nEach CTR contains information about an incoming call such as agent, connection attempts, and channel. Before proceeding, you must transform the data into a tabular form (CSV, Parquet, or tables), which are the supported formats in SageMaker Canvas.\n\nThe raw CTR dataset doesn\u2019t contain enough information to effectively train an ML model. You will enrich it using the Amazon Pinpoint validate API, which provides additional fields such as carrier, location data, and phone type. After you have the enriched dataset, you can use a SageMaker notebook to clean and prepare the data for training.\n\nEnriching the data with Amazon Pinpoint validate API\n\nAmazon Pinpoint includes a phone number validation service that you can use to determine if a phone number is valid and to obtain additional contact information. For example, the API response for a valid mobile phone number would look like the following:\n\n{ \"NumberValidateResponse\": { \"Carrier\": \"ExampleCorp Mobile\", \"City\": \"Seattle\", \"CleansedPhoneNumberE164\": \"+12065550142\", \"CleansedPhoneNumberNational\": \"2065550142\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"CountryCodeIso2\": \"US\", \"CountryCodeNumeric\": \"1\", \"OriginalPhoneNumber\": \"+12065550142\", \"PhoneType\": \"MOBILE\", \"PhoneTypeCode\": 0, \"Timezone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\", \"ZipCode\": \"98101\" } }\n\nWhile the response for an invalid phone number would contain the following:\n\n{ \"NumberValidateResponse\": { \"CleansedPhoneNumberE164\": \"+44163296076\", \"CleansedPhoneNumberNational\": \"163296076\", \"Country\": \"United Kingdom\", \"CountryCodeIso2\": \"GB\", \"CountryCodeNumeric\": \"44\", \"OriginalPhoneNumber\": \"+440163296076\", \"PhoneType\": \"INVALID\", \"PhoneTypeCode\": 3 } }\n\nThere are multiple ways to enrich your dataset with this API. The response from the validate API call is a JSON document that contains all the fields. You will need to convert them to the appropriate format and merge them with the original CTR dataset. This will give you an enriched dataset that includes all the fields from the CTR and their corresponding validate results. The goal is to extract the caller phone number from each row in the dataset ( CustomerEndpoint in Connect) and run it against the Amazon Pinpoint validate API.\n\nThe following figure shows an example architecture used to enrich with Amazon Pinpoint, cache in Amazon DynamoDB, and merge the datasets with Lambda functions. The DynamoDB cache saves the responses from Pinpoint by input key so that you don\u2019t have to re-validate phone numbers.\n\nData engineering and data preparation\n\nThe first step is to clean up the data by discarding fields that aren\u2019t adding any predictive value. This will make the training process faster and the model more accurate. For example, in the CTR data, the AWSAccountId field will be the same for all records, and the ContactId field will be unique, so you can discard them both. The goal is to simplify the dataset as much as possible using SageMaker Canvas to perform multiple experiments to better understand which fields in the data have the biggest impact on the prediction.\n\nAfter you have reduced the dataset, you can select a random, smaller subset of data (for example, 1,000 records) and build a model in SageMaker Canvas. SageMaker Canvas provides a visual interface that you can use to rapidly build, train, and deploy ML models without the need for extensive coding.\n\nTo begin the training process, you will first import the prepared, enriched data file containing the CTR data into SageMaker Canvas. SageMaker Canvas will automatically detect the data format and structure, allowing you to preview the dataset and make any necessary adjustments before proceeding.\n\nAfter the dataset is ready, you can select the fraud label as your target variable and configure the model training parameters. SageMaker Canvas will handle the underlying ML algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, streamlining the model development process.\n\nAfter the model is trained, SageMaker Canvas will show an analysis of the fields and their weights. In addition to the build step\u2014where you can drop and transform your imported dataset\u2014SageMaker Canvas also includes Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, which you can use to prepare, featurize, and analyze your data. This allows you to do additional transformations as you experiment and iterate. You should continue to run these small experiments while making changes to the training dataset with the goal of getting the best performance from your model, while reducing the training time and the latency in inference.\n\nAfter experimenting, you will identify the most important features and how you want to transform your data. When you\u2019re confident in your model\u2019s performance, you can decide how to deploy the trained model.\n\nFinal model deployment and right-sizing\n\nOnce your model is trained, you will need to deploy an endpoint so that you can invoke your model and consume the results via API. For example, the diagram below shows a Lambda Function calling the deployed endpoint. We continue to use the DynamoDB table as a cache. This way we avoid reprocessing numbers.\n\nSageMaker Canvas offers a default deployment option where you can choose the instance type and number of instances to host the trained model that will meet your scaling needs. To help ensure that these instances aren\u2019t over- or under-provisioned, SageMaker provides multiple features to help you optimize your deployment to your specific needs.\n\nAutoscaling : Autoscaling dynamically adjusts the number of instances provisioned for a model in response to workload changes. The steps to make this change are described in detail in Configure model autoscaling. SageMaker recently introduced Scale Down to Zero for AI inference, which allows endpoints to scale to zero instances during periods of inactivity and can help customers save costs.\n\n: Autoscaling dynamically adjusts the number of instances provisioned for a model in response to workload changes.

Serverless deployment: Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built inference option that you can use to deploy and scale ML models without configuring or managing any of the underlying infrastructure. Compute resources scale automatically depending on traffic, eliminating the need to choose instance types or manage scaling policies. To learn more, see Serverless endpoint operations.\n\nTo have use a serverless deployment and obtain inference recommendations, a single-container model is needed. This is currently not possible when using SageMaker Data Wrangler, because it generates two containers following data transformation: one for data preprocessing and one for model prediction.\n\nAfter preparing the final dataset, you can bring it into SageMaker Canvas to train the detection model. Follow the same steps as you did with the smaller tests, making sure that you don\u2019t use any of the data transformation options within SageMaker Canvas.\n\nDepending on the size and complexity of the final dataset, the training process can take several hours to complete. After the training is complete, SageMaker Canvas will generate a trained model that you can immediately deploy to an endpoint.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy using the power of Amazon SageMaker Canvas, you can build, train, and deploy a robust fraud detection model, empowering your call center to deliver exceptional customer experiences while safeguarding your business and allowing your human agents to focus on legitimate customers.\n\nYou can begin testing SageMaker Canvas using the AWS Management Console today or learn more about SageMaker Canvas basics at the SageMaker Canvas Immersion Day workshop.\n\nAbout the authors",

            "content": "Since 2016, game developers have been using Amazon GameLift to power games with dedicated, scalable server hosting capable of supporting 100M concurrent users (CCU) in a single game. Responding to customer requests for additional managed compute capabilities beyond game servers, we\u2019re announcing Amazon GameLift Streams \u2014 a new capability in Amazon GameLift to help game publishers build and deliver global, direct-to-player game streaming experiences. As part of this announcement, existing capabilities in Amazon GameLift are now known as Amazon Gamelift Servers, continuing to serve hundreds of developers including industry leaders Ubisoft, Zynga, WB Games, and Meta.\n\nAmazon GameLift Streams helps you deliver game streaming experiences at up to 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second across devices including iOS, Android, and PCs. In just a few clicks, you can deploy games built with a variety of 3D engines, without modifications, onto fully-managed cloud-based GPU instances and stream games through the AWS Network Backbone directly to any device with a web browser.\n\nAmazon GameLift Streams helps you distribute your games direct-to-players, without having to invest millions of dollars in infrastructure and software development to build your own service. Players can start gaming in just a few seconds, without waiting for downloads or installs.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at Amazon GameLift Streams:\n\nYou can use the Amazon GameLift Streams SDK to integrate with your existing identity services, storefronts, game launchers, websites, or newly created experiences such as playable demos, and begin streaming to players. You can monitor active streams and usage from within the AWS console, and seamlessly scale your streaming infrastructure across multiple regions on the AWS global network to reach more players around the world with low-latency gameplay. Amazon GameLift Streams is the only solution that enables you to upload your game content onto fully-managed GPU instances in the cloud and start streaming in minutes, with little or no modification of your code.\n\nPlayers can access AAA, AA, and indie games on PCs, phones, tablets, smart TVs, or any device with a WebRTC-enabled browser. Amazon GameLift Streams allows you to dynamically scale streaming capacity to match player demand, ensuring you only pay for what you need. You can choose from a selection of GPU instances that offer a range of price performance, and rely on the built-in security of AWS to protect your intellectual property.\n\nLet\u2019s get started\n\nTo begin using Amazon GameLift Streams, I need an existing Amazon GameLift Streams implementation. I prepare my game files by following the Amazon GameLift Streams documentation.\n\nThen, I\u2019ll upload my files to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). I can use the AWS Management Console or this AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command to upload my game files:\n\naws s3 sync my-game-folder s3://my-bucket/my-game-path\n\nThe next step is to create an Amazon GameLift Streams application. I navigate to the Amazon GameLift Streams console. This is how the new AWS GameLift Streams console looks:\n\nOn the Amazon GameLift Streams console, I choose Create application.\n\nIn the Runtime settings, I select the runtime environment for my game application.\n\nThen, I need to select my S3 bucket and folder from the previous step, then set the path to my game\u2019s main executable.\n\nI also have the option to configure the automatic transfer of application-generated log files into a S3 bucket. After I\u2019m done with this configuration, I choose Create application.\n\nAfter my application setup is completed, I need to create a stream group, a collection of compute resources to run and stream the application. I navigate to Stream groups in the left navigation pane of the Amazon GameLift Streams console.\n\nOn this page, I define a description for my new stream group.\n\nHere, I select the capabilities and pricing of my stream group. Since my application is using Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Base, I make sure to select one of the compatible stream classes.\n\nNext, I need to link with the application I created in the previous step.\n\nOn the Configure stream settings page, I can configure additional locations for my stream group, bringing in additional capacity from other AWS Regions. There are two capacity options that I can choose, always-on capacity and on-demand capacity. The default capacity setting provides one streaming slot, which is sufficient for initial testing.\n\nThen, I need to review my configuration and choose Create stream group.\n\nWith stream groups configured, I can test my game streaming. I navigate to the Test stream page on the console to launch my application as a stream. I select this stream group and select Choose.\n\nOn the next page, I can configure any command line arguments or environment variables to run my application. I don\u2019t need any extra configurations and choose Test stream.\n\nThen, I can see that my application is running as expected. I can also interact with my game. This test helps me verify that my game works properly in streaming mode and serves as an initial proof of concept.\n\nAfter I\u2019ve confirmed everything works, I can integrate the Web SDK into my own website. The Web SDK and AWS Software Development Kit (AWS SDK) with Amazon GameLift Streams APIs help me to embed game streams, similar to what I tested in the console, into any web page I manage.\n\nAdditional things to know\n\nAvailability \u2013 Amazon GameLift Streams is currently available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt). Additional streaming capacity can also be configured in US East (N. Virginia) and Europe (Ireland).\n\nAmazon GameLift Streams is currently available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt).

            "content": "Folks, the time has come to stop linking to Amazon. For good.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this site, you likely already knew this in your heart. And I\u2019m actually not here to give you the litany of reasons why Amazon\u2019s extractive capitalism, aggressive union-busting, take-no-prisoners monopolization of not just books but basically all commerce, and Jeff Bezos\u2019s insistence on using his ill-gotten gains to support the fascist takeover of the country are bad. The odds are, again, that you know this. And I do understand that none of us are perfect, that all of us are susceptible to the siren song of convenience and a good deal. That\u2019s not going to be solved for until we solve for a whole bunch of other things, and it\u2019s beyond any of us to do individually.\n\nBut there is something that we, the book industry, can do\u2014and it\u2019s something that would actually strike a small but meaningful blow at the behemoth! And that\u2019s to stop linking to your book on Amazon.\n\nIt is maddening to see writers who are otherwise full-throated in their support of progressive ideals scurrying to promote every time their book is sold for a penny or a dollar or whatever during an Amazon \u2018deal\u2019 day. It\u2019s infuriating to see publishers and authors alike putting together a list of links for where to buy a book with Amazon at the top of the list, even as they include Barnes & Noble, Bookshop.org, or a direct link to a local indie bookstore. And I tell you what: there is NO REASON to do it. Stop doing it! Stop linking to your book on Amazon!\n\nOf course, there is a reason that people will continue to do it: money. Even the most high-minded excuse\u2014that you want more people to read your book\u2014really just means that you want to sell more copies of your book. If you really wanted more people to read your book, you\u2019d give it away! Except we have come to believe, thanks to relentless oligarchic conditioning, that free must mean low-quality or bad or somehow less than anything that you\u2019d pay for\u2026 and so what you actually want is for people to pay for your book, because paying for your book tells publishers and the industry at large that you are worth giving money in the future, for your next project. And believe me, I get it, I really do. I want a book deal! I want to sell a bajillion copies of my work, or at least a few hundred of each book I hopefully someday get to publish, in the hopes that I can keep doing it forever.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nBut guess fucking what? It isn\u2019t a right to get to share your book, it does not (and by extension nor do you) deserve to be read, and it isn\u2019t even existential that you should be able to \u2018make money\u2019 off of your art! It\u2019s a privilege\u2014all of it is a privilege.\n\nYes, Amazon allows for an ostensible democratization of the landscape\u2014and I know, for certain, that I\u2019m going to get an earful from the self-publishing brigade, who will ride in to tell me that they need Amazon because that\u2019s where they can sell their books, that\u2019s how they can make any money at all, that\u2019s how they can get their work published outside of the gatekeeping that is the traditional publishing industry. And you know what, they might be right! Publishing is still far too cloistered, too careful, too white\u2014but giving a cut of your profit to an evil billionaire just so you can see your book in the world is not the flex that you think it is. Put your book on AO3 if you want people to read it so bad, or make a store on your website and print your book through IngramSpark if it\u2019s so important that you have hard copies.\n\nI do want to be clear: I get that it feels like there is a sacrifice, removing the link from your website. You will, almost certainly, sell fewer copies of your book this way. And that\u2019s going to turn a lot of you off from this idea. I know that authors I admire are going to end up posting about the next time their book is a Kindle Daily Deal or whatever, because they\u2019ve been told they have to post about it by their publicists or their agents or their friends or their deep desire to be seen and known and dear god won\u2019t someone buy my book please?!\n\nBut I bet it won\u2019t be as bad as you think. I bet that people will still buy your book through one of the maaaaaany other online retailers or via their local indie bookstore. And maybe, just maybe, that can be enough. We\u2019re never going back to the way that things were (or even, dare I say, the way they are now)\u2014so why not make a break? The best time to do it was yesterday, but the second-best time is right now. Show yourself and others how easy it is to say, \u201coh, maybe money isn\u2019t the most important thing\u201d and you\u2019ll be surprised at what might come out of that.\n\nOr at the very least, we can all stop giving Jeff Bezos quite so much of our everything.",

The company's operating income came in at a record $68.6 billion, which was up 86% year over year and was almost as much as the previous three years combined. And the star of the show was the cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS supplied more than half of the year's operating income with its net sales growing by 19% to over $100 billion.\n\nDon't misunderstand: Amazon's AWS is one of the most important cloud-computing platforms, and its growth has been stellar for years. But more recently, growth in the industry is getting a boost from interest in artificial intelligence (AI). In short, enterprises are turning to AWS to experiment with and ultimately adopt AI applications.\n\nTo provide this service to customers, Amazon is having to spend aggressively to boost its computing power. For 2025, management anticipates spending $100 billion in capital expenditures (capex). And CEO Andy Jassy said, \"The vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.\"\n\nAmazon's AI expenses will modestly weigh on 2025 profits\n\nI can never quite predict what investors will choose to focus on; I'm surprised that Amazon's capex guidance troubled anyone.

There are cases of businesses spending so much on AI that it hurt profit margins, and perhaps that's what investors are worried about.\n\nIn fairness, there is some substance to investors' concerns here. Amazon's management expects its full-year 2025 operating income to drop by $700 million compared to 2024.

Cloud-computing customers want more AI functionality. If Amazon wants AWS to stay massive and growing, it needs to give customers what they want. Its capex spending is necessary from a competitive perspective.\n\nFinally, if any company can afford it, it's Amazon. Consider that the company spent nearly $78 billion in capex in 2024 and still had free cash flow of $38 billion left over. Therefore, this is something Amazon can easily afford as it grows AWS.",

            "content": "Data sharing has become a crucial aspect of driving innovation, contributing to growth, and fostering collaboration across industries. According to this Gartner study, organizations promoting data sharing outperform their peers on most business value metrics. A straightforward data access and sharing mechanism is crucial for enabling effective data sharing across an organization. There are challenges such as complexity in managing cross-account permissions and difficulty in discovering the right data across accounts that organizations face when trying to share data products across AWS accounts. Amazon DataZone is a fully managed data management service that customers can use to catalog, discover, share, and govern data stored across Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nIn this post, we will cover how you can use Amazon DataZone to facilitate data collaboration between AWS accounts.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThis solution provides a streamlined way to enable cross-account data collaboration using Amazon DataZone domain association while maintaining security and governance. This post describes the process of using the business data catalog resource of Amazon DataZone to publish data assets so they\u2019re discoverable by other accounts. After they\u2019ve been published, you can query the published assets from another AWS account using analytical tools such as Amazon Athena and the Amazon Redshift query editor, as shown in the following figure.\n\nIn this solution (as shown in the preceding figure), the AWS account that contains the data assets is referred to as the producer account. The AWS account that needs to access or use the data from the producer account is referred to as the consumer account. The Amazon DataZone domain is created and managed within the producer account and then the consumer account is associated with that domain.\n\nAs part of Amazon DataZone domain association, Amazon DataZone uses AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the resource. When the producer and consumer AWS accounts are in the same organization within AWS Organizations, the domain association happens automatically. If the producer and consumer AWS accounts are in different organizations, AWS RAM sends an invitation to the consumer AWS account to accept or reject the resource grant.\n\nThis solution presents three Amazon DataZone user personas as:\n\nData administrators : Account owners in both producer and consumer AWS accounts. The data administrators are responsible for creating Amazon DataZone domains, configuring domain associations, and accepting domain associations within the Amazon DataZone domain.\n\n: Account owners in both producer and consumer AWS accounts. The data administrators are responsible for creating Amazon DataZone domains, configuring domain associations, and accepting domain associations within the Amazon DataZone domain. Data publishers : Users in producer AWS accounts. The data publishers are responsible for creating Amazon DataZone publish projects and environments, producing and publishing data assets, and accepting subscription requests.\n\n: Users in producer AWS accounts. The data publishers are responsible for creating Amazon DataZone publish projects and environments, producing and publishing data assets, and accepting subscription requests. Data subscribers: Users in consumer AWS accounts. The data subscribers are responsible for creating Amazon DataZone subscribe projects and environments, searching for and subscribing to data assets, and querying the data and deriving insights.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo follow along with the instructions, you will need:\n\nTwo AWS accounts, one serving as producer and other account serving as consumer. Create new AWS accounts if necessary.\n\nAn Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster or Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup in the producer and consumer AWS accounts provisioned by a data administrator.\n\nA secret in AWS Secrets Manager storing the master user credentials for the Amazon Redshift cluster or workgroup in the producer and consumer AWS accounts. The data administrators are responsible for creating secrets. The data producers and consumers can obtain the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secrets from the data administrators during the environment or environment profile creation steps.\n\n\n\nAmazon DataZone uses Amazon Redshift Datashares to share data across clusters and accounts. There are specific requirements and limitations for using Amazon Redshift datashares.\n\nFor cross-account data sharing, both the producer and consumer clusters must be encrypted. See Cluster encryption section of datashare-considerations for more information about the encryption process.\n\nData sharing is supported only for provisioned ra3 cluster types (ra3.16xlarge, ra3.4xlarge, and ra3.xlplus) and Amazon Redshift Serverless.\n\nWalkthrough:\n\nThe following are the high level steps to configure cross-account access. We\u2019ve provided step-by-step instructions in the following sections.\n\nCreate an Amazon DataZone domain in the producer account. The data administrator creates an Amazon DataZone domain. Request Amazon DataZone domain association from the producer account to the consumer account. Accept the domain association request in the consumer account. The data administrator accepts the domain association. Add data users to the Amazon DataZone domain. Create the necessary publish project for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift in the producer account. Create AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift environments to publish the data assets in the producer account. Create and run a data source for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift to publish assets into the business catalog. Create subscribe projects for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift. Create AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift environment profiles and environments in the subscribe project Subscribe to AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift tables. Consume the data using Athena and Amazon redshift editors. This step is performed by the data subscriber.\n\nCreate the Amazon DataZone domain in the producer account\n\nAmazon DataZone domains serve as high-level organizational units for assets, users, and projects, facilitating cross-team and cross-account collaboration. This step focusses on creating the Amazon DataZone domain in the producer account.\n\nSign in to the producer account AWS Management Console for Amazon DataZone using the data administrator credentials. Create an Amazon DataZone domain titled Demo_cross_account_domain using the instructions at create domains. On the Create domain screen, select Quick setup checkbox to automate several configuration steps, saving time and reducing the potential for setup errors. Quick setup enables two default blueprints and creates the default environment profiles for the data lake and data warehouse default blueprints.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Amazon DataZone domain association from the producer account to the consumer account\n\nTo associate the Amazon DataZone domain with the consumer account, the producer account requests a domain association. This involves providing necessary information about the consumer account and granting appropriate permissions for data access and management.\n\nSign in to the Amazon DataZone console of the producer account using the data administrator credentials. Navigate to the domain detail page, and then scroll down and select the Associated Accounts tab. Enter the consumer account IDs that you want to request association. Choose Add another account if you want to add more than one account. When you\u2019re satisfied with the list of account IDs, choose Request association. Use the latest (AWS RAM DataZonePortalReadWrite policy when requesting the account association. This policy allows users in the consumer account to execute Amazon DataZone APIs and to use the data portal interface.\n\nAccept an account association request from an Amazon DataZone domain\n\nThis step focuses on accepting the account association request from the Amazon DataZone domain in the consumer account. This allows the consumer account to be linked with the Amazon DataZone domain to enable data sharing and collaboration between the producer and consumer accounts.\n\nSign in to the consumer account and go to the Amazon DataZone console in the same AWS Region as the domain. On the Amazon DataZone home page, choose View requests. Select the name of the inviting Amazon DataZone domain and choose Review request. Choose Accept association, you should see the Demo_cross_account_domain state as associated in the Associated domains screen\n\nChoose the domain for which you want to enable an environment blueprint. From the Blueprints list, choose either the DefaultDataLake blueprint On the Permissions and resources page, for enabling the DefaultDataLake blueprint, for Glue Manage Access role, specify a new role that grants Amazon DataZone authorization to ingest and manage access to tables in AWS Glue and AWS Lake Formation.\n\nRepeat steps 4 to 6 to enable the DefaultDataWarehouse blueprint by choosing DefaultDataWarehouse instead of DefaultDataLake\n\nAdd data users to the Amazon DataZone domain\n\nTo grant access to the Amazon DataZone data portal from the console for data publisher and data Subscriber IAM users, use the following steps to add them in the User Management section of the Amazon DataZone domain. See Manage users in the Amazon DataZone console for additional details.\n\nSign in to the Amazon DataZone console as a data administrator using the producer account. Select the Amazon DataZone domain and, in the User management section, choose Add and select Add IAM users. On the Add users page, choose Current account and add the user ARN of the data producer and choose Add users. Next choose Associated account, and enter the data subscriber user\u2019s ARN and add the user by choosing Add users.\n\nCreate the publish project for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift\n\nThis step focuses on creating the publish project for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift in the producer account. The project will be used to publish data from your data sources to the appropriate AWS services.\n\nUsing the producer account, sign in to the Amazon DataZone console as a data publisher. Select View domains and select the demo_cross_account_domain. Choose the Open data portal link and sign in to the data portal. Choose Create New Project and create a project named Glue_Publish_Project for publishing AWS Glue data assets and create the project under demo_cross_account_domain. Create another project named Redshift_Publish_Project for publishing Amazon Redshift data assets, also under the demo_cross_account_domain.\n\nCreate AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift environments to publish the data assets\n\nIn this step, you set up AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift environments in the producer account to share data assets. The required infrastructure, such as the AWS Glue Data Catalog and Redshift cluster for storing data, should already be in place. After setup, this will allow the consumer account to access and use the shared data assets. See Create a new environment for detailed instructions on creating a new environment.\n\nCreate the AWS Glue environment and a new AWS Glue table\n\nIn the same Amazon DataZone domain demo_cross_account_domain, choose Browse Project and select the Glue_Publish_Project and create Glue_Publish_Environment using the default DataLakeProfile. Leave the producer_glue_db_name, consumer_glue_db_name and Workgroup_name blank. Choose Create Environment and wait for the process to complete. After the environment is created, browse the list of available projects and choose Glue_publish_project. Next, navigate to the Glue_Publish_Environment, and under Analytics tools, choose Amazon Athena to open the Athena query editor Choose Open Athena and make sure that Glue_Publish_Environment is selected in the Amazon DataZone environment dropdown at the upper right and that in Data on the left, glue_publish_environment_pub_db is selected as the Database. Create a new AWS Glue table for publishing to Amazon DataZone. Paste the following create table as select (CTAS) query script in the Query window and run it to create a new table named mkt_sls_table . The script creates a table with sample marketing and sales data. CREATE TABLE mkt_sls_table AS SELECT 146776932 AS ord_num, 23 AS sales_qty_sld, 23.4 AS wholesale_cost, 45.0 as lst_pr, 43.0 as sell_pr, 2.0 as disnt, 12 as ship_mode,13 as warehouse_id, 23 as item_id, 34 as ctlg_page, 232 as ship_cust_id, 4556 as bill_cust_id UNION ALL SELECT 46776931, 24, 24.4, 46, 44, 1, 14, 15, 24, 35, 222, 4551 UNION ALL SELECT 46777394, 42, 43.4, 60, 50, 10, 30, 20, 27, 43, 241, 4565 UNION ALL SELECT 46777831, 33, 40.4, 51, 46, 15, 16, 26, 33, 40, 234, 4563 UNION ALL SELECT 46779160, 29, 26.4, 50, 61, 8, 31, 15, 36, 40, 242, 4562 UNION ALL SELECT 46778595, 43, 28.4, 49, 47, 7, 28, 22, 27, 43, 224, 4555 UNION ALL SELECT 46779482, 34, 33.4, 64, 44, 10, 17, 27, 43, 52, 222, 4556 UNION ALL SELECT 46779650, 39, 37.4, 51, 62, 13, 31, 25, 31, 52, 224, 4551 UNION ALL SELECT 46780524, 33, 40.4, 60, 53, 18, 32, 31, 31, 39, 232, 4563 UNION ALL SELECT 46780634, 39, 35.4, 46, 44, 16, 33, 19, 31, 52, 242, 4557 UNION ALL SELECT 46781887, 24, 30.4, 54, 62, 13, 18, 29, 24, 52, 223, 4561 Go to the Tables and Views section and verify that the mkt_sls_table table was successfully created.\n\nCreate the Amazon Redshift publish environment and a new Redshift table\n\nStaying in the same Amazon DataZone domain demo_cross_account_domain, choose Browse Project, to create an Amazon Redshift publish environment, select the Redshift_Publish_Project and create Redshift_Publish_Environment using the default data warehouse profile. To configure environment parameters, enter the name of your Amazon Redshift cluster or workgroup, specify the database name and enter the AWS Secrets Manager secret ARN for the Redshift cluster or workgroup. You need to make sure that the secret in Secrets Manager includes the following tags. These tags help Amazon DataZone implement proper access control so that only authorized users within the correct Amazon DataZone project and domain can access the Amazon Redshift resource: For Amazon Redshift cluster: DataZone.rs.cluster: <cluster_name:database name> For Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup: DataZone.rs.workgroup: <workgroup_name:database_name> AmazonDataZoneProject: <projectID> AmazonDataZoneDomain: <domainID> For more information for creating redshift database user secret in secret manager, see Storing database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.\n\nFor more information for creating redshift database user secret in secret manager, see Storing database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.\n\nNote that the database user you provide in Secrets Manager must have superuser permissions. Data publishers should work with the data administrator to get the details of the Redshift cluster or workgroup, database name, and secret ARN. The schema is optional. Choose Create Environment and wait for the process to complete. Verify that the environment is created successfully without errors. Browse the list of available projects and select Redshift_publish_project . Navigate to Redshift_publish_environment . Under Analytics tools, choose Amazon Redshift to open the Amazon Redshift query editor. Select the Redshift cluster that you want to connect, choose Save and then choose Create Connection using temporary credentials with your IAM identity. Create a new Redshift table. You can use the CTAS query to create a new table named rs_sls_tbl . Use the provided CTAS script, which creates a table with sample sales data in the datazone_env_redshift_publish_environment schema. CREATE TABLE \"datazone_env_redshift_publish_environment\".\"rs_sls_tbl\" AS SELECT 146776932 AS ord_num, 23 AS sales_qty_sld, 23.4 AS wholesale_cost, 45.0 as lst_pr, 43.0 as sell_pr, 2.0 as disnt, 12 as ship_mode,13 as warehouse_id, 23 as item_id, 34 as ctlg_page, 232 as ship_cust_id, 4556 as bill_cust_id UNION ALL SELECT 46776931, 24, 24.4, 46, 44, 1, 14, 15, 24, 35, 222, 4551 UNION ALL SELECT 46777394, 42, 43.4, 60, 50, 10, 30, 20, 27, 43, 241, 4565 UNION ALL SELECT 46777831, 33, 40.4, 51, 46, 15, 16, 26, 33, 40, 234, 4563 UNION ALL SELECT 46779160, 29, 26.4, 50, 61, 8, 31, 15, 36, 40, 242, 4562 UNION ALL SELECT 46778595, 43, 28.4, 49, 47, 7, 28, 22, 27, 43, 224, 4555 UNION ALL SELECT 46779482, 34, 33.4, 64, 44, 10, 17, 27, 43, 52, 222, 4556 UNION ALL SELECT 46779650, 39, 37.4, 51, 62, 13, 31, 25, 31, 52, 224, 4551 UNION ALL SELECT 46780524, 33, 40.4, 60, 53, 18, 32, 31, 31, 39, 232, 4563 UNION ALL SELECT 46780634, 39, 35.4, 46, 44, 16, 33, 19, 31, 52, 242, 4557 UNION ALL SELECT 46781887, 24, 30.4, 54, 62, 13, 18, 29, 24, 52, 223, 4561 Make sure that the rs_sls_tbl table is successfully created.\n\nPublish assets into the common business catalog\n\nIn this step, you create and run the Amazon DataZone data sources for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift. You will then publish the data assets from these data sources.\n\nThe Amazon DataZone data sources allow you to connect to various data sources, including databases, data warehouses, and data lakes, and ingest metadata into Amazon DataZone. By creating and running these data sources, you can make your data available for analysis, transformation, and sharing within your organization.\n\nAfter the data sources are set up, you can publish the data assets from these sources to make them accessible to other users and applications. This process involves mapping the data assets to the appropriate business terms and metadata, making sure that the data is properly described and categorized.\n\nAdd an AWS Glue data source to publish the new AWS Glue table.\n\nStay signed in the producer account and Amazon DataZone console as a data publisher. Choose Select project from the top navigation pane and select the Glue_Publish_Project that you want to add the data source to. Select the Glue_Publish_Environment. Choose Create data source.

Choose Publish Asset and the rs_sls_table table will be published to the business data catalog.\n\nCreate subscribe projects for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift\n\nIn this step, you create the projects for subscribing to AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift data assets within your Amazon DataZone domain.\n\nSign in to the Amazon DataZone console as a data subscriber IAM user using the consumer account. Choose Associated domains and select the demo_cross_account_domain. Select the Open data portal link and sign in to the data portal. Choose Create New Project and create a project named Glue_Subscribe_Project for subscribing to the AWS Glue data assets. Create another project named Redshift_Subscribe_Project for subscribing to the Redshift data assets.\n\nCreate AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift environment profiles\n\nIn this step, you will set up the environment profiles and environments for AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift in your Amazon DataZone projects. This will allow you to connect and interact with resources across AWS accounts.\n\nThe purpose of environment profiles in Amazon DataZone is to streamline the process of environment creation. By using environment profiles, you can preconfigure essential placement information such as AWS account and AWS Region. In this solution, you will configure environment profiles with placement information pointing to your consumer account.\n\nYou will also create an Amazon DataZone environment from the profiles you are about to create. This will provision the necessary resources in the consumer account and establish the connections between the Amazon DataZone domain and the consumer account. After the environments are created, you can work with AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift assets seamlessly across different AWS accounts within your Amazon DataZone ecosystem.\n\nCreate an AWS Glue profile and environment\n\nStay signed in the consumer account\u2019s Amazon DataZone console as a data subscriber IAM, select the Environments tab and then choose Create environment profile.

These challenges stem from the complexity of configuring proper cross-account access permissions and roles while maintaining robust data governance and security controls.\n\nYou can use the solution described in the post to publish and consume data across AWS accounts and make sure that reliable access and consistent data governance is in place. By combining the power of AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift, you can unlock valuable insights and accelerate your data-driven decision-making processes.\n\nIn this post, you followed a step-by-step guide to set up cross-account data sharing using Amazon DataZone domain association. You learned how to publish data assets from a producer account. You also learned how to subscribe to and query the published assets from a consumer account. You can optionally use AWS Lake Formation access monitoring to view permissions and data access activities. AWS Lake Formation uses AWS CloudTrail for historical analysis and CloudTrail retains logs for 90 days by default.\n\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with the elements involved in cross-account data sharing using Amazon DataZone and your choice of analytical tool, you\u2019re ready to try it with multiple accounts.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nArun Pradeep Selvaraj is a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS.

            "content": "New U.S. tariffs are weighing on shares of e-commerce companies this week, including tech giant Amazon (AMZN) stock. Tariffs could slow consumer spending and cut into margins for U.S. e-commerce companies, according to Bank of America analysts, but won't hit all firms equally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday placed a 25% tariff on most imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as increased tariffs on China imports to 20% from 10%. BofA Securities analyst Justin Post told clients Wednesday that the escalating trade conflict brings risks to supply chains, inflation and corporate earnings. There is also the potential for a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nFor e-commerce in particular, Post said the risk is that inflation from tariffs could crowd out discretionary spending and higher costs could also eat into margins.\n\n\"While tariffs are a sector negative, we see several companies within our (e-commerce) coverage that are better positioned on a relative basis,\" Post said in a Wednesday client note. \"First, we think platforms with large third-party selections, such as Amazon or eBay (EBAY), can allow for better substitution and/or for consumers to self-select cheaper items. Secondly, many marketplace operators \u2014 Amazon, eBay, Etsy (ETSY) \u2014 still collect commissions on the final value of third-party sales, so higher pricing could be a tailwind.\"\n\nChewy, eBay Stock Have Less Exposure\n\nAll e-commerce stocks are vulnerable if consumers slow their spending. But Chewy (CHWY) and eBay have less tariff exposure, Post added. BofA estimates Chewy and eBay receive less than 10% and 5%, respectively, of goods from China. EBay also has an advantage through offering refurbished goods, Post added.\n\nWayfair (W) has the largest estimated exposure to China among stocks covered by BofA's e-commerce analysts, at more than 40%. Amazon is second at 30%.\n\nAmazon Stock: Slumping Five Straight Weeks\n\nOn the stock market today, Amazon stock is down 1.7% at 207.34 in midday trades. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg early Wednesday that tariffs on Mexico and Canada may be rolled back at least in part.\n\nAmazon is on pace for a fifth straight week of declines since it reached a high of 242.52 in early February. Shares slumped 3% Monday and a half-percent Tuesday on news of the tariffs. But the e-commerce giant stock found support above its long-term 200 day average Wednesday. Amazon is also investing significantly to offer artificial intelligence services through its cloud business, and AI stocks have struggled\n\nMeanwhile, eBay stock was a rare member of the Internet-Retail stock group tracked by IBD to close higher on Monday and Tuesday. Shares of the e-commerce marketplace company are ahead 1.4% this week. Shares are looking to bounce back after a lower-than-expected Q1 sales forecast sent eBay stock tumbling 8% last Thursday.\n\nThe 58 stocks in the Retail-Internet group tracked by IBD have lost a cumulative 3.9% this week. The group includes Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Wayfair, Chewy, DoorDash (DASH) and Instacart parent Maplebear (CART).

            "content": "Businesses are increasingly adopting real-time data processing to stay ahead of user expectations and market changes. Industries such as retail, finance, manufacturing, and smart cities are using streaming data for everything from optimizing supply chains to detecting fraud and improving urban planning. The ability to use data as it is generated has become a critical competitive advantage for businesses, driving demand for a scalable data lake architecture for storing and managing streaming data. More recently, users are increasingly using Apache Iceberg to organize their streaming data in data lakes to use its database-like features, such as schema evolution, time travel, and ACID transactions.\n\nAmazon S3 Tables provide purpose-built storage with a simple, performant, and cost-effective way to store and query Apache Iceberg tables. S3 Tables continuously optimize storage to maximize query performance and minimize costs, making it an excellent choice for businesses looking to streamline their data lake operations without further infrastructure setup. Businesses can stream and query tables in S3 table buckets through AWS analytics services, such as Amazon Data Firehose and Amazon Athena, by integrating the table buckets with AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Lake Formation. The S3 Tables integration with AWS analytics services for table buckets is in preview. Firehose is a fully managed serverless service that streams data from various sources to data lakes, data warehouses, and analytics data stores. With built-in support for Iceberg, Firehose can deliver real-time data from multiple sources to Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 without provisioning further resources or paying for idle streams during non-use hours. It streamlines data ingestion by processing streaming records as they arrive, and eliminates multi-step processes involved in writing streaming data in raw formats and converting it to Apache Iceberg format.\n\nIn this post, we walk through building a fully managed data lake using Firehose and S3 Tables to store and analyze real-time streaming data. We use a custom streaming source to deliver data into a table in an S3 table bucket, but the same workflow can be followed for other sources supported by Firehose that are listed in this Amazon Data Firehose user guide.\n\nSolution overview\n\nIn this solution, we demonstrate an example where a user ingests streaming data from a source directly into a table in S3 table buckets. We start with creating an S3 table bucket and integrating it with AWS analytics services through AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Lake Formation. Then, we use Amazon Kinesis Data Generator to simulate and publish real-time data streams to Firehose and use Athena to view the data that is streamed into the table in table bucket.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo follow along, you need the following setup:\n\nWalkthrough\n\nThe following steps walk you through this solution.\n\nCreate an S3 table bucket and integrate with AWS Analytics services\n\nNavigate to Amazon S3 in the Console. Choose Table buckets and then Enable integration if the integration with AWS Analytics services isn\u2019t already enabled, as shown in the following figure. This integration allows users to discover all the tables created in this AWS Region and this account in AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Lake Formation, and access them through AWS services, such as Firehose, Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon EMR. When the integration is complete, all existing and future table buckets are automatically added as a sub-catalog, namespaces are organized as databases, and the tables within those namespaces are populated as tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. To learn more about this integration, refer to Using Amazon S3 with Analytics services.\n\nSpecify a name for your table bucket and continue with Create table bucket, as shown in the following figure.\n\n2. Create a namespace in the table bucket\n\nUsing the AWS CLI, create a namespace s3tables_demo_namespace in the table bucket created previously, as shown in the following. Namespaces are logical constructs that help you organize your tables in a scalable manner.\n\naws s3tables create-namespace \\ --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:<region>:<account-id>:bucket/<s3tablebucket>\\ --namespace s3tables_demo_namespace\n\n3. Create a table in the table bucket\n\nUsing AWS CLI, create a table in the existing namespace in the table bucket as s3tables_demo_table . When you create a table, you can also define a schema for the table. For this post, we create a table with a schema consisting of three fields: ID, name, and value.\n\naws s3tables create-table --cli-input-json file://mytabledefinition.json\n\nThe following is the sample mytabledefinition.json used to set the table schema.\n\n{ \"tableBucketARN\": \"arn:aws:s3tables:ap-northeast-1:<account-id>:bucket/<s3tablebucket>\", \"namespace\": \"s3tables_demo_namespace\", \"name\": \"s3tables_demo_table\", \"format\": \"ICEBERG\", \"metadata\": { \"iceberg\": { \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"int\",\"required\": true}, {\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\"}, {\"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"int\"} ] } } } }\n\nThe following image shows the sample output from the command:\n\n4. Create a resource link to the namespace\n\nFirehose streams data to the tables in the database registered in the default catalog of the AWS Glue Data Catalog. To stream data to tables in S3 table buckets, create a resource link in the default catalog that points to the namespace in table bucket. A resource link is a Data Catalog object that acts as an alias or pointer to another Data Catalog resource, such as a database or table. To create a resource link using AWS CLI, provide the namespace you created in Step 2 for DatabaseName and replace <region> and <account-id> with your values before you run the command.\n\naws glue create-database --region <region> \\ --cli-input-json \\ '{ \"CatalogId\": \"<account-id>\", \"DatabaseInput\": { \"Name\": \"s3tables_resource_link\", \"TargetDatabase\":{ \"CatalogId\":\"<account-id>:s3tablescatalog/<s3tablebucket>\", \"DatabaseName\":\"s3tables_demo_namespace\", \"Region\": \"<region>\" } } }\u2018\n\nThe following image shows the sample output from the command.\n\n5. Create an IAM role for Firehose\n\nCreate an IAM role that grants permissions to Firehose to perform operations on tables in the default AWS Glue Data Catalog, to back up failed records during streaming in a general-purpose S3 bucket, and to interact with Kinesis Data Stream. Additionally, depending on your Firehose configuration, you may choose to grant extra permissions for Amazon CloudWatch logging, and AWS Lambda function operations. To configure, navigate to IAM in the Console, and create an IAM role with permissions policy as mentioned in this Amazon S3 Tables user guide. Keep track of the role you create, as you need it later to grant AWS Lake Formation permissions.\n\n6. Configure AWS Lake Formation permissions\n\nAWS Lake Formation manages access to your table resources. Lake Formation uses its own permissions model that enables fine-grained access control for Data Catalog resources. For Firehose to ingest data into table buckets, the Firehose role (created in step 5) requires DESCRIBE permissions on the resource link (created in step 4) to discover the S3 Tables namespace through the resource link and read/write permission on the underlying table.\n\nTo add describe permissions on the resource link, navigate to Lake Formation in the Console. Choose Databases on the left menu, and then choose the resource link you created in Step 4. Choose Actions, choose Grant, and then grant Describe permission to the Firehose role, as shown in the following figures.\n\nIn this example, the Firehose role is named s3tFirehoseRole .\n\nTo provide read and write permission on specific tables, go back and choose Databases on the left menu, then choose the resource link you created in Step 4. First, choose Actions, and then choose Grant on target.\n\nChoose the Firehose role, databases, and tables, then grant Super permission to the Firehose role, as shown in the following figures.\n\n7. Set up a Firehose stream\n\nTo create a Firehose stream, open Firehose in the Console and choose Create Firehose Stream. Choose Direct PUT as the source and Apache Iceberg Tables as the destination. Then, choose a name for your Firehose stream, adhering to the naming conventions displayed in the interface, as shown in the following figure.\n\nTo configure Destination settings for your table bucket, you need to configure the database and table names to which Firehose should write. If you want the Firehose stream to write to one table only, then you can configure the Unique key configuration section. To configure this section, choose the resource link ( s3tables_resource_link ) that you created in Step 4 as your database name, and the table ( s3tables_demo_table ) you created in Step 3 as the table name, as shown in the following figure. Firehose delivers to S3ErrorOutputPrefix if it fails to deliver to the configured table.\n\nSpecify an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket to store records that fail to be delivered to your S3 table bucket, as shown in the following figure.\n\nUnder IAM role, choose the role you previously created for Firehose in Step 5, then choose Create Firehose stream to create your Firehose stream, as shown in the following figure.\n\nWhen the stream is created, monitor the Firehose delivery stream status until it changes to Active, as shown in the following figure\n\n8. Send streaming data using Kinesis Data Generator\n\nKinesis Data Generator is an application that allows you to send streaming data to Firehose. To begin, first configure Kinesis Data Generator for your account. Then, set the Region to match your Firehose, and choose the Firehose stream created in Step 7. Use the following template that matches the table schema defined in Step 3, as shown in the following figure. Depending on the buffer interval set when creating the Firehose stream, it may take up to 900 seconds for the data to appear in your table. For this post, we leave it at the default value of 300 seconds.\n\n{ \"id\": {{random.number(99999)}}, \"name\": \"{{random.arrayElement( [\"CHECKIN\",\"CHECKOUT\",\"PAYMENT_FULL\",\"PAYMENT_PARTIAL\"] )}}\", \"value\": {{random.number(99999)}} }\n\n9. Verify and query data using Athena\n\nTo query the data using Athena, you must grant AWS Lake Formation permissions on the S3 table to the user or role you plan to use for Athena queries. In the left navigation pane of the Lake Formation console, choose Data permissions and choose Grant, and then choose the user/role you will use to access Athena under Principals. In the LF-Tags or Catalog resources choose Named Data Catalog resources, Default catalog, and the resource link associated with your S3 table bucket. Then choose the S3 table and grant Super under Table permissions, as shown in the following figure.\n\nTo query and verify data ingested from Firehose, run a SELECT command in Athena as shown in the following figure. As long as data is being streamed from Kinesis Data Generator, you should continue to see the row count increasing in this table, confirming successful data ingestion.\n\nCleaning up\n\nTo avoid future charges, delete the resources you created in Amazon S3 Tables and Firehose.\n\nConsiderations and limitations\n\nBefore using Firehose with Apache Iceberg, you should be aware of the considerations and limitations. For more information, see considerations and limitations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we showed you how to build a managed data lake from a streaming data source using Amazon Data Firehose and Amazon S3 Tables. We also showed how to query these tables from S3 table buckets using Amazon Athena. This integration enables businesses to automatically capture, store, and analyze streaming data without managing complex infrastructure, thereby accelerating data-driven decision making.",

            "content": "Amazon\u2019s grip on TV advertising keeps tightening, and now it\u2019s gunning for the industry\u2019s biggest payouts: upfront commitments and scatter market budgets. To do so, it\u2019s launching Complete TV, a tool designed to make the notoriously convoluted process of managing those investments as seamless as clicking \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d.\n\nThe pitch is simple: Complete TV gives AI-powered recommendations to help TV buyers optimize their spending across Prime Video and other premium streaming publishers. They do this by inputting their campaign details and target audiences, and, in theory, Amazon\u2019s machine-learning models take care of the rest, allocating spend in real-time across both linear and streaming TV.\n\nFor marketers, this kind of automation tackles a persistent industry headache: delivering on upfront commitments in full. Historically, shifting audience behavior, inconsistent measurement and last-minute inventory fluctuations have made it difficult for advertisers to spend exactly as planned. So much so, in fact, that they often find themselves scrambling to move money into the scatter market to fill shortfalls \u2014 or worse, wasting budget on redundant reach.\n\nAmazon is positioning Complete TV as the fix for those inefficiencies.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to insert ourselves in between the advertiser and the publisher, where they already have that working relationship,\u201d said vp of Amazon Ads Kelly MacLean. \u201cInstead, we want to just make it easy for them [the publisher] to deliver anything that\u2019s pre-negotiated.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s data advantage\n\nUnlike most streaming ad platforms, which rely on a limited set of engagement metrics, Amazon has a sweeping view of consumer behavior, spanning retail purchases, browsing habits and online video viewing.\n\nThis wealth of first-party data allows Amazon to offer advertisers a granular understanding of where their audiences are, what they\u2019re interested in and when they\u2019re most likely to convert. Complete TV uses that intel to optimize ad placements in a way that few competitors can match, particularly as traditional identifiers like third-party cookies become obsolete.\n\nThat\u2019s especially important for marketers aiming to maximize reach without bombarding the same audience. If they\u2019ve met their upfront commitments and still have money left for the scatter market, for instance, Complete TV helps ensure those extra dollars find new audiences instead of the same ones.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really where the dashboard is critical to monitoring those forecasted and actual outcomes \u2014 not just for incremental reach but also for things like publisher reach overlap, brand, lift, long term sales impact, and commitment pacing,\u201d said Maclean.\n\nHer point touches on a larger challenge in TV advertising: proving real business value beyond vanity metrics. That\u2019s where Amazon sees an opening. By utilizing the Amazon Marketing Cloud, Compete TV promises advertisers deeper analytics, offering them a clearer picture of how their upfront deals and scatter market buys translate into tangible outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe are agnostic so any measurement partner an advertiser is working with today they\u2019ll be able to continue to do so with Compete TV,\u201d said MacLean.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nOf course, Amazon isn\u2019t rolling out this tool out of pure altruism. By making TV ad buying easier, smarter and more accountable, the commerce giant isn\u2019t just streamlining the process, it\u2019s ensuring that more ad dollars flow into its ecosystem.\n\nYet, as always, the real question is how much control advertisers are willing to cede to Amazon\u2019s algorithms. Automated ad placement tools, no matter how sophisticated, still require trust that the system is deleting ads to the places marketers need them to be rather than simply steering those dollars toward the places Amazon wants. And with Amazon\u2019s increasing dominance in the advertising space \u2014 it effectively repriced the streaming ad market last year \u2014 some buyers may wonder whether they\u2019re optimizing their campaigns or simply optimizing Amazon\u2019s bottom line.\n\nStill, in a world where streaming ad dollars are growing and traditional TV models are fading, tools like Complete TV represent the inevitable future. Whether that future is as seamless as Amazon claims remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cAmazon isn\u2019t selling as much total TV ads as some of the bigger legacy companies when you combine their linear and TV,\u201d said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at eMarketer in an emailed response to Digiday. \u201cBut Amazon is already among the top streaming services and exceeds lower tier TV networks in ad revenue. Amazon\u2019s influence will only grow as it adds more sports and gains more time spent. It isn\u2019t in YouTube or Disney territory but it is a dominant player nonetheless whose influence is growing.\u201d",

The company has started to add AI to some of those devices.\n\nAmazon also offers smart glasses, smart rings and fitness trackers, per the report.\n\nWhen the company unveiled Alexa+ Wednesday (Feb. 26), Amazon said the new version of its voice assistant is enhanced with generative AI, making it smarter and more responsive.\n\nAlexa+ can handle more complex tasks like ordering groceries, booking services, sending messages, searching video libraries and reading documents. One of its key features is its ability to remember past interactions and use them to provide more personalized responses.\n\nThe new version of the voice assistant is expected to roll out soon, offering users more advanced AI features through their existing Alexa devices.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence found in 2023 that 27% of consumers had used a voice-activated device or speaker in the previous 12 months.\n\nIn addition, 54% of consumers said they would prefer voice technology in the future because it is faster than typing or using a touchscreen, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cHow Consumers Want to Live in the Voice Economy.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s debut of Alexa+ came more than a year after the company announced its plans to integrate AI into the voice assistant.\n\nThe delay highlighted the challenges tech companies face in integrating AI. Apple has struggled with similar issues as it works to enhance its virtual assistant, Siri, with generative AI technology.\n\nThe CNN reported noted that Microsoft is another one of the tech giants racing to add AI-powered agents and chatbots into their devices and operating systems.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

            "content": "Many applications need to interact with content available through different modalities. Some of these applications process complex documents, such as insurance claims and medical bills. Mobile apps need to analyze user-generated media. Organizations need to build a semantic index on top of their digital assets that include documents, images, audio, and video files. However, getting insights from unstructured multimodal content is not easy to set up: you have to implement processing pipelines for the different data formats and go through multiple steps to get the information you need. That usually means having multiple models in production for which you have to handle cost optimizations (through fine-tuning and prompt engineering), safeguards (for example, against hallucinations), integrations with the target applications (including data formats), and model updates.\n\nTo make this process easier, we introduced in preview during AWS re:Invent Amazon Bedrock Data Automation, a capability of Amazon Bedrock that streamlines the generation of valuable insights from unstructured, multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and videos. With Bedrock Data Automation, you can reduce the development time and effort to build intelligent document processing, media analysis, and other multimodal data-centric automation solutions.\n\nYou can use Bedrock Data Automation as a standalone feature or as a parser for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to index insights from multimodal content and provide more relevant responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n\nToday, Bedrock Data Automation is now generally available with support for cross-region inference endpoints to be available in more AWS Regions and seamlessly use compute across different locations. Based on your feedback during the preview, we also improved accuracy and added support for logo recognition for images and videos.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at how this works in practice.\n\nUsing Amazon Bedrock Data Automation with cross-region inference endpoints\n\nThe blog post published for the Bedrock Data Automation preview shows how to use the visual demo in the Amazon Bedrock console to extract information from documents and videos. I recommend you go through the console demo experience to understand how this capability works and what you can do to customize it. For this post, I focus more on how Bedrock Data Automation works in your applications, starting with a few steps in the console and following with code samples.\n\nThe Data Automation section of the Amazon Bedrock console now asks for confirmation to enable cross-region support the first time you access it. For example:\n\nFrom an API perspective, the InvokeDataAutomationAsync operation now requires an additional parameter ( dataAutomationProfileArn ) to specify the data automation profile to use. The value for this parameter depends on the Region and your AWS account ID:\n\narn:aws:bedrock:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:data-automation-profile/us.data-automation-v1\n\nAlso, the dataAutomationArn parameter has been renamed to dataAutomationProjectArn to better reflect that it contains the project Amazon Resource Name (ARN). When invoking Bedrock Data Automation, you now need to specify a project or a blueprint to use. If you pass in blueprints, you will get custom output. To continue to get standard default output, configure the parameter DataAutomationProjectArn to use arn:aws:bedrock:<REGION>:aws:data-automation-project/public-default .\n\nAs the name suggests, the InvokeDataAutomationAsync operation is asynchronous. You pass the input and output configuration and, when the result is ready, it\u2019s written on an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket as specified in the output configuration. You can receive an Amazon EventBridge notification from Bedrock Data Automation using the notificationConfiguration parameter.\n\nWith Bedrock Data Automation, you can configure outputs in two ways:\n\nStandard output delivers predefined insights relevant to a data type, such as document semantics, video chapter summaries, and audio transcripts. With standard outputs, you can set up your desired insights in just a few steps.\n\ndelivers predefined insights relevant to a data type, such as document semantics, video chapter summaries, and audio transcripts. With standard outputs, you can set up your desired insights in just a few steps. Custom output lets you specify extraction needs using blueprints for more tailored insights.\n\nTo see the new capabilities in action, I create a project and customize the standard output settings. For documents, I choose plain text instead of markdown. Note that you can automate these configuration steps using the Bedrock Data Automation API.\n\nFor videos, I want a full audio transcript and a summary of the entire video. I also ask for a summary of each chapter.\n\nTo configure a blueprint, I choose Custom output setup in the Data automation section of the Amazon Bedrock console navigation pane. There, I search for the US-Driver-License sample blueprint. You can browse other sample blueprints for more examples and ideas.\n\nSample blueprints can\u2019t be edited, so I use the Actions menu to duplicate the blueprint and add it to my project.

Success Asset ID: 0 - Standard output Semantic modality: VIDEO Duration: 810476 ms Summary: In this comprehensive demonstration, a technical expert explores the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) while showcasing a practical application using AWS services. He begins by addressing a common misconception about LLMs, explaining that while they possess general world knowledge from their training data, they lack current, real-time information unless connected to external data sources. To illustrate this concept, he demonstrates an \"Outfit Planner\" application that provides clothing recommendations based on location and weather conditions. Using Brisbane, Australia as an example, the application combines LLM capabilities with real-time weather data to suggest appropriate attire like lightweight linen shirts, shorts, and hats for the tropical climate. The demonstration then shifts to the Amazon Bedrock platform, which enables users to build and scale generative AI applications using foundation models. The speaker showcases the \"OutfitAssistantAgent,\" explaining how it accesses real-time weather data to make informed clothing recommendations. Through the platform's \"Show Trace\" feature, he reveals the agent's decision-making process and how it retrieves and processes location and weather information. The technical implementation details are explored as the speaker configures the OutfitAssistant using Amazon Bedrock. The agent's workflow is designed to be fully serverless and managed within the Amazon Bedrock service. Further diving into the technical aspects, the presentation covers the AWS Lambda console integration, showing how to create action group functions that connect to external services like the OpenWeatherMap API. The speaker emphasizes that LLMs become truly useful when connected to tools providing relevant data sources, whether databases, text files, or external APIs. The presentation concludes with the speaker encouraging viewers to explore more AWS developer content and engage with the channel through likes and subscriptions, reinforcing the practical value of combining LLMs with external data sources for creating powerful, context-aware applications. Statistics: - Speaket count: 1 - Chapter count: 6 - Shot count: 48 Chapter 0 00:00:00:00-00:01:32:01 (92025 ms) - Chapter summary: A man with a beard and glasses, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt with various logos and text, is sitting at a desk in front of a colorful background. He discusses the frequent release of new large language models (LLMs) and how people often test these models by asking questions like \"Who won the World Series?\" The man explains that LLMs are trained on general data from the internet, so they may have information about past events but not current ones. He then poses the question of what he wants from an LLM, stating that he desires general world knowledge, such as understanding basic concepts like \"up is up\" and \"down is down,\" but does not need specific factual knowledge. The man suggests that he can attach other systems to the LLM to access current factual data relevant to his needs. He emphasizes the importance of having general world knowledge and the ability to use tools and be linked into agentic workflows, which he refers to as \"agentic workflows.\" The man encourages the audience to add this term to their spell checkers, as it will likely become commonly used. Chapter 1 00:01:32:01-00:03:38:18 (126560 ms) - Chapter summary: The video showcases a man with a beard and glasses demonstrating an \"Outfit Planner\" application on his laptop. The application allows users to input their location, such as Brisbane, Australia, and receive recommendations for appropriate outfits based on the weather conditions. The man explains that the application generates these recommendations using large language models, which can sometimes provide inaccurate or hallucinated information since they lack direct access to real-world data sources. The man walks through the process of using the Outfit Planner, entering Brisbane as the location and receiving weather details like temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. He then shows how the application suggests outfit options, including a lightweight linen shirt, shorts, sandals, and a hat, along with an image of a woman wearing a similar outfit in a tropical setting. Throughout the demonstration, the man points out the limitations of current language models in providing accurate and up-to-date information without external data connections. He also highlights the need to edit prompts and adjust settings within the application to refine the output and improve the accuracy of the generated recommendations. Chapter 2 00:03:38:18-00:07:19:06 (220620 ms) - Chapter summary: The video demonstrates the Amazon Bedrock platform, which allows users to build and scale generative AI applications using foundation models (FMs). [speaker_0] introduces the platform's overview, highlighting its key features like managing FMs from AWS, integrating with custom models, and providing access to leading AI startups. The video showcases the Amazon Bedrock console interface, where [speaker_0] navigates to the \"Agents\" section and selects the \"OutfitAssistantAgent\" agent. [speaker_0] tests the OutfitAssistantAgent by asking it for outfit recommendations in Brisbane, Australia. The agent provides a suggestion of wearing a light jacket or sweater due to cool, misty weather conditions. To verify the accuracy of the recommendation, [speaker_0] clicks on the \"Show Trace\" button, which reveals the agent's workflow and the steps it took to retrieve the current location details and weather information for Brisbane. The video explains that the agent uses an orchestration and knowledge base system to determine the appropriate response based on the user's query and the retrieved data. It highlights the agent's ability to access real-time information like location and weather data, which is crucial for generating accurate and relevant responses. Chapter 3 00:07:19:06-00:11:26:13 (247214 ms) - Chapter summary: The video demonstrates the process of configuring an AI assistant agent called \"OutfitAssistant\" using Amazon Bedrock. [speaker_0] introduces the agent's purpose, which is to provide outfit recommendations based on the current time and weather conditions. The configuration interface allows selecting a language model from Anthropic, in this case the Claud 3 Haiku model, and defining natural language instructions for the agent's behavior. [speaker_0] explains that action groups are groups of tools or actions that will interact with the outside world. The OutfitAssistant agent uses Lambda functions as its tools, making it fully serverless and managed within the Amazon Bedrock service. [speaker_0] defines two action groups: \"get coordinates\" to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates from a place name, and \"get current time\" to determine the current time based on the location. The \"get current weather\" action requires calling the \"get coordinates\" action first to obtain the location coordinates, then using those coordinates to retrieve the current weather information. This demonstrates the agent's workflow and how it utilizes the defined actions to generate outfit recommendations. Throughout the video, [speaker_0] provides details on the agent's configuration, including its name, description, model selection, instructions, and action groups. The interface displays various options and settings related to these aspects, allowing [speaker_0] to customize the agent's behavior and functionality. Chapter 4 00:11:26:13-00:13:00:17 (94160 ms) - Chapter summary: The video showcases a presentation by [speaker_0] on the AWS Lambda console and its integration with machine learning models for building powerful agents. [speaker_0] demonstrates how to create an action group function using AWS Lambda, which can be used to generate text responses based on input parameters like location, time, and weather data. The Lambda function code is shown, utilizing external services like OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather information. [speaker_0] explains that for a large language model to be useful, it needs to connect to tools providing relevant data sources, such as databases, text files, or external APIs. The presentation covers the process of defining actions, setting up Lambda functions, and leveraging various tools within the AWS environment to build intelligent agents capable of generating context-aware responses. Chapter 5 00:13:00:17-00:13:28:10 (27761 ms) - Chapter summary: A man with a beard and glasses, wearing a gray hoodie with various logos and text, is sitting at a desk in front of a colorful background. He is using a laptop computer that has stickers and logos on it, including the AWS logo. The man appears to be presenting or speaking about AWS (Amazon Web Services) and its services, such as Lambda functions and large language models. He mentions that if a Lambda function can do something, then it can be used to augment a large language model. The man concludes by expressing hope that the viewer found the video useful and insightful, and encourages them to check out other videos on the AWS developers channel. He also asks viewers to like the video, subscribe to the channel, and watch other videos.\n\nThings to know\n\nAmazon Bedrock Data Automation is now available via cross-region inference in the following two AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon). When using Bedrock Data Automation from those Regions, data can be processed using cross-region inference in any of these four Regions: US East (Ohio, N. Virginia) and US West (N. California, Oregon). All these Regions are in the US so that data is processed within the same geography. We\u2019re working to add support for more Regions in Europe and Asia later in 2025.\n\nThere\u2019s no change in pricing compared to the preview and when using cross-region inference. For more information, visit Amazon Bedrock pricing.\n\nBedrock Data Automation now also includes a number of security, governance and manageability related capabilities such as AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys support for granular encryption control, AWS PrivateLink to connect directly to the Bedrock Data Automation APIs in your virtual private cloud (VPC) instead of connecting over the internet, and tagging of Bedrock Data Automation resources and jobs to track costs and enforce tag-based access policies in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).\n\nI used Python in this blog post but Bedrock Data Automation is available with any AWS SDKs. For example, you can use Java, .NET, or Rust for a backend document processing application; JavaScript for a web app that processes images, videos, or audio files; and Swift for a native mobile app that processes content provided by end users. It\u2019s never been so easy to get insights from multimodal data.\n\nHere are a few reading suggestions to learn more (including code samples):\n\n\u2013 Danilo\n\n\u2014\n\nHow is the News Blog doing?

            "content": "Today, A Better Balance filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Amazon, the online retail behemoth that has posted record profits this quarter, on behalf of Jessica*, a pregnant former warehouse associate in Virginia.\n\nThe charge details how Amazon repeatedly denied Jessica a reasonable accommodation for her high-risk pregnancy, forced her onto unpaid leave while she waited for an accommodation, and then fired her for missing work while on this forced leave.\n\nJessica\u2019s experiences highlight Amazon\u2019s use of abusive policies and practices that systematically violate warehouse workers\u2019 legal rights and threaten their health and safety. They also reveal Amazon\u2019s harmful use of technology and automated systems to outsource decisions, and to attempt to avoid legal responsibility for those decisions.\n\nJessica was hired at Amazon 17 weeks into her high-risk pregnancy. To protect her from life-threatening pregnancy complications, her doctors recommended a restriction on the amount of weight she could lift, and instructed her to refrain from repeatedly bending from a standing position \u2013 accommodations she is legally entitled to under the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. She dutifully went through Amazon\u2019s process to obtain an accommodation.\n\nImmediately, Jessica was assigned work that was hazardous and in violation of her documented limitations as a pregnant worker. For example, she was repeatedly ordered to bend and lift heavy boxes for grueling, 10-hour shifts, until she was in pain and feeling faint. On some assignments, Jessica was rated for performance based on how many heavy packages she could rapidly lift and sort per hour. When she protested, as an \u201calternative\u201d assignment, Jessica was instructed to clean with chemicals that were marked as unsafe for pregnant workers, and then denied protective equipment. When Jessica tried to appeal to HR, she was told that \u201cthe company\u2019s needs come first.\u201d\n\nAmazon repeatedly sent Jessica home for long periods of time without pay and then threatened her with discipline for racking up too many absence \u201cpoints.\u201d Ultimately, she received an automated email saying she was fired, and spent weeks in limbo while trying to appeal the decision or obtain an explanation. Eventually, fearing for her pregnancy and her own health, and having exhausted numerous attempts to request that Amazon accommodate her, Jessica was forced to leave her job. She faces a precarious financial situation as she is home without income while preparing to welcome a new child.\n\n\u201cJessica\u2019s situation lays bare how Amazon\u2019s systems are set up to violate the law,\u201d said Shyamala Ramakrishna, an attorney at A Better Balance. \u201cThrough this charge, we hope to affirm Jessica\u2019s rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act, which we allege Amazon violated. We also seek to hold Amazon accountable for a clear pattern of using its automated attendance system to punish workers who request accommodations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope my story enlightens Amazon of the unfair hurdles individuals with disabilities and those needing accommodation are forced to endure. I hope Amazon is willing to correct these obstacles for those in the future,\u201d said Jessica.\n\nA Better Balance has reason to believe that the treatment Jessica experienced highlights broader issues with Amazon\u2019s policies and practices. Pregnant workers and workers with disabilities who have experienced similar treatment at Amazon are encouraged to contact A Better Balance\u2019s free and confidential legal helpline.\n\n*Our client\u2019s name has been replaced with a pseudonym to protect her privacy.",

            "content": "Amazon just raised the walls of its walled garden.\n\nLast week, the company finally pulled back the curtain on its long-awaited Alexa overhaul, a chattier, more personalized and supposedly more useful version of its voice assistant. Generative AI powers this new version, called Alexa+, which is available beyond just Echo devices, spreading across car infotainment systems, connected TVs and anything else running Alexa.\n\nThis is Amazon\u2019s latest attempt to deliver on the grand vision it pitched a decade ago: making voice as intuitive for controlling devices as touch. So far it\u2019s been more gimmick than game-changer, but early reactions to this newest update suggest that could change. If it does, the bigger question isn\u2019t what Alexa can do, it is how Amazon plans to cash in.\n\nThere\u2019s already a glimpse into that playbook. Alexa+ is a subscription product priced at $19.99 a month, is free for Prime subscribers (Prime costs $14.99 a month), and costs even less with the annual plan (Prime annual fee is $139 per year). The strategy is clear: sweeten the Prime deal and make buying things even easier, so Alexa can help Amazon move more products. What\u2019s less clear is whether that plan extends to ads.\n\nSmart money says it will. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has made no secret of Amazon\u2019s growing reliance on advertising, given how the high-margin business has juiced profits. If Alexa becomes a bigger part of Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, it opens up even more real estate for ads, and another way for Amazon to turn conversation into commerce.\n\n\u201cWe think that there is a need to do it, from the perspective of Amazon\u2019s commercial partners,\u201d said Sue Benson, CEO and founder of The Behaviours Agency. \u201cBut there\u2019s also an opportunity for the brand from a consumer perspective for Amazon to continue to be at the forefront of satisfying their expectations. Thanks to the intimacy that Alexa affords.\u201d\n\nBenson\u2019s point cuts to a demand that\u2019s been building for a while now. Marketers want ads woven into the Alexa experience.\n\nUp until now, that\u2019s only happened in limited ways. For example, Amazon has already dipped its toe into ads on its smart display devices like Echo Show, as well as audio-based subscription recommendations on its smart speakers. Not only does that give Amazon the infrastructure for an ads business around Alexa, it\u2019s also provided a lot of intel on what is and isn\u2019t going to work with those ads, said Frank Maguire svp of product marketing and sustainability at Equativ company Sharethrough.\n\nShould Amazon pull the trigger on ads for Alexa+, marketers won\u2019t be lacking for reach. While the platform itself has not shared any recent figures, as of 2019, Amazon revealed that 100 million Alexa-powered devices had been sold. Additionally in the same year, Loup Ventures forecast that 75% of U.S. households would have smart speakers by 2025. Clearly, Amazon likely has at least enough users already to be able to experiment with more ads. The catch, though, is that Amazon has to tread carefully. Too many disruptions and those Alexa users might start tuning out.\n\nAs Maguire explained, such disruptions could really impact the perception of Amazon and the experience with one of its main physical products. \u201cJust because a company can, doesn\u2019t mean a brand should,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich is why Amazon is clearly opting to play the long game.\n\n\u201cThey [Amazon] recognize the risk of alienating audiences who have yet to see the full potential of voice assistants which have yet to be fully realized,\u201d said Joel Daly, co-founder of Artemis Ward. \u201cNot to mention privacy concerns \u2014 the combination of tailored advertising with the perceived invasiveness of always-listening voice devices can discourage adoption.\u201d\n\nAmazon declined to comment on this article.",

            "content": "Over the summer, Amazon reduced the number of drone flights. In November, it fully adopted newer, quieter drones in College Station that deliver within a range of about 7.5 miles. Inside his house, with the double-paned windows shut and TV on, Smith could no longer hear the drones. More recently, wet winter weather has further restricted the frequency of flights. (Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson says the drones are approved to fly in light rain and all forms of aviation are impacted by extreme weather.)\n\nBut things finally went back to fully normal for Smith and other residents of the woodsy communities near Amazon\u2019s drone base in January, when the company temporarily grounded its drones nationwide for a software update process that is ongoing. Amazon plans to end its College Station lease on September 30, potentially giving the frustrated communities permanent quiet.\n\nIf Amazon had conducted the maximum number of flights outlined in its plans reviewed by the FAA, a drone might have buzzed by Smith\u2019s house about every 58 seconds for 15 hours a day. Now, he hasn\u2019t seen one in weeks.\n\nResidents say they have noticed wildlife return to the area. Paul Greer, who lives near the drone depot, says he heard an owl for the first time in months. Deer also are more abundant with the drones gone, he says. Even Greer\u2019s dog, George, is at peace. Seeing and hearing the drones during walks agitated his 50-pound bull terrier. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expected the noise to be as invasive as it has been,\u201d Greer says.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Stephenson reiterates that the FAA review determined that the operations would not have a significant impact on wildlife and says that College Station officials conducted a test that found the drones operated below the city\u2019s noise limits. \u201cWe work hard to listen to the community and to mitigate any potential impact from our operations,\u201d Stephenson says. Since the company launched its new MK30 drone, he says, it hasn\u2019t \u201creceived any community complaints, and the feedback from local officials has been positive.\u201d\n\nSome of the College Station residents who have complained about the noise say they still largely support the testing of drones. But many believe Amazon miscalculated by locating its depot close to so many residences. The company\u2019s first depot\u2014now shut down\u2014was located near businesses and vineyards in rural California. Its third and newest location is at one of its warehouses in a quiet Arizona town. A planned site in the UK is also based at a fulfillment center and largely bounded by fields and industrial parks. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should ban this,\u201d Smith says of drone delivery. \u201cIf there\u2019s a place for it, and the market needs it, then fine, but it shouldn\u2019t mess up the peace in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s drone sector rivals, such as DroneUp and Alphabet\u2019s Wing, have made many more deliveries, mostly by operating out of commercial areas and forming partnerships with physical retailers. That\u2019s not so easy for Amazon, the nation\u2019s dominant online shopping platform. It has plenty of logistics warehouses, but they\u2019re not necessarily located close enough to customers for delivery drones to reach them.\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nAmazon has said little about how it chose the location of its College Station drone hub, which it began leasing in 2022. Residents such as Smith believe privacy may have played a role. The building Amazon leased is tucked away behind trees, limiting what might be visible to prying eyes. Stephenson, the Amazon spokesperson, says its choice of location involved \u201cthorough analysis of the area\u201d and \u201cclose collaboration with local leaders.\u201d\n\nSmith says that during a series of community events Amazon hosted in 2022, some College Station residents were miffed by how the company highlighted cookies rather than urgent necessities as items Prime Air could deliver. He and others also asked to see the drones in action to gauge how loud they might be, but the company refused. \u201cWe ended up getting it without actually hearing it,\u201d he says. Amazon\u2019s Stephenson says that the demonstrations weren\u2019t possible, because the FAA didn\u2019t approve the drones to take flight until the end of the year when commercial operations began.",

            "content": "House Bill 1839 would bring in over $200 million a year for higher education in by closing a tax loophole benefiting Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nIn the recent February 11 election, Seattle voters backed social housing in a landslide and roundly defeated the attempt by Amazon and Microsoft to block a tax on excessive compensation exceeding $1 million annually. The tax was designed to catalyze mixed-income integrated affordable housing for Seattle residents and workers and garnered a landslide 26-point victory.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft each donated $100,000 to back Proposition 1B, which was engineered by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to derail the grassroots social housing measure and the tax that funded it. Microsoft president Brad Smith contributed $10,000 of his own money to defeat affordable housing for workers just last month.\n\nTech billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk look on for the Trump inauguration ceremony they spent millions to help fund. (Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies)\n\nNow is a good time to shine a spotlight on the tax benefits that these two Trump-genuflecting companies have lobbied for themselves. In so doing, they have extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the state of Washington, depriving the citizens of our state of educational opportunity.\n\nAn education surtax with an Amazon and Microsoft loophole\n\nIn 2019, the Washington State Legislature considered a surtax on businesses which benefited from the education of tech-savvy workers. The tax intended to fund workforce education to train Washington students for Washington jobs.\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon were all onboard. Brad Smith, authored an op-ed in the Seattle Times proposing to increase the business and occupation tax rate for these businesses from 1.5% to 1.8% and even more so that the \u201clargest tech companies would pay somewhat more than the 1.8 percent rate.\u201d In the original legislation, this would have created a 2.5% tax on Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nAll the Democrats were on board, and the legislation sailed through the House Finance Committee. But something funky and hidden was inserted into the bill along the way, thanks to the efforts of a newly resigned Democratic state senator, Guy Palumbo, who then went to work for Amazon\u2019s lobbying shop. The amendment, approved by Democrats, capped the surcharge for businesses with more than $25 billion in receipts at $7 million (later amended to $9 million in 2020).\n\nTwo companies were the primary beneficiaries: Amazon and Microsoft. Their total haul from this loophole was estimated at more than $460 million between 2019 and 2025.\n\nProposition 1A backers gathered at the Amazon Spheres to highlight the flood of cash from the region\u2019s large corporations, including Amazon, promoting alternative Proposition 1B that sought to block social housing. (Ryan Packer)\n\nNow, State Representative Julia Reed (D-36th, Ballard) wants to close this Amazon/Microsoft tax loophole. Her bill, HB 1839, simply eliminates the loophole. This would bring in over $200 million a year for higher education. With that, the state could reduce tuition across the board by $530 per student, and expand the college grant so that it actually helps middle class students.\n\nA crisis in college enrollment\n\nWe have a funding crisis in higher education while Washington faces a projected shortfall of nearly 600,000 credentialed workers over the decade. However, undergraduate enrollment has dropped since 2019 by 83,000 students. That means that Washington has one fifth fewer students now than six years ago. One major barrier to enrollment is rising tuition. Since 2019, average net price to students at Washington\u2019s public institutions has increased by nearly $2,500, a 26% jump.\n\nDemocrats patted themselves on the back with the inception of the college grant program, saying this program helps out middle class students with tuition. It has been rhetoric, not reality. Full tuition through the College Grant program is only for students with family incomes up to 60% of the state\u2019s median income \u2013 no more than $67,000 for a family of three. If your family income is 91% of the median, you receive a 10% discount on tuition. If your family is right in the middle, you get nothing. No wonder enrollment is dropping.\n\nWill the legislature act on this? So often these past five years I have heard legislators defend the loophole for Amazon and Microsoft by saying \u201cwe made a deal\u201d for their support. So they might just continue to coddle Amazon, with its profits increasing from $225 billion in 2022 to over $311 billion in 2024 and Microsoft, with its profits increasing from $135 billion to $171 billion. These are the companies that stood behind Donald Trump and funded his inauguration festivities. They are the oligarchs that seek to circumvent democracy.\n\nWe should put democracy first. It will make a lot more sense to have a deal with the voters and students and future students of our state, by closing this egregious loophole for corporate oligarchs.",

            "content": "Without the ability of a prophet, no one can know what will happen in a year. But some stocks have been around long enough and have a steady enough business to be able to make a decent guess as to where they might be a year from now. I think that last year, a lot of people could have predicted that Amazon (AMZN 1.17%) would be where it is today, more or less.\n\nRegardless of the fine points about where it will be next year, one thing to be fairly confident about is that Amazon has a long growth runway, and its stock is a reliable long-term winner. With that in mind, let's see what's happening at Amazon and where it could be at this time next year.\n\n1. Improvements in e-commerce\n\nAmazon operates many businesses today, but its core business is still e-commerce. Online store sales and third-party sales together accounted for 65% of the total in the 2024 fourth quarter, a sizable majority. This is Amazon's bread and butter, and it consistently upgrades the platform, adding new products and speeding up delivery times. It expanded its same-day delivery sites by 60% in 2024, including 140 U.S. metro areas.\n\nAt the same time, it's also working to optimize the fulfillment network, and improvements have meaningfully contributed to the operating income increases. It's focusing on its inbound distribution channels, or how it gets products into its regional distribution centers. The more availability in these centers, the faster it can get a shipment to any customer in the country.\n\nAlmost a year ago, I imagined where Amazon would be now, and I predicted that Amazon would have a greater product assortment, improve the speed of its delivery times, and possibly capture greater market share. It has done the first two quite well, and the third is up for debate; there are varying figures as to how much of the e-commerce market Amazon controls, although they claim around the 40% mark. I think it will improve in all of these areas again in another year. Amazon hasn't given a recent update about Prime customer numbers, but that number is likely to keep rising.\n\n2. Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and on the cloud\n\nThe part of Amazon that's gotten the market excited recently is generative AI, of course, and that's mostly on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. CEO Andy Jassy constantly talks about the staggering opportunity in AI and how Amazon is positioning itself to benefit from a shift to the cloud, where clients can do the most with the available AI tools. Amazon is the global leader in cloud computing and is investing more than $100 billion in AI this year.\n\nJassy has taken over Jeff Bezos' role as Amazon's visionary leader, and he sees a future where AI is built into every new app and program, like storage and databases are the building blocks today. The AI piece is going to be built on the cloud, \"with the largest portion of it on AWS.\" Amazon has a partnership with Nvidia, but it's also creating its own chips to handle AI workloads at a budget-friendly price, in addition to the software tools available to AWS customers.\n\nAWS was back to being the fastest-growing Amazon segment, accelerating to a 19% year-over-year sales increase in the fourth quarter.\n\nOne thing to note is that Jassy cautioned that growth is going to be lumpy over the next few years. The market never likes that, but expect some quarters to be better than others, and plan for Amazon stock to reflect that.\n\n3. New ventures and businesses\n\nLast year, I suggested that Amazon could have some new businesses or other surprises, but that wasn't really the case over the past year. Instead, Amazon concentrated its investments in AI and in upgrading its existing businesses.\n\nAdvertising remains a growth business for Amazon, although it fell to second place as Amazon's fastest-growing segment behind AWS, with an 18% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Don't take that the wrong way -- it has a $69 billion run rate, up from $29 billion four years ago, and its new Prime video ad-supported network is progressing well.\n\nAs Amazon invests in the massive opportunity of its generative AI business, I can see it continuing this trajectory of focusing on it in place of finding the next big thing; it already has the next big thing. I envision more updates to all of its businesses, with expansion into areas on the back burner for now.",

In the fourth episode, we visited \u201cThe Amazon,\u201d one of the most impressive environments on the planet.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Americas Sundays at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nIt\u2019s the world\u2019s largest rainforest, containing the world\u2019s largest river, home to giant snakes, pink river dolphins, and more biological diversity than anywhere else on Earth. The Amazon covers nearly half of South America, fed by the vast Amazon River. Alongside the hidden turtle nesting grounds, troupes of hunting river otters, and swarms of destructive army ants, you\u2019ll find the Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on the planet.\n\nThe Pantanal is the world\u2019s largest tropical wetland, fed by a sky river of clouds\n\nThe Pantanal Wetlands in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Photo: Natphotos/Getty Images\n\nWhile the Amazon River gets all of the attention for holding 15 percent of the world\u2019s fresh water, there\u2019s an even larger source of water flowing overhead. The dense vegetation of the forest pulls water from the earth, then breathes it out as water vapor. Some of that water falls back down to the forest as rain but the rest of it spreads into the wider environment.\n\nThe forest creates a river of clouds in the sky, carrying water all over South America. Those rains provide fresh water to millions of people and create the Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland in the world. It\u2019s a vast collection of shallow lakes, marshes, grasslands, and forests 20 times the size of the Florida Everglades.\n\nRELATED: NBC Nature Docuseries The Americas Announces a Making Of Peacock Special (DETAILS)\n\nThe exact size of the Pantanal varies throughout the year, swelling to roughly 75,000 square miles during the rainy season. It supports more than 250 species of fish, 650 species of birds, and a wide variety of terrestrial animals including tapirs, marsh deer, howler and capuchin monkeys, capybaras, giant anteaters, and more.\n\nEvery year torrential rains flood the Pantanal, filling the landscape with fresh water. Later, when the rains subside, water drains into the Paraguay river. Isolated pools of fish and snails get left behind, attracting birds and other predators, including 15-foot anaconda, elegant jaguars, and an estimated 4 million yacare caiman.\n\nThe submarine singing of the Pantanal\u2019s yacare caiman\n\nA Caiman Crocodile in Pantanal, Brasil. Photo: Jami Tarris/Getty Images\n\nMost of the time, adult yacare caiman are solitary, but during the rainy season they gather by the thousands to mate. The males grow to between 6 and 10 feet and weigh approximately 100 pounds, fully grown. Females are comparatively smaller, growing to about 5 feet long and weighing between 30 and 45 pounds. They are notable for brown scaly skin and small dark marks across the body.\n\nRELATED: The Americas Narrator Tom Hanks is Full of Nature Facts: \"I'm the Greatest Dinner Companion\"\n\nDuring mating season, males fight over shallow water territory, looking for the best place to make their mating display. Once they find a spot they like, the show begins. With their bodies underwater, males generate low-frequency roars. Sound waves travel through the water, making the surface dance in a parade of droplets, and the spectacle draws the attention of females.\n\nIf the performance is good enough, they wrap themselves around one another and mate. The female builds a nest made of mud and vegetation, then lays her eggs, usually between 20 and 35. Once the babies hatch they\u2019re on their own, feeding and defending themselves from day one. If they survive the wilderness of the Pantanal to maturity, they\u2019ll come back here themselves to find their own dance partner.\n\nWhere to Watch The Americas\n\nThe Americas debuted with a special two-part premiere on Sunday February 23, at 7:00 p.m. ET. Viewers were treated to a documentary double feature two weeks in a row, following a schedule change. New episodes will air weekly on Sundays at 8:00 pm ET and will be streaming on Peacock the following day!",

She returned this weekend as an instructor assistant and a freshman in college.\n\n\"We don\u2019t really have as much representation and spaces where we get to explore our stem principles, so this is a really unique space for us to express our voices and ideas and, I think especially for young girls who might feel those stereotypes in high school or middle school, this is a way for them to break out of that,\" Aditi said.\n\nShe\u2019s referring to the gender gap in the tech industry.

Which books are featured in Amazon First Reads? Do you need a Kindle for Amazon First Reads?\n\nThere's a lot to enjoy with an Amazon Prime membership: a plentiful streaming service full of acclaimed originals, same-day shipping, and Grubhub+. But that's just a sampling of the extensive benefits for members. Prime members who also happen to be bookworms can maximize their monthly reading with the Amazon First Reads program.\n\nSimilar to Book of the Month, every month, Amazon First Reads drops a new collection of discounted titles. However, unlike Book of the Month, these books are totally free for Prime Members. Here's everything you need to know about Amazon First Reads.\n\nWhat is Amazon First Reads?\n\nAmazon First Reads is a monthly program in which eight editor-selected books are offered free to Prime members. Members are allowed to choose one book per month, which is then added to their library. Non-Prime members can still join in on the fun, but they have to pay $1.99 per book.\n\nFeatured Amazon First Reads books are totally free at checkout for Prime members. Credit: Screenshot: Amazon / Mashable composite\n\nSome months, like Prime Day's July and Black Friday's November, offer two free books. And in others, you can select a free short story with your one free e-book.\n\nTo select your book, visit the Amazon First Reads home page to browse the options. As a Prime Member, you'll see the option to \"read now for free \" when you go to purchase the titles. Once you make your selection, it'll automatically be added to your Kindle library.\n\nMashable Top Stories Stay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.

The books are typically new or soon-to-be-released books \u2014 many of the books are published under one of Amazon's publishing imprints, so they're exclusive to Amazon's shelves.\n\nIn addition to the eight full-length books offered each month, there's typically a short story available, too, exclusive to read through the Kindle Store. You'll find familiar names in the First Reads collections. Past authors include Abby Jimenez, Rebecca Yarros, Lee Child, Fredrik Backman, Alice Hoffman, and Dean Koontz.\n\nKindle Unlimited members are able to read most of the previous First Reads picks for free, so if there are multiple each month that you want to add to your digital bookshelf, consider a Kindle Unlimited membership.\n\nDo you need a Kindle for Amazon First Reads?\n\nAll of the books selected are technically purchased through the Kindle Store. But does that mean you need a Kindle to read them?\n\nNope! No Kindle e-reader is necessary to read books collected through First Reads. All books purchased through the Kindle Store are available in the Kindle app, which can be read on a smartphone, tablet, or computer.\n\nHowever, if you're asking if you should get a Kindle, that's a different question. While a Kindle is not required to enjoy the bounty of the Kindle store, it is our favorite e-reader brand if you're in the market.",

            "content": "Amazon on Friday lost a fight to escape regulatory oversight for a proposed data center northwest of Minneapolis, in a skirmish that illustrates how the tech industry\u2019s rush to invest billions in new facilities can clash with local communities and state-level climate goals. The decision against Amazon by Minnesota\u2019s Public Utilities Commission comes in a state that, like many others, is grappling with a recent spike in data center construction, with projects also planned by Meta and Microsoft.\n\nTech industry competition in artificial intelligence is driving a boom in data center construction that won support from the Biden administration and now the Trump administration. The projects have prompted the resurrection of shuttered power plants and fears of rate hikes and energy shortfalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Minnesota, Amazon sought to avoid a potentially lengthy permitting process for 250 diesel backup generators at a data center proposed in the small city of Becker, where the project had support from labor unions and city officials.\n\nThe company argued it should be exempt from a rule requiring extra oversight of power generation projects \u2014 including scrutiny of emissions and pollution \u2014 because it is not a utility and the generators will not be connected to the grid.\n\nKatie Sieben, chair of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, disagreed in a hearing on Friday. She said Amazon should go though the \u201ccertificate of need\u201d process that state law requires, because it would help decide questions including whether diesel generators were appropriate or if alternatives, such as using biodiesel, would be better.\n\nThe commission unanimously voted against Amazon\u2019s petition, while allowing the company to sidestep specific data requests in the law irrelevant for its project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Amazon\u2019s exemption request was denied, the company is working to pass a state bill also supported by the industry group Data Center Coalition that would accomplish the same goal by changing the underlying Minnesota law.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the clarity provided by the Public Utility Commission today regarding our request and the regulatory framework and requirements related to backup generation,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe remain committed to working collaboratively with state leaders to determine the best path forward for any future projects.\u201d\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nSarah Mooradian, policy director for the environmental nonprofit CURE MN, one of the environmental groups that opposed Amazon\u2019s request, said the group was pleased with Friday\u2019s decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if an energy source isn\u2019t directly connected to the grid, it still has huge impacts that need to be examined and questioned, especially at the scale we\u2019re talking about with hyperscale data centers,\u201d she wrote in a statement.\n\nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission also held a separate hearing this week about possible real estate speculation in the Amazon deal, and the state legislature held hearings on tax incentives for data centers.\n\nBecker is home to a coal-fired power plant scheduled to shut down next year that has in recent years brought in more than three-quarters of the city\u2019s tax revenue.\n\nThe Becker city officials and local labor unions that support Amazon\u2019s proposal and a Microsoft data center planned in the city have also testified in favor of the state bill that would reduce regulation on such projects\u2019 backup generators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut elsewhere in Minnesota, residents and environmental activists are concerned about removing regulatory obstacles for the data center industry.\n\nMeta is working on a large data center in Rosemount, on the south edge of Minneapolis. A data center developer called Tract is planning a similar project on a golf course seven miles down the road in Farmington.\n\nA group of residents who have dubbed themselves the Coalition for Responsible Data Center Development have sued the city of Farmington in hopes of pausing the development.\n\nCathy Johnson, a leader of the group who has testified against tax cuts and regulatory shortcuts for data centers, said the group got help from citizens who halted data center developments in Peculiar, Missouri, and Burns Harbor, Indiana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson said she\u2019s worried that Minnesota\u2019s government doesn\u2019t have enough information about the data centers popping up all over the state \u2014 as many as 10, according to a Minnesota Star Tribune analysis.\n\n\u201cI wish the state would do a moratorium, slow down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are problems in other states, and I don\u2019t think Minnesota is paying close enough attention.\u201d\n\nThe backup generators that data centers need to keep operating during power outages have become a flash point for local opposition to the projects.\n\nAmazon argued before the Public Utilities Commission that generators are crucial, because hospitals and other critical infrastructure depend on its data centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company said the generators would operate only in emergencies and during routine testing. In documents filed to the commission, Amazon said the 250 generators in Becker would run less than 15 hours per year.\n\nHudson Kingston, a legal director of CURE MN, said there are still reasons to be concerned.\n\n\u201cDiesel generators are diesel motors \u2014 it\u2019s like having a giant new train yard in your community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people of Becker don\u2019t deserve to have another giant ground-level pollution source, even if it only runs a few days a year.\u201d\n\nKingston said Amazon could in practice run its generators for longer and that they will increase the state\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nGenerators at data centers have also caught the notice of regulators or met opposition in other states.\n\nEnvironmental groups have protested the use of generators at a data center in Memphis built by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI for artificial intelligence development. Microsoft got permission from state environmental regulators in Wisconsin to add at least 40 generators to a data center after agreeing to add pollution-reducing technology, according to Wisconsin Public Radio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaryland, meanwhile, passed a law last year making it easier for data centers to get approval to use the generators.\n\nAmazon said it will continue to work with lawmakers in Minnesota and is \u201cconstantly evaluating new locations based on customer demand.\u201d\n\nPublic Utilities Commissioner John Tuma said Friday in remarks opposing Amazon\u2019s request that he hoped the generator permitting process would include discussion of alternative energy sources.",

            "content": "Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nAmazon has been focused on bringing generative AI to Alexa for the past few years, hitting multiple delays in launching new features that the company first announced in September 2023. The delayed Alexa 2.0 was poised for a 2025 release, and Amazon held a late February event where it made big announcements for the artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant.\n\nAmid rumors of Alexa 2.0 shortcomings, Amazon skipped its 2024 Devices and Services event, where the company typically announces new Alexa features and hardware devices. Instead, it unveiled Alexa+ last month, the voice assistant's generative AI features, and finally put an ETA on its launch.\n\nAlso: 7 exciting AI features coming with Alexa+ (and what Amazon devices support it)\n\n\"Up until a couple of years ago, it was pretty difficult to invent with AI, and that changed with the arrival of foundational models and generative AI. This made the technology much more accessible, so people can see the power and magic of what generative AI can do,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said.\n\nThe event, which took place on Feb. 26 in New York City, was Panos Panay's first since joining the Devices and Services division after his Microsoft exit. In addition to new Alexa features, Amazon also made other announcements.\n\nEverything announced at Amazon's February 2025 event\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nGenerative AI in Alexa+\n\nGiving Alexa the power of generative AI was already expected to be the star announcement from Amazon -- and it was. During the last Devices and Services event in 2023, Amazon announced a gen AI-powered 'Alexa+' or Alexa Plus and a new user interface coming to an Echo device near you, and the company is now making it more real than ever before.\n\nPanay likened the evolution of Alexa and its obstacle-ridden road toward generative AI to a symphony warming up before a concert and how the conductor raises the baton to transform \"disconnected sounds into a masterpiece.\"\n\nAlexa+ will reply with a more natural cadence, handle multiple prompts in a session, and generate content instead of providing canned answers to questions. It will also feature greater customization power to remember user preferences (think like ChatGPT's Memory) for more productive user interactions, learning \"the rhythm of your life,\" according to Panay.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa+ initially - see if yours made the list\n\nAside from all of this, Alexa+ has contextual awareness, so it can hold long conversations and remember what you asked before your last questions instead of giving canned responses from Alexa Answers contributors. As Amazon demoed, it can also read and process documents for you to answer questions, like school calendars or an HOA CC&R document.\n\nAlexa+ launch date\n\nThe new Alexa+ will begin rolling out next month to some users in an early access manner, with a gradual rollout after that.\n\nAmazon said little about the new Alexa after the 2023 event, with rumors suggesting that the company was repeatedly forced to delay its gen AI launch due to deficient performance. Thankfully, Amazon seems to have finally smoothed out its Alexa 2.0.\n\nWhile Alexa dominates the US market for virtual assistants, preferred by two-thirds of Americans, it has also recently fallen behind other assistants, including Google and, most recently, Siri. The release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in recent years triggered a tidal wave of generative AI that pushed other virtual assistants ashore. At the same time, Alexa appears to have sunk to the bottom of the ocean -- until now.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa+ for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe new breed of gen AI-powered virtual assistants -- ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot powered by OpenAI's technologies, Google Assistant-powered by Gemini, and Siri powered by Apple LLMs -- have surged ahead in the past two years. We can only wait to see how well the new Alexa+, powered by Amazon Bedrock models, including Nova and Anthropic, will perform in real-world scenarios.\n\nAlexa+ subscription tiers\n\nAmazon's Alexa+ will work behind a subscription service that will cost $20 monthly but will be free for Prime subscribers. A subscription-based system has been rumored for about a year, so this didn't come as a surprise, but the rumors said it was planned to cost between $5-$10 monthly, not $20. At this cost, Alexa+ is the same price as a ChatGPT Plus subscription.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots\n\nThe \"Classic Alexa\" will still be available for users who prefer not to pay the monthly fee, though it's not known how long Amazon plans to maintain the current version.\n\nA new Echo Show user interface\n\nAmazon also announced a new revamped platform for the Echo Show with the launch of Alexa+. The new look in the Echo Show interface seems like it will be available in the larger Echo Show displays for now. Alexa+ will also have integrations with your Ring subscriptions to provide a new experience on the Echo Show.\n\nAlso: The best Alexa devices\n\nThe redesigned Echo Show user interface features a sleeker layout for your favorite widgets and a cohesive look throughout the screen. Alexa+ is bringing adaptive display to the large Echo Show devices, the Echo Show 15 and Echo Show 21, to show a simplified view from afar that transitions to a customized screen when you approach the device.",

            "content": "The Amazon Basin includes the largest rainforest in the world, an estimated 10% of all terrestrial species, and around 20% of global river water discharged to oceans1. In addition, the Amazon rainforest stores an estimated 86 PgC, which is equivalent to close to 10 years of current global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (\\(\\hbox {CO}_2\\)) emissions2. In recent decades, as a result of deforestation and forest degradation, regions of the Amazon rainforest have become sources of \\(\\hbox {CO}_2\\), emitting an estimated 0.03-0.5 PgC per year1,3,4. Due to regional climate change, observed increases in drought frequency and severity may further disrupt areas of the rainforest and lead to decreased carbon uptake and increased tree mortality. While significant uncertainty exists, the details of the tropical forest response to future climate forcings require renewed attention5,6.\n\nThe Amazon is highly vulnerable to droughts, which may increase as a result of increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns7. Significant drought events, such as those in 2005 and 2010, have resulted in reduced precipitation that could lead to decreased biomass accumulation and increased carbon flux out of the region8. Therefore, changes to precipitation in the region have the potential to cause significant impacts on the climate system. Understanding the background state and trends of precipitation in the Amazon Basin are key aspects to understanding the role of the rainforest and its impact on the global climate system.\n\nGlobal forecast models and reanalyses have historically struggled to represent tropical precipitation patterns9,10. Costa and Foley (1998)11 explored differences between the datasets available at that time, including rain gauge measurements, satellite information, and reanalysis products, and found significant differences in inter-annual variability between the various datasets. Lavers et al. (2022)12 identified issues that are still present in the ERA5 (ECMWF [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts] Reanalysis \\(5^{\\textrm{th}}\\) Generation) reanalysis. They found that precipitation values do not correlate well with station observations in the tropics, including the Amazon Basin. Although the data sets available today have changed a great deal by incorporating a large number of new observational sites, adding new satellite-based measurements, and incorporating increased model resolution, significant differences still remain.\n\nGiven the challenges identified above, quantifying discrepancies between the reanalysis data and available observations is an important step for projections of climate change in the Amazon Basin, especially for modeling other changes to the region, such as ecosystem responses. Dos Santos Silva et al. (2023)13 compared several observational and reanalysis datasets, and found a general pattern of negative bias compared to observations within the Brazilian portion of the Basin. Other studies e.g.14,15,16,17 assessed historical precipitation patterns and trends using the ERA5 reanalysis. However, in certain seasons and subregions in the Amazon Basin, we find that the ERA5 reanalyses do not accurately represent the trends in precipitation compared to the observationally-based datasets, particularly during June, July, and August (JJA) (see \u201cSection Spatial trends in annual precipitation\u201d).\n\nAnnual precipitation varies widely within the Amazon Basin, from over 3,000 mm in the northern regions to around 1,000 mm in the southern regions (Fig. 1). Similar to many tropical regions, the Amazon experiences distinct wet and dry seasons, though the timing and the duration of those seasons varies from north to south across the region, with the northern (\\(5^\\circ\\)N\u2013\\(5^\\circ\\)S) wet season falling from May to September, and the southern (\\(5^\\circ\\)S\u2013\\(15^\\circ\\)S) wet season occurring from October to March.\n\nFig. 1 Spatial distribution of average annual precipitation (units: mm per year) in the Amazon Basin during the period 1980 to 2022. The averages are computed using the CHIRPS dataset. The Amazon Basin is outlined in black. Full size image\n\nLocated on the western edge of the Amazon Basin, Los Andes mountains serve as an effective boundary to Pacific moisture reaching the Basin. As a result, for most of the year, nearly all of the moisture entering the Amazon Basin comes from the north or east, from the Atlantic and Caribbean18. The prevailing wind shifts throughout the year, from north-easterly throughout the Basin during the Austral summer, to primarily easterly, with north and south components along Los Andes from June to August19. During these months, a significant portion of the moisture comes from the South Atlantic20. The rainy seasons mirror these changes, with the maximum in precipitation shifting from the northeast in July and August to the southwest in January and February. However, while all subregions of the Basin experience a seasonal cycle in precipitation, the dry season is much more pronounced in the southwest, where limited amounts of precipitation falls between June and September18.\n\nMoisture recycling within the Basin plays a key role in the precipitation distribution throughout the Amazon21,22. Under the influence of adequate soil moisture levels, the rainforest canopy is very effective at evapotranspiration, leading to a much higher evaporation rate than most over-land regions23,24,25. As a result, in the southern and western portions of the Amazon Basin, a large percentage of the precipitation is derived from moisture that was evapotranspired from elsewhere in the region, with studies estimating the recycling ratio to range from 25 to 35%22,26. The prevalence of moisture recycling increases the likelihood of positive feedback cycles, where in the long run the decreases in rainfall can lead to decreased rainforest extent, which in turn further reduces rainfall27,28. This cycle may also be initiated by deforestation, and several studies have indicated that areas of widespread deforestation have resulted in precipitation decreases in downwind regions3,29. Moisture recycling from the Amazon is also important for La Plata river basin, downstream of the Amazon, providing much of the moisture for precipitation in that region20.\n\nIn this study, we examine the historical precipitation data from several sources to identify the regions and seasons within the Amazon Basin with the best and worst agreement between the observational and reanalysis datasets. This study seeks to address several related research questions:",

They have the smooth feel of my Lululemon Align leggings and the structured feel of my Athleta Brooklyn pants (both retail for around $100). They are also extremely lightweight, almost to the point that I feel like I'm practically wearing nothing.\n\nI went on a trail walk the other day and felt comfortable \u2014 throughout the elevation and temperature changes \u2014 the whole time. I barely broke a sweat, and I also loved knowing pesky mosquitoes couldn\u2019t get to my legs. And since the pants have UPF 50 protection, I wasn\u2019t worried about any sun damage while walking on the sunnier parts of the trail either.\n\nContributing writer Hannah Hynes wearing her Baleaf joggers. Courtesy Hannah Hynes\n\nI'm officially a fan of zipper pockets\n\nThese joggers helped change my tune on the usefulness of zipper pockets. The pair features five of them, which may seem a bit much, but they don't feel bulky at all and have proved to be truly game-changing details.\n\nLast month, I was at a four-year-old\u2019s birthday party and found myself in one of those multi-story jungle gyms, playing with my son. All was well until we made it to the bottom and I realized my phone was no longer in my pocket. I backtracked my steps and luckily found it, but that anxiety could have been avoided if I had just been wearing these pants.\n\nThey're ideal for keeping your valuables safe while on a walk or while jumping at a trampoline park with your children. It\u2019s a relief knowing I won\u2019t have to dig through a ball pit to find my car keys from now on.\n\nThey're more versatile than you think\n\nThese pants aren\u2019t just for exercising and can be styled in so many different ways. Pair them with casual sneakers, ballet flats, or sandals and a denim blouse to run errands or for work. They're also stretchy and cute enough to go straight from yoga to brunch.\n\nHynes hitting a yoga pose in her Baleaf joggers. Courtesy Hannah Hynes\n\nWhat to consider\n\nThe pants come in black, blue, red, khaki, gray, and green and have two inseam options (regular and petite). I ordered a size medium with 28\u201d regular inseam. For reference, I am 5\u20197\u201d and usually order a M. They hit right at my ankle and the bands weren\u2019t uncomfortably tight. The waistband is very stretchy and adjustable, but I was able to slip the pants on without untying the string, and they stayed nice and snug while I wore them.\n\nThe material is a mix of nylon and spandex and hand washing is recommended. But, full disclosure, I put mine in the washer and dryer, and I didn\u2019t notice any pilling.\n\nMore joggers to shop\n\nWillit Cargo Joggers\n\nColors: 8 | Sizes: XS-3XL | Fabric: 51% nylon, 46% viscose, 3% spandex\n\nColors: 5 | Sizes: XS-4X | Fabric: 77% recycled polyester, 23% spandex (Interior waistband: 77% nylon, 23% spandex)\n\nColors: 3 | Sizes: S-XL | Fabric: 85% polyester, 15% spandex\n\nWhy trust Shop TODAY?\n\nThe Shop TODAY editors and writers search the internet to find the best products out there.

Although strategy consultants have honed these skills, many knowledge workers lack them due to inadequate training and limited access to appropriate tools. Developing these skills not only enhances individual productivity but also drives significant benefits for the organization.\n\nBusiness use cases\n\nIn this post, we want to demonstrate some additional generative AI use cases on Amazon Bedrock. We show how Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock can be used for a variety of business-related cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving, critical thinking and ideation\u2014to help augment human thinking and improve decision-making among knowledge workers to accelerate innovation. For this, we are using several frameworks and tools widely used by the management consulting community, such as mutually exclusively collectively exhaustive (MECE); strengths, weakness, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis, issue tree, value chain analysis and value driver tree analysis.\n\nSolution overview\n\nTo demonstrate these five use cases, we used the Amazon Bedrock playground with Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 LLM. Where necessary, in addition to text prompts, we also used Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5\u2019s image-to-text capability to improve the accuracy of the responses generated.\n\nExplanation of the five use cases\u2014together with the prompts and images used to feed the LLM and the responses generated\u2014are shown in the following sections. To improve the explicability of text responses generated by the LLM, we\u2019ve provided additional diagrams, where necessary, to complement each LLM response (for example, the tree diagram corresponding to the LLM generated response).\n\nThe following sections explain the solution flow for each use case.\n\nMECE\n\nMECE is a widely used framework for business problem-solving. MECE helps break down a problem into well-defined, nonoverlapping parts (mutually exclusive), but when all the parts are taken together, they\u2019re comprehensive and exhaustive to address the entirety of the problem (collectively exhaustive).\n\nIn this example, we want to demonstrate the use of the MECE principle by asking the LLM to arrange food items (in this case, various fried rice options) listed in a restaurant menu, adhering to the MECE guidelines.\n\nWe provided the following prompt to the LLM:\n\nHere are some fried rice options: chicken fried rice, vegetable fried rice, lamb fried rice, beef cried rice, egg fried rice, prawn fried rice, squid fried rice Can you please arrange them using MECE (Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive) principle?\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM:\n\nWe arranged the LLM response in tree format for visual clarity, as shown in the following diagram.\n\nSuppose the restaurant wants to add three more varieties to the menu: egg and prawn fried rice, lamb and prawn fried rice, and vegan fried rice. We sought the help of the LLM with the following prompt to rearrange the menu while preserving the MECE principle:\n\nI want to add 3 more varieties to the menu: egg and prawn fried rice, lamb and prawn fried rice, vegan fried rice. Can you please rearrange the list in MECE?\n\nWe get the following modified response from the LLM:\n\nWe rearranged the LLM response in tree format for visual clarity. As shown in the following diagram, the LLM has preserved the MECE principle, intelligently adding new categories as needed to accommodate the menu changes.\n\nIssue tree\n\nAn issue tree, also known as a logic tree or problem-solving tree, is a strategic analytical tool used to deconstruct complex problems into their constituent elements. This hierarchical framework facilitates a systematic approach to problem-solving by:\n\nDisaggregating the primary issue into discrete, manageable subcomponents\n\nOrganizing these elements in a structured, top-down format\n\nProviding comprehensive coverage through the application of the MECE principle\n\nThe visual representation afforded by an issue tree enables stakeholders to:\n\nIdentify key drivers and root causes\n\nPrioritize areas for further investigation or resource allocation\n\nMaintain a holistic view of the problem while focusing on specific aspects\n\nBy employing this methodology, organizations can enhance their decision-making processes, streamline strategic planning, and improve the efficiency of their problem-solving endeavors.\n\nTo demonstrate the LLM\u2019s ability to solve problems using an issue tree, we used a fictitious company\u2014AnyCompany Tile Factory\u2014whose profits are down by 30%. AnyCompany\u2019s management wants to use an issue tree to identify the main issues and subordinate issues, and then use it to analyze reasons for declining profits. To give additional context to the LLM, we provided the following diagram with a skeleton issue tree structure.\n\nTo prompt the LLM, we attached the preceding diagram and used the following text:\n\nProblem = profits at the AnyCompany Tile Factory is down 30%. Using the diagram as a guide, can you develop an issue tree identifying the main issues, sub issues and then help with the corresponding analysis against each sub-issue to find the reasons for profit decline?\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM:\n\nAnd we populated the issue tree with the response from the LLM for additional visual clarity, as shown in the following diagram.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, the LLM has intelligently identified the two main top-level issues contributing to profit decline at AnyCompany (revenue decline and cost increases) and under each category identified the secondary issues, together with a high-level analysis for the management to pursue.\n\nNext, we asked the LLM to elaborate \u201cfacility overhead costs\u201d using the prompt:\n\nPlease elaborate \u201cfacility overhead costs\u201d\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM:\n\nSWOT\n\nA SWOT analysis is a strategic management tool that can be used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an organization, industry, or project. SWOT helps in decision-making and strategy formulation by identifying internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats) that can impact success. Management can then use the analysis to develop way forward strategies, using strengths, addressing weaknesses, capitalizing on opportunities, and mitigating threats, as identified in the SWOT.\n\nIn this example, we ask the LLM to develop a way forward strategy for the Australian higher education sector using the SWOT analysis diagram provided. We ask it to identify four key strategic themes for the sector, making sure the approach uses inherent strengths, addresses weaknesses, capitalizes on opportunities, and mitigates threats, as identified in the SWOT diagram and illustrated in the following graphic. We also ask the LLM to list critical activities to be pursued by the sector under each strategic theme.\n\nTo prompt the LLM, we attached the preceding diagram and used the following text:\n\nUsing the SWOT analysis for the Australian higher education sector, we want your expertise to help develop the way forward strategy. Please identify 4 key strategic themes for the sector, ensuring your approach leverages strengths, addresses weaknesses, capitalizes on opportunities, mitigates threats as identified in the SWOT diagram. Under each strategic theme, list critical activities to be pursued.\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM, which includes four strategic themes and activities to be pursued:\n\nWe constructed the following diagram based on the LLM response for visual clarity.\n\nValue chain analysis\n\nValue chain analysis is a strategic management tool that helps organizations evaluate each value-creating activity in their value chain, such as inbound logistics or operations, to identify opportunities to build completive advantage, reduce costs, and increase efficiencies.\n\nIn this example, we want the LLM to perform a value chain analysis for the AnyCompany Tile Factory and make recommendations to improve profitability. As additional context to the LLM, we provided the following end-to-end value chain diagram for AnyCompany.\n\nTo prompt the LLM, we used the following text:\n\nProfits at the AnyCompany Tile Factory are down 30%. The diagram shows their end-to-end value chain. Please perform a value chain analysis and make recommendations to improve profitability at AnyCompany.\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM, with recommendations for improving profitability across the five main areas:\n\nWe updated the value chain diagram with the recommendations supplied by the LLM under each category, as shown in the following diagram.\n\nValue driver tree\n\nA value driver tree is a framework that maps out key factors influencing an organization\u2019s value or specific metrics such as revenue, profit, or customer satisfaction. This framework breaks down high-level business objectives and drivers into smaller, measurable components. By doing so, it reveals the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements, providing insights into how various factors contribute to overall business performance. Value driver trees are used for business performance improvement, strategic planning, and decision-making.\n\nIn this example, we want the LLM to define a value driver tree for the AnyCompany Tile Factory so the management team can analyze revenue, cost, and efficiency drivers contributing to low profitability and take action to remediate issues.\n\nTo prompt the LLM we used the following:\n\nProfits at the AnyCompany Tile Factory are down 30%. Please help develop a value driver tree for the AnyCompany\u2019s management to analyze the problem and take remedial action. Consider revenue, cost and efficiency drivers\n\nWe get the following response from the LLM, with a breakdown of major components\u2014revenue, costs, and efficiency\u2014 affecting profitability at AnyCompany. It has also provided a five-step action plan for the management to consider.\n\nWe constructed the following value driver diagram for AnyCompany Tile Factory in tree format, based on the responses provided by the LLM.\n\nConclusion\n\nProblem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning are cognitive processes that use the brain to find a solution to a problem or reach an end goal, especially when the answer isn\u2019t immediately obvious. As we\u2019ve shown in the examples in this post, LLMs such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock can be used to improve your cognitive skills, especially in the areas of problem-solving, creative thinking, and ideation. This in turn will help improve team collaboration, cut decision times, and drive innovation. The examples we used are basic to showcase the art of the possible. To improve LLM responses in complex problem-solving use cases, we recommend using RAG sources that are relevant to the problem, chain-of-thought prompting, and giving additional problem-specific context through prompt engineering.\n\nWe encourage you to begin exploring these capabilities through the Amazon Bedrock chat playground, a tool in the AWS Management Console that provides a visual interface to experiment with running inference on different LLMs and using different configurations.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nSenaka Ariyasinghe is a Senior Partner Solutions Architect working with Global Systems Integrators at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Register now to save 20% on your pass .\n\nUnder pressure from bipartisan lawmakers, Google, Amazon, and other major ad industry players have shared the actions they\u2019re taking after they inadvertently helped facilitate advertising on a site known to host child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\nAmazon has issued refunds to advertising customers whose ads appeared on the website. Google has blocked advertising on the site but did not clarify whether it will reimburse advertisers who were affected.\n\n\u201cWe have always strictly prohibited ads that we serve from appearing next to content of this nature\u2013this was a clear breach of our policies,\u201d Amazon\u2019s vice president of public policy Brian Huseman wrote in a letter addressed to Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), obtained by ADWEEK.\n\nEarlier this month, the two senators demanded answers from the tech giants and other advertising groups after an Adalytics report found that, through advertising networks operated by Google and Amazon, ads from Fortune 500 brands appeared on an image-hosting site and a sister site that had been flagged by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) for publishing CSAM.\n\nAmazon and Google under fire\n\nIn his letter to lawmakers, Amazon\u2019s Huseman said the company \u201cimmediately blocked these websites from any further ads through our systems.\u201d The company has refunded all advertisers whose messages appeared on pages on the site in question, ibb.co and the associated img.bb, he said.\n\nOnly \u201ca tiny portion of advertising spend for a small number of advertisers\u201d was impacted, and the company has refunded all advertisers whose content appeared on the website in question, an Amazon spokesperson told ADWEEK.\n\n\u201cWe regret that this occurred and took swift action to block these websites from showing our ads,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe have strict policies in place against serving ads on content of this nature, and we are taking additional steps to help ensure this does not happen in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in a response to senators issued by Google\u2019s head of U.S. federal government affairs and public policy, Anne Wall, the company said it has \u201cinvested significant resources\u2014in technology, specialized teams, and time\u2014to deterring, detecting, removing, and reporting child sexual exploitation content and behavior.\u201d\n\nGoogle said it demonetized ibb.co in January 2024, and the site has generated no ad revenue since then. The associated imgbb.com, the company said, was demand-restricted last July, meaning that most ads were already disallowed on Google\u2019s ad network. Google fully demonetized imgbb.com when it learned about the forthcoming Adalytics report.\n\nThe company also emphasized its strict publisher monetization policies, enforcement measures, and advertiser controls. Google did not announce any policy or product changes, but said it will \u201ccontinue to holistically evaluate our processes to determine whether any additional steps should be taken.\u201d\n\nGoogle declined a request for comment and did not respond to questions about whether it would reimburse affected advertisers.\n\nWhat about the other implicated parties?\n\nThe senators also questioned verification vendors DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS) over apparent brand safety failures, as well as the Media Rating Council (MRC) and the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), which issued stamps of approval for their technology.\n\nAll six organizations\u2014Google, Amazon, DoubleVerify, IAS, the MRC, and TAG\u2014have responded to senators\u2019 inquiries in letters obtained by ADWEEK.\n\nIn its letter, DoubleVerify claimed that its tools function based on advertiser preferences and that technical limitations contributed to ads appearing alongside explicit content on the site in question.\n\nFollowing the scandal, DoubleVerify has rolled out a handful of brand safety updates, expanded its blocklists, and begun working more closely with law enforcement and NCMEC to enhance detection and prevention measures. The firm has also enabled access to full URL-level reporting for clients, which allows brands to understand the exact pages on which their ads appear, not just the domains.\n\nIAS, for its part, said it has blacklisted the flagged domains\u2014which it found represented less than 0.00025% of its monitored impressions\u2014and is reassessing how it classifies image-hosting sites. The verification company also outlined limitations in monitoring image-only pages, but reaffirmed its commitment to industry safety standards.\n\nEarlier this month, IAS also expanded its exclusion list, adding domains flagged in five years of NCMEC reports. It\u2019s also improving its user-generated content filtering tech and boosting URL-level reporting to improve transparency for advertisers.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to working in partnership with the industry and other companies to reduce the proliferation of bad actors while preserving the open internet,\u201d wrote IAS CEO Lisa Utzschneider.\n\nMeanwhile, MRC head George Ivie took the opportunity to explain that both DoubleVerify and IAS hold MRC accreditation for \u201cProperty Level Ad Verification,\u201d which examines text and keywords rather than visual content. This distinction is significant, he said, as the CSAM-hosting site in question typically contains minimal text, making the content undetectable through current accredited methods.\n\nMoving forward, Ivie wrote, \u201cMRC encourages services to submit Content Level Brand Safety products for audit and accreditation.\u201d He also said MRC will consider strengthening disclosure requirements about the limitations of current verification technologies.\n\nIn a 23-page response to senators signed by vice president of policy and compliance Todd Miller, TAG claimed to be \u201cthe leading global initiative fighting criminal activity and increasing trust in the digital advertising industry.\u201d\n\nThe company pushed back against Blackburn\u2019s and Blumenthal\u2019s broad labeling of platforms as \u201cCSAM sites\u201d merely for receiving NCMEC notifications, adding that operating on this standard would have negative implications for user-generated content platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Pinterest, X, and others.\n\nBut TAG president and CEO Mike Zaneis told ADWEEK that, since submitting its letter to lawmakers, the organization has begun working with NCMEC to set up an educational sit that will help the ad industry learn more about the details of NCMEC\u2019s programs. NCMEC will also help train TAG\u2019s Threat Exchange participants, which include major industry players. \u201cWe are excited to be developing these solutions to provide greater protections for children worldwide,\u201d Zaneis said.\n\nIn the fallout since the initial report was published, the MRC and TAG have come under fire from ad industry leaders who view their approaches as insufficiently stringent.\n\nThe six letters from industry players have not been published publicly.\n\nDoubleVerify, IAS, and MRC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUpdate Feb. 28, 6:16 pm ET: A screenshot of Amazon\u2019s letter to Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal has been added to this story. Additionally, a statement from TAG president and CEO Mike Zaneis has been integrated.",

For the first time, Amazon will charge users to access a version of Alexa. The \"Alexa+\" service will be $19.99 a month, or free for Amazon Prime members, and will roll out in early access next month.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nDuring the demonstration this week, Alexa+ was able to make dinner reservations, order groceries or book an Uber, tasks that were mostly not possible with older versions. Alexa, once a leader in natural language and machine learning, has been lagging the competition since the emergence of generative AI chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which have quickly advanced beyond text conversations and into AI-generated audio, images and videos.\n\nAnthropic declined to comment. Amazon said information in the story is \"false.\"\n\n\"In fact, over the past four weeks Nova handled over 70% of conversations \u2014 including complex requests,\" an Amazon spokesperson wrote in an email. \"That said, from a customer perspective this doesn't matter \u2014 both are excellent models and in there to deliver the best experience for customers.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the way Amazon designed the architecture, \"Alexa+ is always using the best model for each task.\"\n\nAt the event, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy described the overhaul as \"rearchitecting\" the brain of Alexa.\n\nIn addition to the roughly $8 billion its agreed to invest in Anthropic, Amazon has been developing its own AI models and rolled out its Nova series late last year. Amazon offers Anthropic's Claude model as part of its Amazon Web Services Bedrock offering, which gives customers access to a variety of AI options. It lets users pick between Amazon's Nova and Titan models, as well as Mistral and others.\n\nAmazon said it used Bedrock to power Alexa. But Claude has been the model tackling the more complex tasks the company showcased at its devices event in New York this week, the sources said. Claude has powered the queries that take more thinking and \"intellectual heft,\" one person said.\n\nWhile Amazon's own AI models are still being used, they are handling the tasks that require less reasoning, these people said.\n\nAs part of Amazon's initial investment into Anthropic, the company was able to use a certain amount of Anthropic capacity for free over the course of 18 months, according to one source. That deal has now expired, and the companies are renegotiating the terms of their agreement, the person said.\n\nAnthropic's model has expanded far beyond Alexa within Amazon and is helping to drive product search and advertising as well, the person said.\n\nPanos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services and the leader of Alexa's redesign, called Anthropic an \"awesome\" partner at this week's event. Panay, who joined the company in 2023 after two decades at Microsoft, said Anthropic's foundational model is \"incredible.\"\n\n\"We pick the model that's right for the job,\" Panay told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday. \"We use Amazon Bedrock \u2014 Alexa picks the right model to get the job done.\"\n\nWATCH: Alexa+ has arrived",

(Ross D. Franklin/AP/File)\n\nSome supporters of the blackout have suggested boycotting specific corporations that have ended their diversity, equity and inclusion programs following President Trump\u2019s executive order targeting DEI initiatives. But while the People's Union calls the abandonment of DEI programs \u201cregressive and unacceptable,\u201d the Feb. 28 boycott is aimed at all major retailers, regardless of their stance on DEI.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,\u201d the organization said on its website.\n\nIn a follow-up video posted on the eve of the planned blackout, Schwarz told his Instagram followers not to be discouraged if they see people shopping on Friday.\n\n\"Remember: There are 340 million people in America, and not all of them will stand with us,\" he said. \"But millions will.\"\n\nWhat happens after Feb. 28?\n\nSchwarz told USA Today earlier this month that he hopes to boycott other businesses \"that are really the biggest offenders within the system.\"\n\nThe People's Union is already planning weeklong blackouts aimed at specific retailers, including Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe first, targeting Amazon, is scheduled to begin March 7.",

The unit also already provides intermodal services.\n\nAmazon\u2019s planned disruption in the LTL market carries potential risks for the industry, Bank of America analysts said in a research note.

That\u2019s an expansion of LTL services from the United Kingdom.\n\nBut J.P. Morgan analysts, based on conversations with carriers and 3PLs, questioned Amazon\u2019s ability to become a stand-alone carrier.\n\n\u201cOur industry conversations indicated that the vast majority did not see Amazon as a threat to national LTL carriers at any point in the future,\u201d a research note said, detailing roadblocks with issues such as terminals and pointing out that the company has skipped over Yellow Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy auctioned properties so far.\n\nThe appeal with Amazon is its ability to innovate by working backward from customer needs, LTL veteran Scooter Sayers noted in a LinkedIn post. That\u2019s allowed it to move more parcels than anyone else, he wrote.\n\nBut the Teamsters could also intervene on behalf of heavy duty truck drivers, given the labor group\u2019s history with seeking to unionize Amazon workers, said analyst Satish Jindel, founder of SJ Consulting Group. He doesn\u2019t see the e-commerce giant moving in that direction.\n\nPeople think that because of Amazon\u2019s success elsewhere that anything the business touches turns to gold, but that\u2019s not always the case, Jindel said.\n\nAmazon has previously had success creating new freight mode divisions, however.\n\nAround a decade ago, the e-commerce giant moved to break into the air cargo industry and has generally seen steady growth over the years. As of February 2024, Amazon Air operated 202 average daily flights, according to a report from DePaul University Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development.\n\n\u201cThe unit stands out for bucking the trend toward large-scale reductions in the air-cargo sector and has increased its cargo capacity by prioritizing larger planes,\u201d the report said.",

But in a surprising departure from its usual playbook, the company didn\u2019t announce new Echo devices to go with its revamped digital helper.\n\nBut that might not be the case for long.\n\nWhile Panos Panay, head of Amazon\u2019s devices and services business, wouldn\u2019t say whether the company was considering a new version of its Alexa-enabled smart glasses with cameras to compete with Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, he did suggest that new products are in the works. \u201cBut I think you can imagine, there\u2019s going to be a whole slew of AI devices that are coming,\u201d he told CNN in an interview.\n\nHis remarks come as tech giants are racing to incorporate AI agents and chatbots into new devices. Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence suite, Apple Intelligence, was the headlining feature of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 lineup, including the cheaper iPhone 16e that was just announced last week. Microsoft has also made its Copilot virtual helper the centerpiece of its ubiquitous Windows PC operating system.\n\nPanay declined to offer more details on the nature of the \u201cslew of AI devices.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon device is displayed at an Amazon Devices launch event in New York City on February 26, 2025. Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nBut he suggested new products would be part of a larger overall vision. \u201cYou can imagine\u2026 a constellation of devices that has to come together to make it a better experience,\u201d Panay added.\n\nAmazon already has a \u201cconstellation\u201d of devices, from its Ring security cameras to its Eero Wi-Fi routers and, of course, its Echo smart speakers. And it\u2019s starting to incorporate Alexa+ into some of those gadgets; Alexa+ will be able to answer questions about what happened in your home while you were gone based on Ring camera footage, for example. The company has also dabbled in smart rings and fitness trackers in addition to its Alexa-powered glasses.\n\nA person views Amazon Echo Frames at the Venetian Expo Center during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 11, 2024. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut smart glasses, or glasses that have embedded virtual assistants and can play music and deliver phone notifications, are becoming more relevant thanks to improved AI models that can process both visual and speech input.\n\nMeta\u2019s Ray Ban glasses, which can translate language and answer questions about what a user is looking at, have seemingly caught on with people so far, at least somewhat. While the numbers pale in comparison to the numbers of consumer electronics, like iPhones, Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica reported this month that two million pairs have been sold since their 2023 debut.\n\nSamsung and Google also announced last year that they\u2019re building a new version of Android specifically for smart glasses in the future, hinting that a wave of new spectacles are likely to come.\n\nBut Amazon\u2019s glasses, called the Echo Frames, lack cameras and arguably came too soon \u2013 long before the arrival of Alexa+ and other AI assistants that can process sight and sound simultaneously.\n\nBut for now, Amazon is keeping its focus on Alexa.\n\n\u201cWe have an amazing lineup coming,\u201d Panay said of future hardware devices. \u201cBut we also have an amazing lineup in market, and Alexa (is) so new.\u201d",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nAWS services generate rich log and metric data, enabling you to create comprehensive dashboards that reveal valuable insights, including detailed visibility into Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) connectivity patterns. This post demonstrates how Amazon QuickSight and Amazon Q in QuickSight enable data visualization from any source. We focus on visualizing connectivity patterns in VPCs to showcase the benefits of QuickSight for users with varying technical expertise.\n\nAmazon QuickSight is a fully managed, cloud-scale business intelligence (BI) service that enables users to create and share interactive dashboards, analyze data, and gain insights through visualizations. On April 30th, 2024, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Q in QuickSight, which enhances QuickSight by providing generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to visualize data using natural language queries.\n\nIn the following sections, we explore two use cases that collect data from different sources, enhance it, and visualize it using QuickSight. These examples demonstrate how Amazon Q can quickly generate visualizations from common natural language queries, showcasing the ease and efficiency of using QuickSight and Q for generating insightful dashboards.\n\nOverview\n\nThis post presents two use cases that demonstrate how to visualize VPC Flow log data using Amazon Q in QuickSight. These examples work regardless of the source solution used to capture and enrich the data. Although we developed these use cases for this post, you can also use this as a reference for any use case that you have.\n\nUse case #1: Enriched VPC Flow Logs with security group and cost tags\n\nFigure 1: Architecture diagram \u2013 Enriched VPC Flow Logs with Amazon Q in QuickSight\n\nVPC Flow Logs generate records using predefined fields. AWS Lambda can enrich these Flow Logs with more fields, creating a customized view of VPC traffic flows.\n\nIn the architecture shown in Figure 1, VPC Flow Logs are generated and sent to Amazon Data Firehose. Logs are then forwarded to Lambda for enrichment. Lambda adds more attributes to the flows, such as the security group and cost tag for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the VPC Flow Log entry, before delivering them to Amazon S3. AWS Glue Catalog stores the table definitions for the enriched VPC Flow logs. This allows Amazon Athena to query the data efficiently. Finally, QuickSight visualizes the data from Athena. The data flow is as follows:\n\nVPC Flow Logs are enabled on an existing VPC by the AWS CloudFormation template. Log records are sent to Data Firehose. Data Firehose is configured to emit metrics and logs to Amazon CloudWatch for troubleshooting if necessary. Data Firehose invokes a Lambda to enrich the VPC Flow Logs with more attributes, such as Amazon EC2 security group and cost tag. Lambda is configured to emit metrics and logs to CloudWatch for troubleshooting if necessary. Enriched VPC Flow Logs are delivered to an S3 bucket. AWS Glue crawls the S3 bucket to catalog the data for querying. Athena queries the cataloged data from AWS Glue. QuickSight uses Athena and Amazon S3 as a data source for the dataset. A blank analysis is created ready to begin visualizing the VPC Flow Logs. Amazon Q is enabled on the analysis through a Q topic. The Q topic allows Quicksight to interpret natural language queries to facilitate the development of visuals in the analysis.\n\nUse Case #2: VPC Flow Logs and Amazon Route 53 Resolver Logs\n\nFigure 2: Architecture diagram \u2013 Enhanced VPC Traffic Analysis with Route 53 Resolver Logs using Amazon Q in QuickSight\n\nVPC Flow Logs and Amazon Route 53 Resolver Logs provide complementary information about network traffic in your VPC.\n\nIn the architecture shown in Figure 2, VPC Flow Logs capture detailed information on traffic in your VPC between different IP addresses, but do not include domain names. This combination offers a comprehensive view of your VPC network traffic. The data flow is as follows:\n\nVPC Flow Logs are enabled on an existing VPC by the CloudFormation template. VPC Flow logs are sent to Amazon S3. Route 53 Resolver Logs are also created and associated to the VPC for which the VPC Flow Logs were created. Route 53 Resolver Logs are sent to Amazon S3 Lambda is used to execute Athena queries for merging VPC Flow Logs and Route 53 Resolver Logs. Both VPC Flow Logs and Route 53 Resolver Logs are combined based on the IP addresses each day. These map network traffic in the VPC Flow Logs to the domain names and keep the analysis up to date on a daily basis. Changes to the domain name to IP mapping are updated accordingly. QuickSight uses Athena and Amazon S3 as a data source for the dataset. A blank analysis is created ready to begin visualizing the VPC Flow Logs. Amazon Q is enabled on the analysis through a Q topic. The Q topic allows Quicksight to interpret natural language queries to facilitate the development of visuals in the analysis.\n\nThis post provides a walkthrough for the first use case. For more detailed information on both use cases, such as walkthroughs and related CloudFormation templates, visit the AWS Samples GitHub repository.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, follow these steps:\n\nDeploy one of the CloudFormationtemplates provided in the aws-samples GitHub repository. Each example in this repository has its own detailed documentation hosted in the aws-samples GitHub repository. Make sure your QuickSight user has a PRO role to access the Amazon Q functionality demonstrated in this post.\n\nThis post provides two examples. We may add more examples to the aws-samples repository in the future. The walkthrough steps in this post apply to all provided examples.\n\nWalkthrough: Gain insights into your data with Q in QuickSight\n\nReview the preconfigured Q topics in the deployed CloudFormation template. Q topics streamline visualization queries by establishing natural language synonyms to data fields. Query Q in QuickSight for insights into your VPC Flow Log data.\n\n1. Review Q topics in QuickSight\n\nIn this section we review the Q topic deployed by the CloudFormation template.\n\nFollow these steps as shown in Figure 3.\n\nOpen the AWS Console and navigate to QuickSight. In the left-hand pane, choose Topics. Choose the topic name.\n\nFigure 3: Q topics\n\nChoose the tabs at the top, navigate to Data, then DATA FIELDS. QuickSight automatically populates the data fields with the fields from the dataset. It also populates synonyms for the corresponding fields where possible. In this example, the synonyms have been defined in the CloudFormation template. Synonyms help Amazon Q in correlating your queries with the fields in the data set. You can further customize the data fields to match your organization\u2019s terminology. This results in more meaningful and accurate responses from Amazon Q. Refresh the Q topic indexes to reflect these changes in future analyses.\n\nFigure 4: Q topics \u2013 edit topic\n\nAnother helpful customization is Field Value Synonyms. This allows you to add synonyms to values in the VPC Flow Logs data. In the following example, synonyms have been added to IP protocols numbers. This allows Q to correctly interpret queries of VPC Flow Logs with the words icmp, tcp, udp.\n\nFigure 5: Q topics \u2013 edit synonyms\n\n2. Query Q for insights into the VPC Flow Log data\n\nWe ask Q in QuickSight a question regarding the VPC Flow Log data. Choose Ask a question about at the top center of the QuickSight screen.\n\nFigure 6: Q topics \u2013 ask a question\n\nAs shown in the following Figure 7, we have asked Amazon Q \u201cwhich cost tags had the most megabytes in October 2024 by hour\u201d. Amazon Q has processed our question and, using the defined synonyms, interpreted the question as \u201cTotal Megabytes by Start Datetime hour and Cost Tag for Start Datetime in October 2024\u201d. Amazon Q provided a response to the question, supported by detailed visual data backing the response.\n\nFigure 7: Q topics \u2013 question result\n\nWalkthrough: populate QuickSight Analysis with Amazon Q\n\nLink the Q topic with the QuickSight Analysis Populate the QuickSight Analysis by adding visuals generated by Amazon Q. This post provides a few example queries.\n\n1. Link QuickSight Analysis to Q topic\n\nAfter reviewing Q topics, we explore Analyses. An Analyses is a collection of visualizations, interactive dashboards, and data insights that are created and organized on one or more sheets to explore and present data effectively.\n\nWe create our first visualizations in the Analyses. The CloudFormation template has created a blank Analysis linked to the dataset that imports VPC Flow Logs data from Athena. Choose the Analysis name to begin, as shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8: Amazon Q Analyses\n\nTo run queries on Amazon Q, link the Q topic to the Analysis. On the center of the top bar, choose the vertical ellipsis (\u22ee) next to Build visual, and choose Topic Linking from the menu. Enable the Link topic for Build Visual and Q&A option, and choose the topic deployed by CloudFormation from the drop down. Choose APPLY CHANGES, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9: Amazon Q Analyses \u2013 topic linking\n\n2. Populate QuickSight Analysis\n\nOn the center of the top bar, choose Build visual. The Build a visual right pane is revealed. Begin by typing the first natural language question and choose BUILD. We have provided four sample questions to get you started for the first use case. The QuickSight documentation provides types of questions supported by Q with more sample questions. QuickSight Enterprise Edition is prerequisite to ask questions using Amazon Q.\n\nSample questions:\n\nshow top source and destination ip by gigabyte\n\nshow top source ip and path internet gateway by gigabyte\n\nshow top security group by megabytes\n\nshow megabytes egress date start May by hour\n\nThe second use case has its own sample questions documented in the GitHub repository.\n\nAmazon Q interprets the questions and derives a query based on the field from the dataset and the defined synonyms in the linked topic. Amazon Q also chooses a visual type, which can be changed. On the top right of the visual, choose the image of a bar graph and choose the visual type that best visually represents the data for you. Choose ADD TO ANALYSIS, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: Amazon Q Analyses \u2013 build visual\n\nThe following dashboard has been populated with the visuals from the four examples questions, as shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11: Amazon Q Analyses \u2013 deployed visuals\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, you have learned how to use Amazon QuickSight to visualize data from various data sources using natural language queries. Amazon Q in QuickSight democratizes data access, empowering everyone in your organization to make data-driven decisions. Organizing your data into intuitive topics and enabling natural language queries allows Amazon Q users to gain insights to VPC flow.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon on Wednesday unveiled a generative-AI infused Alexa that it says will allow the popular voice assistant to have more personality, check a user\u2019s tone and even plan romantic dates.\n\nBut unlike before, when Alexa was offered for free on any Alexa-enabled devices, customers will have to pay Amazon a monthly fee of $19.99 for the revamped voice assistant, which it calls \u201cAlexa+\u201d. However, the generative-AI powered Alexa will be free for Prime members, who pay the company a monthly or annual fee for free delivery and other perks.\n\nAt a media event held in New York City, Amazon executives showed off the update to the ten-year old digital assistant with the new features aimed at boosting sales and interactions with Alexa-enabled devices.\n\nThe company says Alexa+ is able to have conversations with a more natural, humanlike flow and can learn more about a user \u2014 such as dietary preferences or allergies \u2014 the more it\u2019s used.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just an assistant, I\u2019m your new best friend in the digital world,\u201d Alexa+ said during an onstage demo on Wednesday.\n\nAt the event, Panos Panay, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices & services, listed off the other things the voice assistant can now do, such as create study plans, text a babysitter and call an Uber ride for a friend. He and other company executives also said Alexa can fetch videos from Ring cameras \u2014 such as checking whether a user\u2019s dog was walked that day \u2014 and is able to remember handwritten recipes, emails and other documents shared with it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s smarter than she\u2019s ever been before, but she\u2019s also approachable,\u201d Panay said.\n\nAlexa is built into products such as smart speakers, Amazon\u2019s Fire TVs and earbuds. The Seattle-based tech giant launched its popular voice assistant in 2014 alongside its first Echo device, which responds to voice commands. Panay said Amazon has sold more than 600 million Alexa-enabled devices and that user engagement grew 20% last year compared to 2023. Some market estimates have shown Alexa holds the largest market share among voice assistants.\n\nThe revamped Alexa uses large language models, including some developed by Amazon and others by Anthropic, the generative AI startup the tech giant has poured billions into. Alexa+ has a \u201cmodel-agnostic system,\u201d allowing it to select the best AI model for the tasks it wants to complete, said Daniel Rausch, Amazon\u2019s vice president for Alexa and Echo.\n\nAmazon says it will kick off \u201cearly access\u201d of Alexa+, currently only available in English, in the U.S. next month \u2014 starting with users who own or purchase some of its newest Echo Show devices, which feature onscreen displays of Alexa responses. After opting in, those eligible users will then see Alexa+ start working across compatible devices, as well as on their web browser and app, the company said. Amazon will later roll out the update in \u201cwaves\u201d internationally and to more devices. Some of the new features are only built for products with screens.\n\nAlexa+ will not reach certain older Echo models \u2014 but Amazon says owners of those devices can continue to use the original assistant. And users who simply prefer using the original Alexa can continue doing so, per a FAQ from the company.\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement came more than a year after the company teased an early version of an AI-infused Alexa at a media event held to show off new devices. At the time, Amazon had said it was working on a \u201cspeech-to-speech\u201d model that would allow Alexa to exhibit humanlike attributes, such as laughter and phrases like \u201cuh-huh\u201d during conversations.\n\nDuring the demo on Wednesday, Amazon highlighted features it had previously kept under lid. In one exchange, Panay showed the new Alexa a video of the crowd in the room to test a feature that apparently allows it to sense the surrounding mood. Panay asked Alexa+ if the crowed \u201clooked pumped\u201d to which it responded the room full of journalists were \u201cpaying attention to you and excited.\u201d\n\nLike its predecessor, Alexa+ is enabled when users say the voice assistant\u2019s name \u2014 but executives on Wednesday said users now only have to say that wake word once before having a prolonged, back and forth exchange. Still, demonstrators would occasionally say \u201cAlexa\u201d again if it seemed like the voice assistant didn\u2019t catch something.\n\nAmazon competes in the smart speaker market with other tech giants, including Apple and Google.\n\nThough it has had success in selling devices, the company\u2019s other goal \u2014 driving Amazon purchases through Alexa \u2014 has been more challenging to pull off. Amazon has said Alexa customers have used their device to shop. However, many rely on it mostly for menial tasks, such as playing music, asking questions or checking the weather.\n\nA subscription fee for the revamped Alexa will allow the company to offset costs related to AI development and help its devices operations become more profitable.\n\n_____\n\nThis story was corrected to show that is Panos Panay is Amazon\u2019s senior vice president, not vice president, of devices & services.",

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday revealed its first quantum computing chip, following recent progress by its cloud rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in the race to develop quantum computers. Amazon stock gained in early trading.\n\nThe company's Amazon Web Services cloud division announced the Ocelot chip in a blog post. While still a prototype, Amazon said its efforts can accelerate the timeline to offering viable quantum computing.\n\n\"Ocelot represents a breakthrough in the pursuit to build fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of solving problems of commercial and scientific importance that are beyond the reach of today's conventional computers,\" the AWS blog post said.\n\nOn the stock market today, Amazon stock rose more than 1% to 217.97 in premarket trades.\n\nAmazon's Ocelot Quantum Chip\n\nQuantum computers rely on so-called qubits to process and stores information at a much faster rate that traditional computers. The potential of the technology for scientific and technological breakthroughs has been on investors' radar for years. But the debate about when the technology could be commercially viable has heated up after a series of announcements from major tech players.\n\nAmazon's move into quantum follows Microsoft's announcement last week that it has developed a quantum chip that utilizes a \"breakthrough type of material.\" Google in December announced a new quantum chip called Willow.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the leading provider of cloud computing services, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon launched its AWS Center for Quantum Computing in 2019.\n\nA major challenge for quantum computing, as AWS described, is addressing the errors the supercomputers make as they scale up. Small environmental disturbances like heat or vibrations can cause errors. Amazon said its Ocelot chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by 90% compared to current approaches.\n\n\"With the recent advancements in quantum research, it is no longer a matter of if, but when practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers will be available for real-world applications,\" AWS Director of Quantum Hardware Oskar Painter said in the blog post. \"Ocelot is an important step on that journey. In the future, quantum chips built according to the Ocelot architecture could cost as little as one-fifth of current approaches, due to the drastically reduced number of resources required for error correction. Concretely, we believe this will accelerate our timeline to a practical quantum computer by up to five years.\"\n\nAmazon Stock Down 9% This Month\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's stock has struggled so far this year.

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday debuted its first ever quantum computing chip, joining a growing number of Big Tech names entering the quantum chip space. Called Ocelot, the chip, according to Amazon, helps solve a key problem for quantum computing systems, which could speed up the push to practical quantum computers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement comes just a week after Microsoft (MSFT) revealed its own quantum chip called Majorana 1. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its quantum chip, Willow, in December. Gaining a lead in quantum computing would be a massive opportunity for the cloud giants, ensuring they\u2019d have first-mover advantage in a field that could impact a slew of industries and help drive revenue growth for years.\n\nAmazon says its chip helps enable what\u2019s called bosonic error correction, an important step to figuring out how to get quantum computing systems to the point where they regularly solve the kinds of calculations that would take classic computers years to complete.\n\nAn image of Amazon's Ocelot quantum computing chip. (Image: Amazon) \u00b7 Amazon\n\nQuantum computing differs from classical computing because rather than using bits, the 1s and 0s that chips translate into the software you use every day, they rely on qubits. Instead of representing a 1 or a zero, qubits can exist as both a 1 and a 0 at the same time.\n\nThat allows quantum computers to process huge amounts of information far faster than classical computers. In some cases, quantum computers could perform tasks that would take a regular computer hundreds or thousands of years in minutes.\n\nBut qubits are also fragile, leaving them open to errors if they experience interference from the outside world. Amazon\u2019s chip is meant to efficiently address these errors.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Ocelot's architecture, with its hardware-efficient approach to error correction, positions us well to tackle the next phase of quantum computing: learning how to scale,\u201d Amazon\u2019s head of quantum software applications, Fernando Brand\u00e3o, and head of quantum hardware, Oskar Painter, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cScaling frugally using hardware-efficiency will allow us to achieve more quickly and cost-effectively an error-corrected quantum computer that benefits society,\u201d the two added.\n\nA dillution refrigerator that houses Amazon's Ocelot quantum computing chip. (Image: Amazon) \u00b7 Amazon\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement is just the latest in a string of quantum computing-focused news out of Big Tech players in the race to create a usable quantum computer that can process calculations related to topics ranging from healthcare to materials sciences and more.\n\nLast week, Microsoft debuted its Majorana 1 chip, which the company said uses a new type of material called a topoconductor. According to Microsoft, the topoconductor takes advantage of a new state of matter that is not solid, liquid, or gas but a topological state, though some experts are skeptical of the claim.",

            "content": "Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that AWS Chatbot has been renamed to Amazon Q Developer, representing an enhancement to developer productivity through generative AI-powered capabilities.\n\nThis update represents more than a name change \u2013 it\u2019s an enhancement of our chat-based DevOps capabilities. By combining AWS Chatbot\u2019s proven functionality with Amazon Q\u2019s generative AI capabilities, we\u2019re providing developers with more intuitive, efficient tools for cloud resource management.\n\nTransition for Existing Users\n\nThe transition to Amazon Q Developer maintains compatibility with most workflows. Current AWS Chatbot users should experience no disruption to their configurations, permissions, or established processes, except for the following use cases.\n\nNotifications: If you are using Q in chat applications to send notifications, then you don\u2019t need to make any changes. Your notifications will start showing \u201cAmazon Q\u201d as the sender.\n\nManual commands: The visible change is the new \u201c@Amazon Q\u201d command replacing the previous \u201c@aws\u201d mention in chat channels. If you are running commands manually, then you will use \u201c@Amazon Q\u201d instead of \u201c@aws\u201d.\n\nTip: it is faster to type @Q. The chat platform displays auto complete recommendations with the matching app in the channel.\n\nProgrammatic commands: Your Slack Automation Workflows that trigger commands within the AWS Chatbot won\u2019t change with this renaming. If you are sending messages to your Slack channels programmatically using Webhooks or the API with \u201c@aws\u201d, you\u2019ll need to change how you invoke the app programmatically. For more information, see Updating Slack bot user app mentions when sending messages to chat channels programmatically.\n\nAll service APIs, SDK endpoints, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions remain unchanged, ensuring business continuity.\n\nWe\u2019ve maintained the original AWS ChatBot accessibility by offering Amazon Q Developer\u2019s chat features through the Free tier. This ensures that teams of all sizes can benefit from these enhanced capabilities without additional costs. The renamed service is accessible in all commercial regions, maintaining the same geographical reach as the original AWS Chatbot service.\n\nSecurity remains paramount with Amazon Q Developer. The service maintains all existing security controls, including AWS Organizations Service Control Policies and chat application policies. Organizations can precisely control access to resources and features through granular IAM permissions and channel-specific guardrails. To take advantage of generative AI capabilities organizations will need to add to the configuration of their channel permissions.\n\nEnhanced Chat Capabilities for DevOps\n\nAmazon Q Developer integration with Microsoft Teams and Slack transforms these chat applications into powerful DevOps command centers, where team members can monitor, diagnose, and optimize their AWS resources and applications. Amazon Q Developer in chat applications provide real-time visibility into environment states, helping team members quickly identify which resources are operational or experiencing issues.\n\nTeam members can reduce incident response times and monitor performance issues, traffic spikes, infrastructure events, and security threats through DevOps tooling that enables custom notifications with team member tagging for critical application events, interactive action buttons and aliases for telemetry retrieval, and command execution in chat channels.\n\nBuilding on existing features like custom notifications and actions, command aliases, and Amazon Bedrock Agents integration, Amazon Q Developer uses natural language processing to understand context and intent. For example, when investigating resources in a region, you can ask, \u201cWhat EC2 instances are in us-east-1?\u201d. This natural language understanding streamlines interactions and improves efficiency.\n\nAmazon Q Developer can be used for more comprehensive resource management and status monitoring in chat channels. It can be used to send alerts to chat channels on Amazon CloudWatch metrics for monitoring, or can be used to explore resources across regions or within an account. DevOps teams can execute queries, such as count all VPCs in a region, listing all subnets in a VPC or providing all details for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in a region, such as \u201cprovide all details for EC2 instances in us-east-1\u201d, providing better visibility into infrastructure.\n\nGetting Started\n\nSetting up Amazon Q Developer involves a straightforward process through the Amazon Q Developer console or the AWS SDK. To interact with Amazon Q Developer\u2019s generative AI capabilities, start by adding appropriate managed policies (AmazonQDeveloperAccess or AmazonQFullAccess) to your IAM roles. Your teams can then customize their notification preferences, set up automated responses, and configure security guardrails according to their specific requirements.\n\nWe encourage you to explore the getting started guide for best practices, advanced features, and reviewing our updated documentation. For a summary of changes visit Amazon Q Developer in chat applications rename documentation.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to see how you and your teams leverage these enhanced capabilities to streamline their DevOps workflows and improve collaboration.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAaron Sempf is Next Gen Tech Lead for the AWS Partner Organization in Asia-Pacific and Japan.

            "content": "Lizeth Cuara bought her first pallet of Amazon returns in 2015 for $5,000 to flip for a profit.\n\nCuara worked long hours listing items on the platform and learned the business from YouTube.\n\nThe hustle helped her launch her own retail business which brought in $5 million in sales last year.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Lizeth Cuara, CEO of Misty Phases, a luxury postpartum wear line. Business Insider has verified the financials with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in Compton and was living paycheck to paycheck, working in property management in LA. I didn't feel valued in my job and was looking for a way out.\n\nMy friend suggested I try flipping Amazon return pallets as a side hustle. He had seen friends do it and thought it would help me leave my job.\n\nThe pallets were filled with customer returns like shoes, electronics, and lotions. My friend said you could resell these items on platforms like eBay and make a profit. He knew the warehouses that sold pallets but didn't know more about how it worked.\n\nThis was in February 2015, I was 30 years old and had saved $10,000 since I started working at 17. I decided use my savings and buy two pallets. The worst thing that could happen was returning to the same job and living as I had been.\n\nLearning how to flip Amazon returns pallets\n\nWithin days of having that conversation with my friend, I went to a warehouse in LA to buy my first pallet. The seller was hesitant; he'd seen people fail in this business. I persuaded him to sell me two $5,000 pallets.\n\nI began sorting through the pallets with no idea what I was looking for. I kept whatever looked new. My friend had said people sold the items on eBay, so I searched 'how to list something on eBay' on YouTube.\n\nI downloaded the eBay app and photographed each item on my phone. I uploaded them with the name and price, using YouTube as my guide. I sold items on the first day. Then I had to learn how to ship the items and get paid via PayPal. It was a process of trial, error and YouTube.\n\nI initially focused on getting good reviews so buyers would trust my little eBay store. I also had to be careful not to list anything that was restricted by eBay so my account didn't get banned. There were strict and detailed rules about what you can list.\n\nThe products sold quickly at prices slightly lower than what people could find on Amazon. I didn't have to do marketing because people were already searching for them on eBay. Once I learned how to post, ship, and price items, it became about listing as many items as possible daily. The more I listed, the more I sold.\n\nIt was time-consuming, but I started making money from the pallets right away. With PayPal and eBay, your funds are available almost immediately, so I was able to live off that income. In my first month, I brought in $10,000 in sales, and within a few months, I hit $15,000.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFlipping pallets was lucrative but unpredictable\n\nI was earning more than my old job, but the business was unpredictable. A $5,000 pallet could yield $3,000, break even, or bring in $15,000. One month in, I knew I was going to quit my full time job. Selling pallets was more work, but I enjoyed learning the process even if the days were long. I only slept a couple of hours every night and was constantly working.\n\nMy first step in scaling the business was learning I could buy larger pallets of all one item.\n\nWithin weeks of purchasing my first pallets, I went back to buy more. My initial seller told me I could go to a second warehouse that had products from Amazon sellers that were abandoned or defective. Those pallets would have repetitive items where I'd only have to create one post on eBay, but they were pricey.\n\nI bought mixed pallets about twice a month until I could afford the more expensive pallets of repetitive items.\n\nAfter the first few months, I began spotting patterns in the inventory. Certain types of products consistently sold well that weren't big brands. I learned they were called white-label goods. By researching on Amazon, I found that these lesser-known brands were generating impressive sales.\n\nThe pallet business was profitable, but lacked consistency. I couldn't rely on this model long-term.\n\nAbout eight months after I started selling the pallets, I started researching how to develop and manufacture my own products.\n\nLaunching my own products\n\nI used the money I had generated from eBay as seed money to create products. Having savings gave me the freedom to experiment with samples and overcome setbacks.\n\nMy first products were lotions, teas, waist trainers, and sauna belts. Through my experience with the pallets, I knew people wanted these items. I hired a marketing agency and promoted my products using Facebook ads and influencer marketing.\n\nTo my surprise, the products did exceptionally well. They were featured by Univision and CBS in their lifestyle segments.\n\nManufacturers often require large orders when you're making products. The downside is that not every product will succeed. In my experience, it's best to launch with three or four products because only one or two will likely perform well. I always advise against putting all your money into a single product.\n\nThe upside is that when you order in bulk, your cost per item goes down, which helps with margins. Plus, owning an original product means less competition and more control over pricing.\n\nI learned invaluable lessons about pricing, demand, and customer behavior. These lessons helped me launch my luxury postpartum wear line Misty Phases based on my own traumatic birth and recovery.\n\nI knew how to manufacture products, run Facebook ads, and sell on Amazon and my website. I started Misty Phases at the end of 2022, and it generated over $5 million in sales in 2024.\n\nBetting on myself was the best decision\n\nBuying Amazon return pallets was one of the best decisions I ever made. They provided seed money, insight into e-commerce, and a crash course in entrepreneurship. Now, I'm a single mom and I own a home in California.\n\nThere are risks and challenges in flipping pallets, but it's an incredible way to learn the ropes of selling online, test product ideas, and build capital for bigger dreams. The key is dedication and hard work.\n\nEven now, I know that if everything came crashing down tomorrow, I'd go back to buying pallets in a heartbeat.",

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAlexa+, Amazon\u2019s revamped version of Alexa was unveiled Wednesday, bringing the popular voice assistant into the artificial intelligence era.\n\nThe new Alexa is more conversational, can incorporate a user\u2019s personal preferences into answers, and can handle certain tasks on someone\u2019s behalf, like booking concert tickets, Amazon says. The service costs $19.99 per month but will be free for Amazon Prime members, with early access coming next month.\n\nThe new Alexa is Amazon\u2019s effort to compete with the wave of AI-infused virtual assistants that have grown in popularity since 2022, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\nAmazon, like its rivals, is racing to build what tech giants believe will be the next iteration of AI chatbots: AI agents. Unlike simple chatbots, tech companies promise these agents will be able to take action for you, such as shopping or even handling real-world tasks \u2013 like returning a package you ordered online or calling someone to repair your stove.\n\nAlexa+ is a big part of Amazon\u2019s attempt to do just that \u2013 in addition to upgrading Alexa for the current chatbot era.\n\nWhat Alexa+ can do\n\nAmazon is touting Alexa\u2019s new ability to incorporate a user\u2019s personal context, like the apps and services they use, as being a key differentiator compared to chatbots like ChatGPT. Apple and Google, however are taking a similar approach with their own virtual assistants.\n\nIn a preview video, the company showed Alexa+ handling tasks such as telling a user how many books they\u2019ve read this year, reserve their usual Friday night dinner spot, or alert them when concert tickets for their favorite artist are available.\n\nIt does this by using someone\u2019s personal history and data across apps, devices and services, and can remember a user\u2019s preferences, the company says. Alexa\n\nAlexa+ will also be able to answer questions about a user\u2019s surroundings. Using an Echo Show device, which is the tablet-like version of the Echo with a camera, Panos Panay, Amazon\u2019s head of devices, asked Alexa whether the crowd at the event \u201clooked pumped\u201d after pointing the camera at the audience. \u201cFrom what I can see, those 250 folks look pretty fired up,\u201d it replied.\n\nAlexa+ should also be better at understand context and more natural language, according to Panay. For example, instead of asking Alexa to lower the music volume, you could say something like \u201cplay music but don\u2019t wake the baby.\u201d\n\nPanay attributed Alexa\u2019s revamp to relatively new technologies like generative AI and large language models, both of which provide the foundation for popular AI apps like ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cWhile the vision of Alexa has been ambitious and remains incredibly compelling, until right this moment, we have been limited by the technology,\u201d Panay said.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to the approach Apple and Google are taking with their respective virtual assistants. Apple, for example, is updating Siri with the ability to answer questions based on personal data, while Google wants its Gemini assistant to function as an agent that can handle tasks on your behalf. Amazon\u2019s approach isn\u2019t unique, but it\u2019s a much-needed upgrade that could bring its decade-old assistant up to date with rivals.\n\nPanay also said that Alexa+ has been trained to understand a user\u2019s tone and environment to adapt its response accordingly.\n\nBoosting Amazon\u2019s struggling Echo business\n\nAmazon\u2019s original Echo was a surprising success when it debuted in 2014. But in the decade since Alexa arrived in our living rooms, Amazon has struggled to monetize its hardware division, even as its bet on cheap hardware helped make Alexa the dominant voice assistant.\n\nAnd Amazon\u2019s business model for the Echo stalled as well, as the company hoped people would use the device to increase their Amazon purchases. But consumers primarily ended up using the Echo for tasks like setting alarms and listening to music rather than Amazon shopping, and Amazon has reportedly lost billions of dollars on its Echo business, according to The Wall Street Journal. With Alexa+, Amazon is clearly hoping that will change.\n\nAt the same time, generative AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT began to take the spotlight in late 2022, threatening the voice assistants of yesteryear like Alexa and the Google Assistant.\n\nBut one potential advantage is the way Alexa already integrates with the company\u2019s devices and services, like Fire TVs and Ring cameras. Users will be able to ask Alexa about what happened around the house while they weren\u2019t home, or if anyone took the dog out. Plus, if successful, Alexa+ could also incentivize more consumers to sign up for Amazon\u2019s lucrative $15-per-month Prime service.\n\nAmazon, which previewed the long-awaited update in 2023, made the announcement during an event in New York City.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.",

The update, called Alexa+, is set to make the virtual assistant more conversational and helpful in booking concert tickets, coordinating calendars and suggesting food to be delivered. Alexa+ will cost $19.99 a month or be included for customers who pay for Amazon\u2019s Prime membership program, which costs $14.99 a month. It will begin rolling out next month.\n\n\u201cUntil right this moment, right this moment, we have been limited by the technology,\u201d Panos Panay, the head of Amazon\u2019s devices, said at a media event. \u201cAlexa+ is that trusted assistant that can help you conduct your life and your home.\u201d\n\nWith the changes, Amazon is aiming to catch up in generative A.I. for everyday users. While the Seattle company has in recent months made up for lost time in A.I. products and services that it sells to businesses and other organizations, its grip on consumer A.I. products has been narrower. Alexa\u2019s upgrades, which were first teased in 2023, are Amazon\u2019s biggest bet on becoming a force in consumer A.I.\n\nThe moves are also an opportunity to reboot Alexa, which has been perceived as having fallen behind other virtual assistants. In recent years, Alexa\u2019s growth in the United States has generally stagnated, according to the research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, with people turning to the assistant for only a few main tasks, such as setting timers and alarms, playing music and asking questions about the weather and sports scores.",

            "content": "Amazon took the wraps off a revamped Alexa that is infused with generative artificial intelligence (AI) to be more capable, conversational and agentic than the old version.\n\nCalled Alexa+, it can order groceries, call an Uber, find and book a repairman and other activities, the company said. It can send text messages, go to websites and complete tasks for users through Alexa.com and a new phone app, according to live updates of the in-person event in New York.\n\nAlexa+ has been plagued by delays, reportedly due to it hallucinating or giving wrong information on test questions. The unveiling comes about a year and a half after Amazon first announced it was going to infuse AI into Alexa following the release of ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cUp until a couple years ago, it was pretty difficult to invent with AI, and that changed with the arrival of foundational models and generative AI. This made the technology much more accessible, so people can see the power and magic of what generative AI can do,\u201d said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nBehind the scenes, Alexa+ is powered by Amazon\u2019s Nova large language models as well as those from Anthropic, in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. It also accesses other LLMs through its AI platform, Amazon Bedrock.\n\n\u201cProviding devices that consumers use in their personal and professional lives is key for ultimate stickiness and adoption. Given that Amazon is already in people\u2019s homes already, what will truly move the needle for the company is ultimately the distribution channel of the new agentic AI service,\u201d Inna Tokarev Sela, CEO and founder of illumex, told PYMNTS.\n\nAccording to PYMNTS data, only 1.9% of nearly 2,700 U.S. consumers surveyed use a phone or a voice-activated device to shop and pay for retail products. About a quarter shop online and the rest are in-store.\n\nReasons for the low penetration of voice commerce are limited functionality, compatibility with other platforms, not being user-friendly, or consumers were just not aware these options are available, according to the report.\n\nAlexa+ is free for Amazon Prime members but $19.99 a month for others. It will start rolling out in the next few weeks in the U.S. and works with nearly all existing Alexa devices. Amazon did not debut new or upgraded hardware.\n\nSmarter AI Assistant\n\nPanos Panay, Amazon\u2019s devices and services chief, showed off a redesigned user interface on Echo Show, an Alexa device with a screen, to demonstrate the new capabilities of Alexa+.\n\nHe said Alexa+ can find specific moments in movies at the user\u2019s request \u2014 for example, finding the scene for the song \u201cShallow\u201d in the 2018 movie \u201cA Star is Born\u201d featuring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.\n\nAnother feature is Alexa\u2019s AI-powered search that works with Ring to look through its video library to check, say, whether anyone has walked the dog.\n\nAlexa+ can also remember what it was told previously \u2014 and users only have to say \u201cAlexa\u201d once instead of each time they have a new request during the same conversation. Alexa+ debuted with a new voice as well.\n\nAlexa can also read through documents \u2014 such as HOA rules \u2014 school schedules, handwritten notes and the like. For example, email Alexa the HOA rules and ask questions about it, like whether solar panels are allowed.\n\nAnother use case is to email Alexa the family\u2019s schedule and ask questions, such as, \u201cWhen is it your turn to bring snacks to soccer practice?\u201d Alexa will answer, put it in your calendar and set a reminder for you.\n\nAlexa+ is also integrated with Suno, which creates music and lyrics through generative AI.\n\nFor kids specifically, Amazon unveiled \u201cExplore with Alexa\u201d and \u201cStories with Alexa.\u201d Mara Segal, director of Alexa, said Alexa can create custom stories for kids. Explore lets kids ask Alexa questions and play games.\n\nAlexa+ can also provide information about sports and finance, as well as other data, thanks to its roster of \u201chundreds of partners,\u201d said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo.\n\nThese include AP, Business Insider, Reuters, Time, USA Today, Politico, Forbes, The Washington Post and PC Gamer.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

The next-gen upgrade is more conversational, can execute complex tasks, and is much more personalized. While the rollout starts next month on select Echo Show devices, Amazon claims it'll eventually be available on every Alexa-powered device the company has shipped. It'll cost $20 per month but will be free for Amazon Prime customers.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Amazon's new and improved virtual assistant.\n\nAlexa's Generative AI Era\n\nAmazon says Alexa+ is \u201csmarter than she's ever been before,\" capable of picking up on your tone and delivering answers in a more empathetic voice. It even has more powerful visual capabilities.\n\nDuring a live demo, Panos Panay, who heads up Amazon's Devices and Services department, used an Echo Show to snap a photo of the live audience and asked whether folks looked energetic. The crowd applauded at the start of the interaction, and Alexa+ analyzed the picture and said everyone looked \u201cpretty fired up,\" pointing out finer details like how people had laptops open, and that all eyes were on Panay.\n\nJulian Chokkattu\n\nThe other big new feature is Alexa+'s ability to learn new information you provide. You can feed the assistant documents, emails, study guides, and recipes, and it will memorize it all, allowing you to ask for relevant information later. For example, if you upload a document of the rules from your homeowner's association, you can ask Alexa+ a question like, \u201cCan I add solar panels to my house?\" It will reference the rules. You can refer to any recipes you've used before\u2014or handwritten recipes you've fed to the assistant\u2014and ask specific questions about ingredients or measurements.\n\nThe broad theme is that you can generally ask Alexa+ a question in a natural way and it should be able to help in some way. Where before you may have asked Alexa to \u201cshow me my doorbell feed,\u201d now you can ask Alexa+, \u201cWhen was the last time someone took the dog out for a walk?\u201d You'll need a Ring subscription, but Alexa+ can understand the context of what it sees through your security cameras. These features match many of the capabilities Google has been promising as it injects its Gemini large language models into Google Assistant.\n\nAlexa+ is also supposed to be a lot easier to interact with daily. You can create routines using your voice rather than manually setting things up through the app. It\u2019s easier to shift music throughout your house too. You can move it from speaker to speaker by simply saying, \u201cPlay the music downstairs,\u201d or \u201cPlay the music everywhere, but don\u2019t wake the baby,\u201d and Alexa+ will know to play it in every room except the nursery.",

            "content": "Every year, thousands of students in higher education struggle to navigate enrollment processes, access support services, and find the resources they need to succeed. Sixty percent of students are unaware of the support services available to them, according to a recent study by Tyton Partners in collaboration with Anthology. This data represents a staggering awareness gap that can impede student retention and success.\n\nAnthology is on a mission to change that. As a leading education technology (EdTech) company, Anthology helps over 2,000 institutions empower millions of students with innovative software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions that support their higher education journey.\n\nWithin Anthology\u2019s Services organization, its Student Success services help students navigate college application, financial aid, and course registration processes, technical support, and more \u2013 offering student support from prospective enrollment through graduation.\n\nTo future-proof its Student Success business, Anthology initiated a bold modernization effort. Working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Anthology is developing a comprehensive omnichannel contact center strategy powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the future of student support.\n\nAddressing student needs with comprehensive contact center support\n\nAnthology\u2019s Student Success services provide a comprehensive contact center solution to institutions: they support prospective student inquiries, manage enrollment funnels, resolve financial aid account issues, and more. Anthology\u2019s white-glove contact center service makes sure institutions can deliver consistent, high-quality support to students, faculty, and staff alike.\n\nHowever, as Anthology\u2019s Student Success business scaled, its legacy on-premises system needed to evolve to proactively meet institution and student needs. Today, Anthology Student Success handles over eight million inbound and outbound interactions annually. The scale of these interactions significantly impacted contact center staff, who often handled repetitive inquiries about logging into applications or checking financial aid status. Anthology wanted to streamline the user and employee experience to resolve highly repeatable questions quickly, while freeing contact center staff to handle more complex inquiries.\n\nCollaborating with AWS to transform the student experience and institutional outcomes\n\nAnthology turned to AWS for help. \u201cWe could have moved to the most current version of our existing tech stack,\u201d explains Anthology Senior Vice President Richa Batra. \u201cBut we made the strategic move because of what AWS could offer us in the long term. The AWS name, and their ability to innovate and transform software solutions with AI, forced us to really rethink our business model.\u201d\n\nIn May 2024, Anthology began working closely with its AWS account team and Amazon Connect specialists. Through a series of collaborative strategy sessions and workshops, AWS and Anthology designed a solution that aligned with Anthology\u2019s three main goals: revolutionize enrollment, boost student retention, and drive student success.\n\n\u201cWe worked with people that were intimately familiar with our tech architecture and current environment,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThese strategy sessions were really important to helping us build a strong business case to successfully drive the project forward.\u201d\n\nBy combining AWS technology and generative AI with Anthology\u2019s deep expertise in higher education, these collaborative sessions led to an innovative solution to proactively and reactively support students.\n\nProviding students and staff with new support services in Amazon Connect\n\nAt the heart of Anthology\u2019s contact center transformation is Amazon Connect, an omnichannel cloud contact center designed to deliver seamless communication experiences across voice, text, and chat.\n\nThe solution will power Anthology\u2019s enrollment, retention, help desk, and support services for students with financial and administrative questions. Anthology services and expertise, combined with the cutting-edge technology, efficiency, and scalability of AWS will empower institutions to deliver an unparalleled student experience.\n\nAmazon Connect will help Anthology expedite answers to user inquiries with its AI-driven technology. Students will be able to engage with an AI-powered chatbot, text messaging system, or interactive voice response (IVR) to get answers to routine questions fast, or escalate complex issues to the appropriate agent staff member.\n\n\u201cOur technology today does not manage these repeatable questions, but everything we understand AWS can do will allow us to remove those barriers,\u201d says Batra. \u201cA student doesn\u2019t want to wait on hold to talk to a person\u2014they\u2019re likely in their car or walking across campus. Wouldn\u2019t it be a greater experience if they could resolve this within minutes?\u201d Taking the burden of these repeatable questions off of staff also lets agents pursue more high-impact work.\n\nAmazon Q in Connect, a generative AI-powered assistant for agents, will help contact center staff provide real-time guidance and recommended actions based on a particular query. While handling a call or message from a user, agents can ask the generative AI assistant about the question; the assistant uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the question, search its knowledge databases, and surface the correct answer back to the agent in seconds\u2014helping agents deliver answers faster.\n\nThe Anthology team is particularly excited about the Amazon Connect Contact Lens integration, which will provide real-time analytics and quality management powered by AI. \u201cFrom Contact Lens, we\u2019ll be able to get aggregate data,\u201d explains Batra. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see sentiment by supervisor and by employee, over time. We can then take all our eight million inbound and outbound interactions and apply sentiment analysis to proactively identify students who are at risk.\u201d\n\nProviding proactive student support with generative AI\n\nTo make sure the new modernization strategy aligns with its clients\u2019 needs and expectations, Anthology has established a client council. This council serves as a sounding board throughout the modernization and migration, providing valuable feedback and insights. As the modernization progresses, Batra is already receiving positive feedback from Anthology\u2019s clients. \u201cThey\u2019re excited that our agents will be leveraging AWS AI,\u201d shares Batra. \u201cThe fact that our agents and our employees can use AI to answer questions correctly quickly has been one of the top reasons.\u201d\n\nFor students, this transformation means getting answers faster than ever before. But beyond immediate responses to questions, the new solution also enables proactive support\u2014suggesting services students may not even know exist on campus. Using AI for propensity modeling across multiple data streams will help Anthology discover where a student might need extra support and proactively offer solutions to boost student retention and engagement.\n\nRethinking the future of education support services\n\nWhile Anthology\u2019s contact center modernization strategy is still underway, the company sees this transformation as just the beginning. \u201cIf the generative AI allows us to handle what we do today in a more scalable, efficient, and consistent way,\u201d says Batra, \u201cit opens up the opportunity to rethink how we support students.\u201d\n\nThe conversation and sentiment data from these contact center interactions will uncover insights about student needs previously thought inaccessible. These insights and trends can help Anthology refine its strategies for engagement and retention, enhancing how it supports student success. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be so many other questions that previously went unanswered that we can now help with,\u201d adds Batra.\n\nEvolving technologies like generative AI hold immense promise for transforming higher education. As the generative AI landscape continues to evolve, the AWS EdTech team can help EdTech organizations design, deploy, and go-to-market with innovative solutions that improve education outcomes around the world.

            "content": "Amazon is hosting an Alexa-focused press event in NYC on Wednesday. Considering the company hasn\u2019t held a major device presser in nearly two years \u2014 the last one was in September 2023 \u2014 we\u2019re expecting some splashy announcements.\n\nThe event will not be livestreamed. However, TechCrunch will be reporting on the ground. The festivities, emceed by Amazon\u2019s new devices and services chief Panos Panay, formerly of Microsoft Surface fame, are scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe stakes are high for Amazon, which has reportedly lost billions of dollars on its Alexa business despite selling hundreds of millions of devices. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is said to have pushed the company\u2019s hardware team to find ways to boost profits through monetized subscriptions, fees, and other add-on services.\n\nWe may hear about one of those subscriptions on Wednesday.\n\nAmazon reportedly plans to introduce an upgraded Alexa experience, code-named Remarkable Alexa, designed to make interactions with the assistant feel more natural and intuitive, along the lines of ChatGPT. Priced between $5 and $10 a month, the enhanced Alexa is said to be able to respond to multiple requests in a single command and even take actions autonomously.\n\nAmazon teased some of this functionality back in 2023 during its last tentpole devices event. The company promised the upcoming Alexa experience would be compatible with existing devices and draw on generative AI technologies to take into account the context of requests and personalize its responses.\n\nImproved smart home capabilities could be in tow with the new Alexa, as well. The Verge reports that multiple companies are working on integrations with the new Alexa using developer tools that Amazon announced in 2023. Back then, Amazon said it was collaborating with brands, including iRobot and Philips, on features to simplify scene controls and allow Alexa to better understand what users might want their devices to do.\n\nA big question is whether the new, generative AI-infused Alexa will be able to overcome some of the underlying tech\u2019s more glaring flaws. According to reporting late last year, the new Alexa at one point struggled with basic commands like switching smart lights off and on.\n\nThanks to its tendency to get things wrong on occasion and hallucinate, today\u2019s generative AI is typically less reliable than the more rigid systems that make up Alexa\u2019s current technical scaffolding. The upgraded Alexa\u2019s many delays have given Amazon ample time to address the worst potential blunders, but there\u2019s always an element of unpredictability.\n\nFortunately, the new Alexa won\u2019t be a mandatory upgrade. Reports suggest that Amazon will allow device owners to stick with the \u201cClassic Alexa\u201d experience if they choose.\n\nAs for when they\u2019ll be presented with that choice, it may be a little while. According to The Washington Post, the launch of the upgraded Alexa was delayed earlier this month after the assistant gave incorrect answers to several test questions. Sources told the publication that it may not roll out until the end of March or later.",

It is an adaptation of the novel by Iain M Banks, the first in the late Scottish author\u2019s classic 10-book Culture book series about an interstellar post-scarcity society.\n\nInterior Chinatown creator Charles Yu is writing and executive producing. The potential series also is executive produced by Nomadland Oscar winner Chlo\u00e9 Zhao through her production company Books of Shadows, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment as well as Adele Banks.\n\nIn Consider Phlebas, while war rages between the utopian Culture and the Idiran Empire, a Culture Ship AI \u201cMind\u201d takes refuge on a forbidden planet. Both Horza, a shape-shifting mercenary working for the Idirans, and Balveda, a \u201cSpecial Circumstances\u201d Culture agent, have been tasked with retrieving it to tip the balance in a galaxy-spanning conflict. Consider Phlebas pits sentience against AI in an epic and bloody quest across the cosmos.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAmazon first teamed with Plan B to adapt Consider Phlebas six years ago as Prime Video was just getting into genre/sci-fi series in a major way with the mega rights deal for The Lord of the Rings TV series. A couple of months after setting Consider Phlebas for development with Utopia creator Dennis Kelly as writer, the streamer rescued canceled Syfy drama The Expanse, which was followed by the green light for shows like The Wheel of Time, The Boys, The Peripheral and Fallout. That initial Consider Phlebas TV incarnation ultimately didn\u2019t go forward.\n\nYu most recently served as creator, showrunner and executive producer of the Hulu limited series Interior Chinatown, which was based on his National Book Award-winning novel. He also has written for other shows, including Westworld, Lodge 49 and Legion. Yu is the author of four books, including How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe. He is repped by UTA and Ken Richman & Robby Koch at Hansen Jacobson.\n\nZhao is directing and executive producing the Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot pilot for Hulu, 20th Television and Searchlight TV where she has had a first-look deal. She most recently co-wrote and directed the upcoming movie Hamnet, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. Zhao is repped by CAA, Lichter Grossman and Ilene Feldman Mgmt.\n\nPublished in 1987, Consider Phlebas was Banks\u2019 first sci-fi novel. His literary work was repped by Curtis Brown and Nelson Davis LLP.",

            "content": "ZDNET\n\nAnother day. Another cloud service changing the rules on stuff we already bought and paid for.\n\nThis time, Amazon is removing a feature that's been part of the Kindle experience for more than a decade: downloading files to your computer.\n\nAlso: This clever Kindle trick lets you download 25 books at once - but it's risky\n\nI'm not going to bury the lede: You have until Feb. 26, 2025, to download copies of your Kindle books to your computer. After that, Amazon will remove the ability to download books to files you can control yourself.\n\nI'm a little disappointed that Amazon doesn't say anything about this in its main Digital Content management interface.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThe only time you see this warning is if you select \"Download\" from the three-dot menu next to a book.\n\nScreenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nSo, if you mostly read Kindle ebooks on a Kindle reader or in the Kindle app, you wouldn't necessarily know about the short-fuse download deadline until it's too late.\n\nWhy should you care?\n\nFirst of all, just as a matter of general principle, it's nice to have control over the stuff you bought and presumably own. Digital content isn't really property we own. Vendors make it abundantly clear that we're licensing that content, and even if we paid full-price money for something, it's just licensed, and they reserve the right to take it away if the whim strikes.\n\nAlso: The best Kindles of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nThere have been some examples of where Amazon has reached into our Kindle devices and removed books. In fact, back in 2009, Big Brother Bezos deleted 1984 and Animal Farm from Kindles everywhere. Just last year, Puffin Books edited many of Roald Dahl's books, including Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, to be more socially conscious by removing words like \"fat\" and \"ugly.\" Those edits were pushed into digital copies of the books already in customers' possession.\n\nBooks have always been unchanging snapshots directly into an author's mind. They are instruments of record. But when companies can change their content on the fly, well, that can change everything.\n\nWhen people were able to keep their own copies of books, they had that instrument of record. But when books are changed on the fly, and we can't see the previous versions anymore, it's possible to rewrite history.\n\nWhat if a president decides to sign an executive order to change the name of a body of water? Or what if a president decides that all books referencing his predecessor should be rewritten to describe that predecessor in wildly unflattering terms? Or what if an executive order is given requiring all existing digital books to edit out any mention of, say, slavery or the internment camps of World War II?\n\nAlso: I tested the Kindle most people should buy. Here's why it's the best e-reader out of the lineup\n\nThis could happen. Today, we still have print materials as instruments of record, even if digital copies are modified. But there may be a time in the future when all of our history is represented solely in digital form. Then, it's entirely possible for regimes to rewrite history to represent a particular perspective, whether that's the way it happened or not.\n\nPractical consideration\n\nBut let's get back to practical considerations. First, if you have an old Kindle of a certain vintage, the only way to get Kindle books onto those devices is to download the books and then load them via USB into those old Kindles. I describe the process in detail here.\n\nAlso: Have an old Kindle? How to add new books -- and one thing you should never do\n\nThe same is true for those folks who (somewhat unethically, and possibly illegally) used tools to crack the Kindle DRM so they could read the books on other devices.\n\nIf you think you're ever going to want to put one of your Kindle books onto one of those devices, go ahead and start downloading right now. Because if you wait a week, you won't be able to do so.\n\nIf you're going to want your books, download them now.\n\nLike right now. My wife and I own more than a thousand books. I found this clever hack to help us download them fast. But if you only have a few, it won't take you near as long.\n\nWhat now?\n\nI'm going to still buy Kindle books when I want them. But my wife has really gotten into EPUB-based books. Although she owns one of just about every generation of Kindle ever made, this past holiday season, she bought a Kobo Libre Colour that she's been very happy with.\n\nShe, too, regularly buys Kindle books (she likes the ones that sync with Audible), but she's also regularly started to collect EPUB-format books. Now, with this Amazon change, there's even more motivation to look at alternative e-readers and formats.\n\nAlso: My favorite Kindle accessory seriously upgraded my reading experience (and it only costs $20)\n\nWhat do you think about Amazon's decision to remove the ability to download Kindle books as files? Do you regularly download your eBooks for safekeeping, or do you primarily read them through Amazon's ecosystem?\n\nDoes this change make you reconsider your reliance on Kindle, or are you already exploring alternative platforms like Kobo or Google Play Books? How concerned are you about the implications of digital book ownership and the potential for content to be altered after purchase? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Amazon serves as a global platform for third-party sellers (3P) , which are independent sellers using Amazon as an e-commerce site to offer their products. 3P sales account for roughly 60 percent of total paid units on Amazon\u2019s marketplace. Amazon also provides sellers with end-to-end logistics services . The fulfilled-by-Amazon (FBA) option includes order picking, packing, shipping, and handling and it is now used to distribute about half of the units sold in most Amazon\u2019s markets.Over 100 mergers and acquisitions have paved the way for Amazon\u2019s commerce empire. Since the enormous take-over of grocer Whole Foods worth 13.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2017, Amazon has invested in several industries, from entertainment to tech, from logistics to healthcare. The latest acquisitions show Amazon\u2019s strategic interest in artificial intelligence. In August 2024, the e-commerce giant acquired Perceive, a startup providing AI microprocessors with low power consumption. Amazon\u2019s patent filing activity is intense and signals that the company will stay at the forefront of technology innovations. Drone delivery services \u2013 branded with \u2018Prime air\u2019 \u2013 are being tested in the United States, Italy, and the UK. In addition to that, Generative AI is already being used for personalization and content management purposes. Predictive models based on environmental factors and road safety are being tested to ease the hectic work of drivers participating in Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partner program.Amazon raised the bar of delivery standards in e-commerce by heavily investing in the logistics business Amazon Freight \u2013 one of the biggest and most efficient logistics providers worldwide. The company does not just manage a volume of nearly six billion packages in the United States, but it implemented AI-powered automation able to evaluate shipping costs by considering multiple factors: distance from Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers, inventory balance, seasonality, and so on.

            "content": "Amazon Bedrock is expanding its foundation model (FM) offerings as the generative AI field evolves. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce the availability of Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet foundation model in Amazon Bedrock. As Anthropic\u2019s most intelligent model to date, Claude 3.7 Sonnet stands out as their first hybrid reasoning model capable of producing quick responses or extended thinking, meaning it can work through difficult problems using careful, step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, today we are adding Claude 3.7 Sonnet to the list of models used by Amazon Q Developer. Amazon Q is built on Bedrock, and with Amazon Q you can use the most appropriate model for a specific task such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, for more advanced coding workflows that enable developers to accelerate building across the entire software development lifecycle.\n\nKey highlights of Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nHere are several notable features and capabilities of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock.\n\nThe first Claude model with hybrid reasoning \u2013 Claude 3.7 Sonnet takes a different approach to how models think. Instead of using separate models\u2014one for quick answers and another for solving complex problems\u2014Claude 3.7 Sonnet integrates reasoning as a core capability within a single model. This combination is more similar to how the human brain works. After all, we use the same brain whether we\u2019re answering a simple question or solving a difficult puzzle.\n\nThe model has two modes\u2014standard and extended thinking mode\u2014which can be toggled in Amazon Bedrock. In standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is an improved version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In extended thinking mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet takes additional time to analyze problems in detail, plan solutions, and consider multiple perspectives before providing a response, allowing it to make further gains in performance. You can control speed and cost by choosing when to use reasoning capabilities. Extended thinking tokens count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s most powerful model for coding \u2013 Claude 3.7 Sonnet is state-of-the art for coding, excelling in understanding context and creative problem solving, and according to Anthropic, achieves an industry-leading 70.3% for standard mode on SWE-bench Verified. Claude 3.7 Sonnet also performs better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet across the majority of benchmarks. These enhanced capabilities make Claude 3.7 Sonnet ideal for powering AI agents and complex workflows.\n\nSource: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet\n\nOver 15x longer output capacity than its predecessor \u2013 Compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, this model offers significantly expanded output length. This enhanced capacity is particularly useful when you explicitly request more detail, ask for multiple examples, or request additional context or background information. To achieve long outputs, try asking for a detailed outline (for writing use cases, you can specify outline detail down to the paragraph level and include word count targets). Then, ask for the response to index its paragraphs to the outline and reiterate the word counts. Claude 3.7 Sonnet supports outputs up to 128K tokens long (up to 64K as generally available and up to 128K as a beta).\n\nAdjustable reasoning budget \u2013 You can control the budget for thinking when you use Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock. This flexibility helps you weigh the trade-offs between speed, cost, and performance. By allocating more tokens to reasoning for complex problems or limiting tokens for faster responses, you can optimize performance for your specific use case.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet in action\n\nAs for any new model, I have to request access in the Amazon Bedrock console. In the navigation pane, I choose Model access under Bedrock configurations. Then, I choose Modify model access to request access for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n\nTo try Claude 3.7 Sonnet, I choose Chat / Text under Playgrounds in the navigation pane. Then I choose Select model and choose Anthropic under the Categories and Claude 3.7 Sonnet under the Models. To enable the extended thinking mode, I toggle Model reasoning under Configurations. I type the following prompt, and choose Run:\n\nYou're the manager of a small restaurant facing these challenges: Three staff members called in sick for tonight's dinner service You're expecting a full house (80 seats) There's a large party of 20 coming at 7 PM Your main chef is available but two kitchen helpers are among those who called in sick You have 2 regular servers and 1 trainee available How would you: Reorganize the available staff to handle the situation Prioritize tasks and service Determine if you need to make any adjustments to reservations Handle the large party while maintaining service quality Minimize negative impact on customer experience Explain your reasoning for each decision and discuss potential trade-offs\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the result with an animated image showing the reasoning process of the model.\n\nTo test image-to-text vision capabilities, I upload an image of a detailed architectural site plan created using Amazon Bedrock. I receive a detailed analysis and reasoned insights of this site plan.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet can also be accessed through AWS SDK by using Amazon Bedrock API. To learn more about Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s features and capabilities, visit the Anthropic\u2019s Claude in Amazon Bedrock product detail page.\n\nGet started with Claude 3.7 Sonnet today\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s enhanced capabilities can benefit multiple industry use cases. Businesses can create advanced AI assistants and agents that interact directly with customers. In fields such as healthcare, it can assist in medical imaging analysis and research summarization, and financial services can benefit from its abilities to solve complex financial modeling problems. For developers, it serves as a coding companion that can review code, explain technical concepts, and suggest improvements across different languages.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet is available today in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) Regions. Check the full Region list for future updates.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is priced competitively and matches the price of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Previously, he could have served up to 40 years in prison.\n\nYoung will still face negligent and reckless driving offenses, as well as several hit-and-run and duty to report violations. Those are:\n\nReckless Driving\n\nNegligent Driving\n\nFailure to Remain at Scene after Bodily Injury Accident\n\nFailure to Return to Scene after Bodily Injury Accident\n\nFailure to Stop and Render Aid after Bodily Injury Accident\n\nFailure to Immediately Report the Accident to Police\n\nThese developments occurred at a bail review hearing on Monday.\n\nThe reason for the reduction, according to Baltimore City State's Attorney Ivan Bates, a court commissioner \u201covercharged the defendant.\" Bates sent the following statement to FOX45 regarding the decision:\n\nProsecutors have a duty to bring charges that are supported by evidence. In this case, the District Court Commissioner overcharged the defendant, which would not have resulted in true justice in the courtroom. This incident highlights the importance of Delegate Addison\u2019s bill in Annapolis, which I support; this legislation would ensure that Assistant State's Attorneys with expertise and training review any applications for charges and prevent court commissioners from issuing warrants without actual evidence. To hold this defendant accountable for his actions, our office has dropped the charges not supported by the evidence, and we will reissue them with the correct counts and charges.\n\nCriminal defense attorney Warren Alperstein, who has no relation to this case, says in order to argue assault, the state would have to prove the driver purposefully ran over the victim.\n\n\"The idea of a first-degree assault, that's harder to prove, because you have to show an intent,\" he said, \"Keep in mind that this does not prevent or preclude the State's Attorney's Office from filing some of these charges again in the future.\"\n\n\u201cWhile the event was sensational\u201d, said the judge overseeing Young\u2019s bail review, \"There doesn\u2019t appear to be any maliciousness in the strike.\u201d\n\nWeighing the reduced charges, the fact that Young turned himself into authorities, and his lack of criminal history -- the judge released Young without bail. No driving and no contact with the victim were the only conditions of his release.\n\nat the intersection of E. Pratt and S. Chester Street in Baltimore. Footage from a motion sensor ring doorbell camera picks up as the stop light along Pratt Street turns green and the Amazon truck begins slowly running over a pedestrian in the crosswalk.\n\nThe driver, later identified as Young, can be seen briefly hesitating before running over the 29-year-old woman with his back wheels as well.\n\nWhile the woman cries out in agony, Young is seen on video getting out of the vehicle to assess the situation. Then, he is seen getting back into his van and driving away.\n\nAccording to court documents, officers were able to identify the victim and spoke with her via phone.\n\nShe told officers that she was crossing the street at E. Pratt and S. Chester Street, and when the light turned green at the intersection, she was struck by the Amazon work vehicle and dragged into the middle of the roadway.\n\nThe victim told police that she felt the tire of the vehicle run over her head, and then over her body for a second time.\n\nCourt documents state that Young approached the victim and asked her, \"How did you manage to get hit?\"\n\nYoung then proceeded to get back inside the vehicle and drove away.\n\nOfficials say that the victim is suffering from nine broken ribs, five fractured vertebrae, and had to receive 5 stitches in her left thigh. Additionally, she suffered abrasions over much of her body.\n\nPolice say they were able to obtain the tag number of the vehicle, and Amazon identified the driver as Young.\n\nYou can watch the full Ring camera video of the incident below.\n\nWarning: it may be found disturbing.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Amazon\u2019s influence is pulling streaming ad costs downward.\n\nRight now, ad buyers are paying around $40 to reach a thousand viewers on Prime Video, about the same as on Netflix. Whether that holds for the rest of the year is anyone\u2019s guess, but Amazon\u2019s impact on ad pricing is already undeniable.\n\n\u201cRegarding video CPMs, the average for 2024 was close to $40 on Amazon Prime,\u201d said Robert Kurtz, group vp of search media solutions at Basis Technologies. \u201cThis is comparable to Netflix, but Disney+ was a significant percentage higher than Amazon Prime.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true for advertisers at digital ad agency Markacy. They\u2019re seeing CPMs between $35 and $40 on Amazon Prime, while Netflix rates range from $32 to $42. Disney+ sits between $30 and $38.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buyers market, and we expect it to remain this way until ad load decreases or publishers find more ways to add value so they can increase pricing or at the very least sustain where they are,\u201d said Alex Block, evp of programmatic at Jellyfish. \u201cWhether it be creating packages of more desirable content, adding more audiences into inventory packages, or coming up with new offerings.\u201d\n\nFor competitors, keeping up with all of this from Amazon means lowering their prices too.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the same trends as depicted in this chart. I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201csinking\u201d but I would agree the CPMs are coming down and making the marketplace more efficient for brands,\u201d said Jennifer Kohl, chief media officer at VML. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Amazon is leveraging its humungous scale and ginormous e-commerce infrastructure to disrupt the streaming video landscape\u201d.\n\nBit by bit, Amazon dragged streaming ad prices down.\n\nIt kicked off last January when Prime Video started running ads. To lure marketers in, Amazon did what Amazon does \u2014 turned its rivals\u2019 margins into its own own advantage. The result? Rather than pay $39 to $45 per 1,000 viewers on Netflix, advertisers suddenly found themselves shelling out in the low-to-mid $30 rage, per the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting at the time. Just like that, Amazon reset the market.\n\nAt first, no one knew if this repricing of streaming ads would stick. Maybe prices would creep back up once Amazon settled in. They did \u2014 just not anywhere close to the heights streamers once enjoyed.\n\nCall it the Amazon effect.\n\nLike Disney, it made its main Prime Video subscription tier ad-supported. In doing so it shifted the foundation of its streaming business to advertising, unlocking more revenue per viewer, especially with a massive built-in audience of 115 million monthly U.S. viewers at the time. But unlike Disney, Amazon played a different game on price. Instead of going high, it flooded the market with cheaper inventory (50 billion ad impressions, according to MoffettNathanson). Advertisers jumped at the bargain, but not enough to soak up the sheer volume of impressions now available. More supply than demand never keeps prices high.\n\nNetflix has taken the biggest hit. eMarketer\u2019s analysis (see chart below) makes that abundantly clear. Since the first quarter of 2024 (i.e. when Prime Video introduced ads), Netflix CPMs have fallen more than those of Prime Video, Disney+, Max, Peacock and Hulu. They dropped from $42.14 to $31.05 by the end of the year. In comparison, Prime Video CPMs slid from $35.25 to $28.01.\n\nWhile streaming ad inventory is abundant, spending on these platforms, and the broader CTV market, is still growing. Even so, another dip isn\u2019t out of the question, though it likely won\u2019t be as steep as in 2024. Too many forces are still in play, from Amazon gaining more subscribers (and with them, more ad inventory) to its plan to introduce more ads during shows. More inventory always puts downward pressure on prices.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be anything as major as Amazon flipping a switch on a lot of ad inventory when it comes to driving prices down but there are definitely going to be other factors at work,\u201d said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at eMarketer. \u201cJust consider the fact that the streamers are pushing more people into ad-supported plans by raising the prices of their ad-free ones. That\u2019s going to create more ad inventory. Plus, more people are spending time streaming, not to mention the fact that there\u2019s more live sports on these services now. All of that is going to increase supply, which will probably reduce CPMs a little.\u201d\n\nFor now though, Amazon\u2019s gamble has clearly paid off. It didn\u2019t just surpass its $1.8 billion goal in ad spending commitments for its video streaming services including Prime Video last year, its total ad revenue topped $56.2 billion for the first time. But those gains weren\u2019t just ad dollars per se, they were about control. Marketers had more control over impressions and audiences than ever before following the arrival of ads on Prime Video.\n\n\u201cThe pricing levers Amazon offers allows us to make true apples-to-apples comparisons with other publishers like Netflix and Disney+, ensuring we\u2019re maximizing every advertising dollar for our clients,\u201d said Robert Avellino, vp of Innovation & Growth at Tinuiti. \u201cThis evolution isn\u2019t just about cost efficiency \u2014 it\u2019s about driving real outcomes at scale. We\u2019re excited to lean in even further in 2025 and continue unlocking the full potential of Amazon\u2019s STV offering.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not immediately return requests for comment.",

            "content": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nThe Walmart Birkin went viral on social media earlier this year after savvy shoppers discovered the Hermes handbag dupe on the department store site. Multiple variations of the iconic handbag were sold \u2014 and then quickly discontinued \u2014 on Walmart.com, after thousands of shoppers flooded the site to add the \u201cWirkin\u201d to cart.\n\nNow, a similar Birkin alternative has popped up online \u2014 this time on Amazon. The best news: this Birkin-style bag is still in-stock as of this writing.\n\nTRENDING RELEASE $176.68\n\nThis Amazon seller is listing a Birkin-like handbag, complete with the signature top flap, buckle clasps and structured boxy design. It even comes with a matching lanyard. Inside, find multiple compartments and pockets to help you organize your stuff. At just under 12 inches wide, the bag is ideal for the office, running errands and fancy nights out alike.\n\nAmazon says the bag is crafted from genuine leather, and this set includes an adjustable and removable shoulder strap. Amazon has multiple colorways available online, though we\u2019re partial to the rich brown shade seen above.\n\nVEGAN ALTERNATIVE $41.99\n\nThis $40 Birkin-like satchel above, is made from a vegan leather that looks just like the real thing. The material is scratch-resistant and tear-resistant and easily wipes down for cleaning. It\u2019s a good way to get the Birkin look with cruelty-free materials.\n\nTOP REVIEWED $88.99\n\nAmazon has a number of other Birkin-style bags online, including this above version which measures just under 10 inches in size and is made from a waterproof cowhide leather and Oxford cloth. The two-tone design adds visual appeal while offering a classic, Upper East Side look. This Birkin alternative on Amazon currently boasts all five-star reviews, with one shopper writing that she was \u201ccompletely surprised at the quality and craftsmanship of this purse.\u201d This bag is available in eight colors online.\n\nALSO CONSIDER $54.99\n\nIf you want the Birkin look but not an exact replica, Amazon shoppers like the \u201cLock & Charm\u201d bag above. It measures approximately 12 x 14 inches in size and is crafted from a textured vegan leather with durable stitching and reinforced base for durability. The lock closure in the center of the bag is just decorative, though a main zippered compartment helps you close the bag and keep your belongings in place. A bonus: this satchel bag includes a matching wristlet wallet. Choose from more than a dozen colors online. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nSPLURGE WORTHY $22,150\n\nOf course, even though the Walmart Birkin is no longer in stock (at least as of this writing), you can actually buy a real Birkin on Walmart.com. The site has teamed up with REBAG to offer authenticated, pre-loved luxury handbags and accessories. See their full selection here.\n\nOn an earnings call last week, Herm\u00e8s CEO Axel Dumas officially had \u201cno comment\u201d on the Walmart Birkin, though he let slip that he was \u201cirritated\u201d by copycat bags. Still, the CEO concedes that no one will believe that they are getting a real Herm\u00e8s bag, since sites like Walmart and Amazon aren\u2019t selling counterfeit versions, but rather similar-looking alternatives. Dumas added that it was \u201cquite touching\u201d to see the desire in shoppers to get their hands on the real thing.\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t have any authentic Birkin bags that we\u2019re seeing, though Amazon\u2019s Luxury Stores section has other real and verified Hermes bags and accessories.

Amazon MGM Studios is taking creative control over a certain secret agent.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Mister...\n\nROGER MOORE: (As James Bond) Bond. James Bond.\n\nRASCOE: For decades, the intellectual property rights to the 007 franchise belonged to a British American family. Now they're stepping back. It's big news for Bond fans across the pond, where Bond is actually from and where our correspondent Lauren Frayer reports.\n\nLAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: When news of Amazon's takeover of the Bond franchise hit the United Kingdom, the collective response sounded kind of like this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nFRANCIS: I nearly dropped me coffee, and I thought, Amazon Prime spinoff TV series?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: No, no, no.\n\nFRAYER: That's Francis from Norfolk, England, who called into a BBC talk radio program that did not include caller's surnames but did include their outrage. Another caller, Peter from Kent, England, said he fears this deal will lead to the Americanization of Bond. Imagine the horror.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPETER: They're probably going to turn it into another \"Bourne Identity\"-type thing and use it to boost American patriotism.\n\nFRAYER: A headline in The Daily Telegraph newspaper reads, Amazon's Bond takeover is an assault on Britishness. The article asks whether the next Bond might be played by Tom Cruise or even by Jeff Bezos. Maybe Bond will start calling his dinner jacket a tuxedo or even give up Martinis for Kentucky bourbon. That would be sacrilege, says Ajay Chowdhury, spokesperson for the James Bond International Fan Club, which is based in England, by the way.\n\nAJAY CHOWDHURY: You know, James Bond, especially in the U.K., is part of our cultural heritage. It's a cultural heirloom.\n\nFRAYER: After all, the creator of Bond was Ian Fleming, a Brit, though it was an American, Cubby Broccoli, who first brought Bond to the big screen in the 1960s. His British American heirs are the ones who are ceding creative control now to MGM Amazon. Chowdhury, the fan club spokesperson, compares the Broccoli family to one of the most beloved coaches in English football, and you will not hear him call it soccer.\n\nCHOWDHURY: Have done an amazing job - they're like the Alex Ferguson of the \"James Bond\" team. They're fantastic. They've been a great management, but they can't last forever. They were never going to.\n\nFRAYER: Speaking to the BBC, he then concluded with a joke. How many Bond fans does it take to change a light bulb? One, but 10 to complain about how much better the original was. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, London.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.

James Bond is going to work for Amazon.\n\nThis week it was announced that after 25 films, from Dr. No in 1962, with Sean Connery as the first to portray Ian Fleming's Bond, to No Time to Die in 2021 starring Daniel Craig, Amazon MGM Studios will take creative control of the James Bond franchise.\n\n\"We are honoured to continue this treasured heritage,\" Mike Hopkins, head of the studios, said in a statement that includes the Anglo \"u\" in honoured, \"and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmazon, of course, owns more than a hundred companies, including Whole Foods, Zappos, Twitch, and Woot!\n\nThe company is also, we must disclose, among NPR's financial supporters, though we cover them like we do any other business.\n\nSome voices in the entertainment industry expressed concern that Amazon might change the Bond franchise, perhaps by switching formats from movies to streaming series. But I think Amazon stewardship might offer creative possibilities for subtle promotion.\n\nUnder Amazon, 007 wouldn't have to be a license to kill, but a discount code.

With free shipping!\n\nAnd why should James Bond risk his life by leaping from the Eiffel Tower, or bungee jumping down a Swiss dam?\n\nThese days, Amazon can discover just about any intimate detail about an evil genius through algorithms gleaned from their searches for a shower caddy, light therapy lamp, and truffle salt.

            "content": "Who will be the next James Bond? Speculation mounts after Amazon buys 007\n\n1 day ago Paul Glynn Culture reporter\n\nGetty Images Thank you for your service: Daniel Craig served as James Bond across five films\n\n\"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\" That was the question posed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos this week to his 6.8 million followers on X. It is Bezos who will now have the final say on the next 007. He asked for suggestions alongside a screenshot of the BBC News story about his company gaining creative control of the famous spy film franchise. The choice of Daniel Craig's replacement will now be Amazon MGM Studios' biggest decision. So let's take a look at what direction the company could take, and who is in the frame.\n\nIf the replies to Bezos's call out are anything to go by, Henry Cavill is the (online) people's choice. The former Superman actor, who has said he \"would love to play Bond\", was widely regarded to have been the runner-up years ago when Craig landed the part for the first of his five 007 films, 2006's Casino Royale. The movie's director Martin Campbell told the Express last year that Cavill's audition was \"tremendous\" and that \"if Daniel didn't exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond\". There was just one problem. \"He just looked a little young at that time back then,\" added Campbell. Longstanding Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who announced on Thursday they were stepping down, have previously shot down the idea of a younger Bond. \"Remember, Bond's already a veteran,\" Wilson said in 2022. \"He's had some experience. He's a person who has been through the wars, so to speak. He's probably been in the SAS or something.\" Amazon may have different ideas - but at 41, Cavill could ironically now be considered too old, especially if he stays for a string of subsequent movies.\n\nGetty Images Could Henry Cavill go from playing Superman to James Bond?\n\nGetty Images James Norton has starred in Happy Valley, McMafia and Playing Nice\n\nGetty Images Aaron Taylor-Johnson's name has been regularly mentioned in relation to 007\n\nThe next most frequently mentioned names in the replies to Bezos were Tom Hardy, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Idris Elba. Taylor-Johnson, 34, known for roles in Kick-Ass and Kraven the Hunter, was at one stage rumoured to have been offered the job, but no announcement ever materialised. Kraven bombed at the box office last year, though, which could count against him. The bookmakers had Happy Valley actor James Norton listed as their favourite on Friday. Speaking on the red carpet at last weekend's Bafta Awards, Norton, 39, described the speculation around him becoming Bond as \"so weird and bemusing\" yet \"fun\".\n\n'Bring it younger'\n\nMark O'Connell, author of Catching Bullets: Memoirs of a Bond Fan, told the BBC he thinks Amazon - and whoever they choose as the next director - will go for a younger actor than in previous times, and he hopes they buy British again. \"Tom Hardy would be great, [but] I think he's, dare I say, too old,\" he said of the 47-year-old Mad Max actor. \"There's a lot of guys that keep getting quoted [and] I'm like, they're too old. \"I think Amazon's going to bring it younger. I think we're looking at early 30s. Paul Mescal is a good name. Kingsley Ben-Adir, who's one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, I'd keep an eye on him - he's got a sort of [Sean] Connery swagger about him.\n\n\"Harris Dickinson, who's a British actor doing well in Babygirl with Nicole Kidman at the moment, he's very British,\" O'Connell added. \"I hope they stick with the British DNA and origins of the role. I think they would be foolish to move away from that. But time will tell.\" Bond has been played by two non-British actors in the past - Australian George Lazenby and Irishman Pierce Brosnan. So don't rule out the likes of fellow Irish stars Mescal, Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, Aidan Turner, or Aussie Jacob Elordi. Could Amazon break the mould and go for the first American Bond? If so, Austin Butler has been mooted.\n\nGetty Images Paul Mescal starred in the recent Gladiator sequel\n\nGetty Images Kingsley Ben-Adir features in the Barbie film and played Bob Marley on the big screen\n\nOther Brits who have been shaken but not stirred into the mix include Challengers star Josh O'Connor, 34, and Babylon's Stuart Martin, 39, as well as White Lotus actor Theo James, who is 40. Callum Turner, Richard Madden, Will Poulter and Nicholas Hoult have also been suggested, among others.\n\n'Teasing Bond's masculine ego'\n\nSince Bond - originally the creation of author Ian Fleming - hit the big screen in 1962, first played by Scotsman Sean Connery, his hair and eye colour have changed, not to mention his accent. But so far, the character's skin colour and gender have remained fixed. That is apart from when Lashana Lynch briefly took over the 007 title from Craig's Bond in No Time to Die. \"James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male,\" Broccoli said in 2020. \"I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.\" She added: \"He should be British, so British can be any [ethnicity].\" Bridgerton actor Rege-Jean Page has been mooted alongside Ben-Adir as a possible first non-white Bond, as have Lucien Laviscount, Paapa Essiedu, Damson Idris, Riz Ahmed and Aaron Pierre. If Bezos does break Broccoli's rule and go for a woman, Cynthia Erivo would be a popular choice. However, Idris Elba, 52, the star of The Wire and Luther, said in 2023 that the racist backlash to the prospect of him being Bond \"made the whole thing disgusting and off-putting\".\n\nGetty Images Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the No Time To Die premiere in 2021\n\nIt's not just the lead role that the Amazon casting department will have to think about. \"In terms of what they could do with the women, I would love to see more interesting and nuanced female characters,\" said Monica German\u00e0, author of Bond Girls: Body, Fashion and Gender. \"There is a growing female fandom, so we want more interesting female characters teasing Bond's masculine ego.\" Then there are the villains, who are the characters with their \"pulse on the real world\", German\u00e0 said. \"They represent the anxieties we have about the world. So it'd be interesting what Amazon does with that. Will the next villain be, I don't know, will it be AI? Will it be something to do with climate change? Will it be far-right politics that they tap into?\"\n\n'Rediscover the fun'\n\nDebating the next James Bond is \"a national and international obsession\", BBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb told BBC Breakfast. \"I want to have an answer for you. I want to say names like Harris Dickinson or Leo Woodall and say, yes, it's going to be them. But it's all up in the air.\" Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine and podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live that while he \"admired what Craig has achieved\", he wants the new management \"to rediscover the fun of Bond\". Bond fan and author Ajay Chowdhury added: \"I think Bond ultimately is fantasy and it's fun and I think that entertainment value could be brought back.\" Bond bosses have often alternated between serious and lighter-hearted lead actors, he said. \"They always tend to reboot. You have a serious Bond [like Timothy] Dalton followed by a lighter Bond, Brosnan. Serious, Craig - and I think it's time to do that again.\"\n\nChowdhury thinks the new Bond will be \"an established British actor\" with what he calls \"the Goldilocks amount of fame\" - not too hot, not too cold. \"They'll have done TV and theatre across the Atlantic, but they won't be stars,\" he offers. \"They'll have just the right amount of fame and they'll be young enough to do three or four [films]. \"Who is it? We have no idea!\"",

Those unfortunately didn\u2019t stick around for very long before units began to sell out there too, but some of them are now back. While the entry-level 13-inch models are still mostly out of stock at Amazon, it has conjured up some 15-inch models in all colorways with 16GB of RAM and they are now back down at $1,099 shipped. That\u2019s $200 off the new $1,299 list price and $400 under the price they fetched before the RAM upgrade last fall.\n\nWe have already detailed the RAM situation a few times now for folks, but here\u2019s a refresher just in case you missed it: Apple upgraded the M3 MacBook Air lineup (along with the rest of them and the M2 Airs) last fall, finally being rid of the 8GB RAM configuration on the base model in favor of a 16GB setup, all without raising the price. That means you\u2019re effectively getting a configuration that was $1,499 not more than 5 months ago at $1,099.\n\nWhile there is more than a good chance we see Apple update the MacBook Air lineup with the newer M4 chip this year, perhaps in the spring, considering how popular the now previous-gen models have been among 9to5Toys readers and the dwindling stock on units at Apple Stores, we though it pertinent to ensure these deals were front and center for folks.\n\nHere\u2019s how pricing shakes out across the lineup right now \u2013 some offers are live at Amazon, some at Best Buy:\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air features:\n\nLEAN.

As a kitchen product tester and food writer, it was a special opportunity to build a well-curated wish list filled with high-ticket items like a KitchenAid Stand Mixer and Dutch oven that I\u2019d had my eye on for years. It felt like a dream shopping spree \u2014 without a budget.\n\nBut looking back at the gifts we received, it\u2019s actually been the little things getting the most use. More specifically, this magnetic measuring spoon set from Amazon has been an unsung hero in the kitchen. Ever since unwrapping it at our wedding shower, I\u2019ve been singing its praises to all of my family and friends, encouraging them to add it to their carts. And best of all \u2014 it\u2019s less than $8.\n\nBidful Magnetic Measuring Spoons Set\n\nAmazon\n\nA set of measuring spoons is an essential (albeit unglamorous) kitchen tool. Traditionally, the spoons come affixed together on a small ring, resembling a janitor\u2019s set of keys. This design is popular because it keeps the set together in numerical order, but it can be clunky when you just need one spoon and end up getting the entire set dirty.\n\nAlternatively, you can get a measuring spoon set that\u2019s completely detached, which often leads to them getting disorganized (and, in my case, lost) in your kitchen drawer.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this magnetic set a game-changer. The strong magnet on each spoon keeps them tightly organized when in storage, but they\u2019re still independent utensils that can be used and cleaned without the burden of bringing out the whole set. Better yet, each spoon has two sides, one rounded and one oval-headed shape. The former is ideal for liquid measuring, while the latter is perfect for fitting into narrow spice containers. This set also comes with a leveler for removing excess ingredients and ensuring utmost precision.\n\nThe 7-piece set suits all of my needs, but there\u2019s also an 8-piece set (which includes a \u00be teaspoon) and a 9-piece set (which includes both \u00be and 1/16 teaspoons). I love that each piece is stainless steel, which means they\u2019re built to last. The set also comes in a few stylish options: stainless steel with black labels, stainless steel with multicolor labels, and gold-brushed steel with black labels.\n\nWhether it\u2019s for measuring morning coffee grounds, leveling ingredients for homemade cookies, or following a weeknight dinner recipe, I find myself reaching for this measuring spoon set almost every single day \u2014 and I can\u2019t recommend it enough.\n\nShop More Baking Tools at Amazon\n\nSpring Chef Magnetic Stainless Steel Measuring Cups\n\nAmazon\n\nPyrex 3-Piece Glass Measuring Cup Set\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon Basics Silicone Non-Stick Reusable Baking Mat, Pack of 2\n\nAmazon\n\nEtekcity Food Kitchen Scale",

When Amazon bought MGM, there was a question of who would make the creative decisions moving forward.\n\nNow, Deadline is reporting a change in who is calling the shots.\n\nThere were a lot of rumors that Amazon wanted to spin Bond off for TV shows in the world and other characters. But the producers behind the scenes wanted to keep Bond and the movies feeling special, so they were against this dilution of the brand.\n\nProducers Broccoli and Wilson are co-owners of the franchise, but under a new agreement with MGM Amazon, they have relinquished control to the studio.\n\nWhile we can't be sure that MGM Amazon paid to control these rights, it was probably a lot of money, especially with all the opportunities in the Bond world.\n\nAmazon released a press release with a lot of positive quotes about the situation.\n\n\u201cSince his theatrical introduction over 60 years ago, James Bond has been one of the most iconic characters in filmed entertainment,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cWe are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide. We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects. Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future,\u201d said Wilson.\n\nBroccoli said, \u201cMy life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of No Time to Die and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\u201d\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how the Bond franchise moves forward now. Will they go after directors who want total control or work this into a TV series? What characters are on the table to adapt next?\n\nThe sky is the limit now that the studio has control.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments section.",

            "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller and his Duquesne Family Office has been a great hedge fund for investors to track. Because it has more than $100 million in assets, it is required to report holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of each quarter. Then, 45 days later, that information is released to the public in a form 13F so observers can track its moves.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Druckenmiller opened a new position in Amazon (AMZN -2.83%). Prior to the fourth quarter, he didn't own any Amazon shares. However, the fund bought $72 million worth of shares in the quarter, making it around 2% of the total portfolio value. I think this is a great move because Amazon has a ton going for it right now.\n\nAmazon's most important divisions are advertising and cloud computing\n\nWhen you hear Amazon, the first thing that pops into your mind is likely to be its e-commerce platform. This is the most public-facing part of the business, but I think there are far better reasons to own the stock.\n\nOne of them is that e-commerce doesn't provide a lot of growth. In the fourth quarter, the online-stores segment grew its revenue 7% year over year to $75.6 billion. That's still the company's largest segment by volume, but it grew the slowest of any of Alphabet's businesses. Instead, investors should focus on other divisions, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising.\n\nThese two divisions have grown to become massive chunks of the company's business, combining for $46.1 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. AWS recently overtook advertising as Amazon's fastest-growing segment, rising 19% year over year compared to advertising's 18% increase. However, the key point with both of these businesses is how much they boost profitability.\n\nWhile Amazon doesn't break out the profitability of its subscription service division, many companies (like Alphabet and Meta Platforms) derive a significant chunk of revenue from advertisements. These companies consistently post much higher profit margins than commerce companies, so it's clear that this segment boosts Amazon's profitability, too.\n\nLuckily for investors, management breaks out its AWS cloud computing segment's financials. In the fourth quarter alone, it generated $10.6 billion in operating profits. That accounted for 50% of the company's total operating profits, clearly a huge part of Amazon's income.\n\nHowever, the true effect of AWS is far greater than that. The fourth quarter is a strong commerce quarter due to the amount of holiday spending that Amazon experiences. This allows the company to produce a larger profit from these divisions.\n\nSo, to better understand how important AWS is to Amazon, let's look at the operating income produced over the past 12 months. Using that figure, AWS' share of operating profit rises to 58%. With that segment's growth expected to continue for many years, this should become the most important part of the business over the next few years.\n\nDruckenmiller knows this, which is probably one reason his firm opened a position in the fourth quarter. But is it still worth buying at today's prices?\n\nAmazon's stock doesn't appear to be cheap\n\nAs mentioned above, the snapshot of the Duquesne Family Office occurred on Dec. 31, 2024, but observers are just now learning about its moves. However, since the start of 2025, Amazon's stock has only risen around 3%, so the price hasn't changed much.\n\nAs for valuation, its stock trades for 36 times forward earnings.\n\nWhile this isn't a cheap stock by any means, it is cheaper than it has been in some time. Furthermore, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) isn't optimized because CEO Andy Jassy and his team are still working on making the commerce division more profitable.\n\nAnd investors know that Amazon's fastest-growing segment is far more profitable than its primary business. So, as this growth continues for many years, profit margins will naturally rise alongside it.\n\nThis means that the company's profit picture could be radically different five years from now, which is why investors like Druckenmiller are willing to take a position in a stock that looks a tad pricey compared to other big tech stocks. As a result, I think Amazon is a great buy today as long as investors are willing to hold on to shares for the long term (at least three to five years).",

For organizations deploying LLMs in production applications\u2014particularly in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, or legal services\u2014these residual hallucinations pose serious risks, potentially leading to misinformation, liability issues, and loss of user trust.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce a practical solution that combines the flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of drafted, curated, verified answers. Our solution uses two key Amazon Bedrock services: Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, a fully managed service that you can use to store, search, and retrieve organization-specific information for use with LLMs; and Amazon Bedrock Agents, a fully managed service that you can use to build, test, and deploy AI assistants that can understand user requests, break them down into steps, and execute actions. Similar to how a customer service team maintains a bank of carefully crafted answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), our solution first checks if a user\u2019s question matches curated and verified responses before letting the LLM generate a new answer. This approach helps prevent hallucinations by using trusted information whenever possible, while still allowing the LLM to handle new or unique questions. By implementing this technique, organizations can improve response accuracy, reduce response times, and lower costs. Whether you\u2019re new to AI development or an experienced practitioner, this post provides step-by-step guidance and code examples to help you build more reliable AI applications.\n\nSolution overview\n\nOur solution implements a verified semantic cache using the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Retrieve API to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while simultaneously improving latency and reducing costs. This read-only semantic cache acts as an intelligent intermediary layer between the user and Amazon Bedrock Agents, storing curated and verified question-answer pairs.\n\nWhen a user submits a query, the solution first evaluates its semantic similarity with existing verified questions in the knowledge base. For highly similar queries (greater than 80% match), the solution bypasses the LLM completely and returns the curated and verified answer directly. When partial matches (60\u201380% similarity) are found, the solution uses the verified answers as few-shot examples to guide the LLM\u2019s response, significantly improving accuracy and consistency. For queries with low similarity (less than 60%) or no match, the solution falls back to standard LLM processing, making sure that user questions receive appropriate responses.\n\nThis approach offers several key benefits:\n\nReduced costs: By minimizing unnecessary LLM invocations for frequently answered questions, the solution significantly reduces operational costs at scale\n\nBy minimizing unnecessary LLM invocations for frequently answered questions, the solution significantly reduces operational costs at scale Improved accuracy: Curated and verified answers minimize the possibility of hallucinations for known user queries, while few-shot prompting enhances accuracy for similar questions.\n\nCurated and verified answers minimize the possibility of hallucinations for known user queries, while few-shot prompting enhances accuracy for similar questions. Lower latency: Direct retrieval of cached answers provides near-instantaneous responses for known queries, improving the overall user experience.\n\nThe semantic cache serves as a growing repository of trusted responses, continuously improving the solution\u2019s reliability while maintaining efficiency in handling user queries.\n\nSolution architecture\n\nThe solution architecture in the preceding figure consists of the following components and workflow. Let\u2019s assume that the question \u201cWhat date will AWS re:invent 2024 occur?\u201d is within the verified semantic cache. The corresponding answer is also input as \u201cAWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2\u20136, 2024.\u201d Let\u2019s walkthrough an example of how this solution would handle a user\u2019s question.\n\n1. Query processing:\n\na. User submits a question \u201cWhen is re:Invent happening this year?\u201d, which is received by the Invoke Agent function.\n\nb. The function checks the semantic cache (Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases) using the Retrieve API.\n\nc. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases performs a semantic search and finds a similar question with an 85% similarity score.\n\n2. Response paths: (Based on the 85% similarity score in step 1.c, our solution follows the strong match path)\n\na. Strong match (similarity score greater than 80%):\n\ni. Invoke Agent function returns exactly the verified answer \u201cAWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2\u20136, 2024\u201d directly from the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, providing a deterministic response.\n\nii. No LLM invocation needed, response in less than 1 second.\n\nb. Partial match (similarity score 60\u201380%):\n\ni. The Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent through Amazon Bedrock Agents promptSessionAttributes.\n\nii. If the question was \u201cWhat\u2019s the schedule for AWS events in December?\u201d, our solution would provide the verified re:Invent dates to guide the Amazon Bedrock agent\u2019s response with additional context.\n\niii. Providing the Amazon Bedrock agent with a curated and verified example might help increase accuracy.\n\nc. No match (similarity score less than 60%):\n\ni. If the user\u2019s question isn\u2019t similar to any of the curated and verified questions in the cache, the Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent without providing it any additional context from cache.\n\nii. For example, if the question was \u201cWhat hotels are near re:Invent?\u201d, our solution would invoke the Amazon Bedrock agent directly, and the agent would use the tools at its disposal to formulate a response.\n\n3. Offline knowledge management:\n\na. Verified question-answer pairs are stored in a verified Q&A Amazon S3 bucket (Amazon Simple Storage Service), and must be updated or reviewed periodically to make sure that the cache contains the most recent and accurate information.\n\nb. The S3 bucket is periodically synchronized with the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This offline batch process makes sure that the semantic cache remains up-to-date without impacting real-time operations.\n\nSolution walkthrough\n\nYou need to meet the following prerequisites for the walkthrough:\n\nAn AWS account\n\nModel access to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet V1 and Amazon Titan Text Embedding V2\n\nAWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed and configured with the appropriate credentials\n\nOnce you have the prerequisites in place, use the following steps to set up the solution in your AWS account.\n\nStep 0: Set up the necessary infrastructure\n\nFollow the \u201cGetting started\u201d instructions in the README of the Git repository to set up the infrastructure for this solution. All the following code samples are extracted from the Jupyter notebook in this repository.\n\nStep 1: Set up two Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases\n\nThis step creates two Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases. The agent knowledge base stores Amazon Bedrock service documentation, while the cache knowledge base contains curated and verified question-answer pairs. This setup uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services.\n\nagent_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase( kb_name=agent_knowledge_base_name, kb_description=\"Knowledge base used by Bedrock Agent\", data_bucket_name=agent_bucket_name, chunking_strategy=\"FIXED_SIZE\", suffix=f'{agent_unique_id}-f' ) cache_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase( kb_name=cache_knowledge_base_name, kb_description=\"Verified cache for Bedrock Agent System\", data_bucket_name=cache_bucket_name, chunking_strategy=\"NONE\", # We do not want to chunk our question-answer pairs suffix=f'{cache_unique_id}-f' )\n\nThis establishes the foundation for your semantic caching solution, setting up the AWS resources to store the agent\u2019s knowledge and verified cache entries.\n\nStep 2: Populate the agent knowledge base and associate it with an Amazon Bedrock agent\n\nFor this walkthrough, you will create an LLM Amazon Bedrock agent specialized in answering questions about Amazon Bedrock. For this example, you will ingest Amazon Bedrock documentation in the form of the User Guide PDF into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This will be the primary dataset. After ingesting the data, you create an agent with specific instructions:\n\nagent_instruction = \"\"\"You are the Amazon Bedrock Agent. You have access to a knowledge base with information about the Amazon Bedrock service on AWS. Use it to answer questions.\"\"\" agent_id = agents_handler.create_agent( agent_name, agent_description, agent_instruction, [agent_foundation_model], kb_arns=[agent_kb_arn] # Associate agent with our Agent knowledge base )\n\nThis setup enables the Amazon Bedrock agent to use the ingested knowledge to provide responses about Amazon Bedrock services. To test it, you can ask a question that isn\u2019t present in the agent\u2019s knowledge base, making the LLM either refuse to answer or hallucinate.\n\ninvoke_agent(\"What are the dates for reinvent 2024?\", session_id=\"test\") # Response: Unfortunately, the dates for the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference have not # been announced yet by Amazon. The re:Invent conference is typically held in late # November or early December each year, but the specific dates for 2024 are not # available at this time. AWS usually announces the dates for their upcoming # re:Invent event around 6-9 months in advance.\n\nStep 3: Create a cache dataset with known question-answer pairs and populate the cache knowledge base\n\nIn this step, you create a raw dataset of verified question-answer pairs that aren\u2019t present in the agent knowledge base. These curated and verified answers serve as our semantic cache to prevent hallucinations on known topics. Good candidates for inclusion in this cache are:\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs): Common queries that users often ask, which can be answered consistently and accurately. Critical questions requiring deterministic answers: Topics where precision is crucial, such as pricing information, service limits, or compliance details. Time-sensitive information: Recent updates, announcements, or temporary changes that might not be reflected in the main RAG knowledge base.\n\nBy carefully curating this cache with high-quality, verified answers to such questions, you can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of your solution\u2019s responses. For this walkthrough, use the following example pairs for the cache:\n\nQ: 'What are the dates for reinvent 2024?'\n\nA: 'The AWS re:Invent conference was held from December 2-6 in 2024.'\n\nQ: 'What was the biggest new feature announcement for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?'\n\nA: 'During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock Agents was the custom orchestrator. This key feature allows users to implement their own orchestration strategies through AWS Lambda functions, providing granular control over task planning, completion, and verification while enabling real-time adjustments and reusability across multiple agents.'\n\nYou then format these pairs as individual text files with corresponding metadata JSON files, upload them to an S3 bucket, and ingest them into your cache knowledge base. This process makes sure that your semantic cache is populated with accurate, curated, and verified information that can be quickly retrieved to answer user queries or guide the agent\u2019s responses.\n\nStep 4: Implement the verified semantic cache logic\n\nIn this step, you implement the core logic of your verified semantic cache solution. You create a function that integrates the semantic cache with your Amazon Bedrock agent, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and consistent responses.\n\nQueries the cache knowledge base for similar entries to the user question. If a high similarity match is found (greater than 80%), it returns the cached answer directly. For partial matches (60\u201380%), it uses the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent. For low similarity (less than 60%), it falls back to standard agent processing.\n\nThis simplified logic forms the core of the semantic caching solution, efficiently using curated and verified information to improve response accuracy and reduce unnecessary LLM invocations.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate results and performance\n\nThis step demonstrates the effectiveness of the verified semantic cache solution by testing it with different scenarios and comparing the results and latency. You\u2019ll use three test cases to showcase the solution\u2019s behavior:\n\nStrong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity) Partial semantic match (60-80% similarity) No semantic match (less than 60% similarity)\n\nHere are the results:\n\nStrong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity) provides the exact curated and verified answer in less than 1 second. %%time invoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What were some new features announced for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?\") # Output: # Cache semantic similarity log: Strong match with score 0.9176399 # CPU times: user 20.7 ms, sys: 442 \u03bcs, total: 21.1 ms # Wall time: 440 ms # During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock # Agents was the custom orchestrator. This key feature allows users to implement # their own orchestration strategies through AWS Lambda functions, providing # granular control over task planning, completion, and verification while enabling # real-time adjustments and reusability across multiple agents. Partial semantic match (60\u201380% similarity) passes the verified answer to the LLM during the invocation. The Amazon Bedrock agent answers the question correctly using the cached answer even though the information is not present in the agent knowledge base. %%time invoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What are the newest features for Bedrock Agents?\") # Output: # Cache semantic similarity log: Partial match with score 0.6443664 # CPU times: user 10.4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 10.4 ms # Wall time: 12.8 s # One of the newest and most significant features for Amazon Bedrock Agents # announced during re:Invent 2024 was the custom orchestrator. This feature # allows users to implement their own orchestration strategies through AWS # Lambda functions, providing granular control over task planning, completion, # and verification. It enables real-time adjustments and reusability across # multiple agents, enhancing the flexibility and power of Bedrock Agents. No semantic match (less than 60% similarity) invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent as usual. For this query, the LLM will either refuse to provide the information because it\u2019s not present in the agent\u2019s knowledge base, or will hallucinate and provide a response that is plausible but incorrect. %%time invoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"Tell me about a new feature for Amazon Bedrock Agents\") # Output: # Cache semantic similarity log: No match with score 0.532105 # CPU times: user 22.3 ms, sys: 579 \u03bcs, total: 22.9 ms # Wall time: 13.6 s # Amazon Bedrock is a service that provides secure and scalable compute capacity # for running applications on AWS. As for new features for the Bedrock Agents # component, I do not have any specific information on recent or upcoming new # features. However, AWS services are frequently updated with new capabilities, # so it's possible there could be new agent features released in the future to # enhance security, scalability, or integration with other AWS services. Without # being able to consult the Knowledge Base, I cannot provide details on any # particular new Bedrock Agent features at this time.\n\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of the semantic caching solution:\n\nStrong matches provide near-instant, accurate, and deterministic responses without invoking an LLM. Partial matches guide the LLM agent to provide a more relevant or accurate answer. No matches fall back to standard LLM agent processing, maintaining flexibility.\n\nThe semantic cache significantly reduces latency for known questions and improves accuracy for similar queries, while still allowing the agent to handle unique questions when necessary.\n\nStep 6: Resource clean up\n\nMake sure that the Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases that you created, along with the underlying Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections are deleted to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.\n\nProduction readiness considerations\n\nBefore deploying this solution in production, address these key considerations:\n\nSimilarity threshold optimization: Experiment with different thresholds to balance cache hit rates and accuracy. This directly impacts the solution\u2019s effectiveness in preventing hallucinations while maintaining relevance. Feedback loop implementation: Create a mechanism to continuously update the verified cache with new, accurate responses. This helps prevent cache staleness and maintains the solution\u2019s integrity as a source of truth for the LLM. Cache management and update strategy: Regularly refresh the semantic cache with current, frequently asked questions to maintain relevance and improve hit rates. Implement a systematic process for reviewing, validating, and incorporating new entries to help ensure cache quality and alignment with evolving user needs. Ongoing tuning: Adjust similarity thresholds as your dataset evolves. Treat the semantic cache as a dynamic component, requiring continuous optimization for your specific use case.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis verified semantic cache approach offers a powerful solution to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while improving latency and reducing costs. By using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can implement a solution that can efficiently serve curated and verified answers, guide LLM responses with few-shot examples, and gracefully fall back to full LLM processing when needed.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nDheer Toprani is a System Development Engineer within the Amazon Worldwide Returns and ReCommerce Data Services team.

But the ones that interest me the most are when a creator takes products that are easily available to everyone and relatively cheap and puts them together to create a monster\u2014I'm not finding a Hayabusa engine to stick in a kei truck.\n\nThankfully, in this video, the folks at BOOM kept it simple and affordable. I love how they started out with a rolling minibike frame, meaning they didn't have to pull out a perfectly good engine for the swap and waste money. The kit included everything except an engine and cost $677. The next task was to pair this with an engine.\n\nThe lads opted for a 196cc diesel engine from Amazon, which cost $110. The air-cooled powerplant doesn't scream \"high-performance,\" and it's not. Once it was jerry-rigged into the minibike's rolling chassis, the lads recorded a top speed of 6 mph, which is, well, terrible.\n\nIn an effort to significantly boost the bike's top speed, the guys at BOOM bought Amazon's cheapest turbocharger, which cost just $129.99. The hope was to hit 20 mph, which would be an increase of more than 300% over the original top speed. But, at such a low retail price, it's hard to imagine that the turbo would do much if anything at all.\n\nPause for a moment and take a guess as to what speed you think the minibike hit on its top-speed run, then watch the video below.\n\nA $129.99 turbocharger resulted in a top speed increase of 400%. Now that's value for money. In fact, the whole build only cost $916.99, and considering how it tackled the off-road section at the end of the video, I think it's pretty decent value for money.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

He is charged with negligent and reckless driving and more charges are pending.\n\nOn Friday, court officials said he was held without bail.\n\nHit-and-run caught on camera\n\nA video obtained by WJZ captured the moment as the van slowly ran over the woman at the intersection of E. Pratt and S.

The news was first announced in November as a way to offer multiple avenues for fans to access games.\n\nThe new streaming option costs $19.99 per month with a seven-day free trial, which is the same price as the monthly plan directly through FanDuel Sports Network Detroit. A season pass and an annual pricing plan will be announced at a later date according to Main Street Sports Group, previously known as Diamond Sports Group.\n\nHow to get Prime Video\n\nFans will also be able to buy single-game passes through the FanDuel Sports Network app for $6.99 for the NBA and NHL, though it is not available for MLB. Single-game purchases will not be available on Amazon Prime. Single-game purchases became available through FanDuel Sports Network in December.\n\nFanDuel Sports Network will remain available through cable and streaming through the FDSN app. To access it through Amazon Prime, you must purchase the bundle as an add-on to your account, meaning you cannot log in through Prime with an already existing FanDuel Sports Network account.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for new and innovative ways to serve our teams and viewers,\u201d said Eric Ratchman, President of Distribution and Business Development for Main Street Sports Group, in a released statement. \u201cThis relationship with Prime Video gives fans another way to watch their favorite local teams and underscores the essential role our distribution partners play in driving our future growth. We\u2019re excited to offer a seamless and convenient way to stay in the game.\u201d\n\nThe timing comes as all three Detroit teams will start showing up on FanDuel Sports Network. The Pistons and Red Wings return from their respective midseason breaks for the NBA All-Star Game and hockey's 4 Nations tournament this weekend. Both teams are in the playoff hunt entering the final stretch of the 2024-25 season.\n\nREAD MORE: Tigers first full-squad workout begins with higher expectations, more experience\n\nThe Tigers began full-squad spring training workouts this week, and will have their first televised game in the Grapefruit League on Sunday against the New York Yankees in Tampa, Florida.

This spurred a wave of public backlash against the named technology platforms, which include adtech firms Google, Amazon, Integral Ad Science, and Double Verify, as well as the certification bodies Media Rating Council and Trustworthy Accountability Group.\n\nIn response, Amazon will update its DSP to include new page-level reporting through its Traffic Events API, according to Digiday. The enhanced level of reporting\u2014at the specific page, rather than the website more broadly\u2014will give ad buyers more visibility into the content that appears alongside their ads.\n\nOffering this level of granularity is critical for both reducing the likelihood of these kinds of abuses and ensuring there is accountability for them if they do happen again. But to guarantee that CSAM is flagged and demonetized, the entire digital supply chain will have to enhance its transparency\u2014not just DSPs.\n\n\u201cWe regret that this occurred and took swift action to block these websites from showing our ads,\u201d an Amazon Ads spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe have strict policies in place against serving ads on content of this nature, and we are taking additional steps to help ensure this does not happen in the future,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cThis affected a tiny portion of advertising spend for a small number of advertisers, and we have refunded all advertisers whose ads appeared on these websites.\u201d\n\nOther named firms, including DoubleVerify, Google, and IAS, have offered new categories, updated their policy language, and announced forthcoming changes to their technology suite to prevent CSAM concerns in the future.\n\nBut so far, Amazon is the first of the accused companies to offer page-level reporting, which ad buyers and industry critics have long called for.",

While DSPs and measurement firms have been under fire, media buyers also note that it\u2019s up to the supply side to offer full-path URL reporting.\n\nA spokesperson for IAS said it already offers URL-level reporting by default for customers using its Brand Suitability tech across content labeled by IAS as unsafe or unsuitable for measurement on the open web.\n\n\u201cThe definition of brand suitability is defined by each customer,\u201d the IAS spokesperson said. \u201cFull URL reporting has been available since 2021, and we are continuing to drive adoption to support our customers with this level of transparency.\u201d\n\nSome media buyers say it\u2019s too soon to tell if changes by Amazon or others will have an impact.

            "content": "Following over a decade of inability to compete with Apple and Google, Amazon has finally announced that it will be shutting down its Appstore for Android smartphones.\n\nStarting Aug. 20, users will no longer be able to download or access content from the Amazon Appstore on their smartphones. This is in addition to Amazon shutting down its digital currency, Amazon Coins, which represents a total withdrawal from its smartphone app plans.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Amazon Appstore\n\nWhen the Amazon Appstore debuted in 2011, it was determined to be a viable competitor to Google's Android Market (now Google Play Store), TechCrunch reports.\n\nAmazon attracted users with unique app discounts, high-end giveaways, and its own digital currency, Amazon Coins. The Appstore never achieved any real momentum, though, because of some key challenges.\n\nFirst, there's no Google Play Services. Users go to this to download apps they want to access, but Amazon's platform failed to do so. Another problem is the clunky installation procedure where users need to sideload an APK. Some people left because of this issue.\n\nAmazon Appstore also has fewer content and features. The company did not develop it as Google Play and other competitors continue to improve each year.\n\nWith time, the user base eroded, and the Appstore became an afterthought in the mobile market. By the announcement of its shutdown, it was reported that the Appstore was only installed on 0.1% of Android devices.\n\nWhat Happens to Existing Amazon Appstore Users?\n\nFor the time being, users who downloaded content from the Amazon Appstore can still use their apps and games. Nevertheless, after August 2025, there are no assurances that they will still be functional on Android devices.\n\nAccording to PC Gamer, Amazon has already ceased selling Amazon Coins, but users who have them remaining in their accounts can spend them or get refunds when the shutdown goes into effect.\n\nA Strategic Exit Amid Google's Antitrust Case\n\nAmazon's announcement to close down its Appstore is timely, given that Google is under antitrust investigation for its control of the app distribution market.\n\nWhile suing Epic Games in 2023, Google cited the Amazon Appstore as evidence that other marketplaces existed. Epic argued back that Amazon's store was essentially nonexistent in the Android environment, which destroyed Google's claim.\n\nWith Google under threat to provide third-party app stores with more access to Android, platforms such as Epic Games and Microsoft may be able to gain. Amazon, however, has opted to bail rather than struggle for relevance in this new landscape.\n\nWhat Will Happen to Fire Devices and Amazon's App Ecosystem\n\nThough Amazon is cutting loose its Appstore for smartphones, it's not fully closing down its app distribution operation. It still depends on its Appstore for Fire tablets and Fire TV, the two devices that use a diluted version of Android called Fire OS.\n\nAmazon does not label Fire OS as Android, yet its devices depend on Android-based applications. Since Fire tablets and Fire TV sticks lack Google Play availability, the Amazon Appstore will continue to be operational for these devices.\n\nThis shutdown will perhaps be a source of disappointment to developers who took time and effort to make their apps available for the Amazon Appstore. Though the adoption level of the Appstore is quite low, this financial effect will be negligible.",

Amazon, meanwhile, reported sales of $187.8 billion for its December-ended fourth quarter earlier this month.\n\nWalmart has topped lists of largest companies by revenue, such as the Fortune 500, every year since 2014. It will extend that crown for 2024, with Walmart's total sales of $680.99 billion staving off Amazon's $637.96 billion.\n\nStill, this is the first time Amazon has beat Walmart's sales on a quarterly basis. Amazon's Q4 includes more of the early holiday shopping calendar, however, than Walmart's November through January period.\n\nBut the race is on for the rest of the year. Walmart's fast-growing e-commerce business is attempting to win share in a U.S. market still dominated by Amazon. Of course, the businesses have key differences. Amazon has a massive cloud computing arm while Walmart has the world's largest footprint of physical stores.\n\nAnalysts project Amazon will post full-year sales of $700.8 billion, according to FactSet. Walmart is projected for $708.7 billion in sales for its current January-ending fiscal year. Analyst estimates will likely be updated following Thursday's report.\n\nAmazon Stock Slumps\n\nRather than celebrating, Amazon investors appear to be more concerned about Walmart's soft guidance and what it means for consumer spending. Amazon stock slipped more than 1.5% to close at 222.88 on the stock market today. Walmart stock lost more than 6.5%.\n\nAmazon stock has slumped since its Q4 report, which also included a lighter-than-expected sales and profit outlook for the current quarter. Shares are down 7% from a high of 242.52 near the start of the month.\n\nAmazon broke below its 50-day moving average on Tuesday and has fallen further past the key trendline in trading action since then.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAlibaba Stock Jumps Following Earnings Beat, Strong AI Cloud Growth\n\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy?\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nWalmart Stock, Costco Roar As They Create Amazon-Like Businesses",

            "content": "I enter the Thyssen Museum in Madrid to see the exhibition about Gabriele M\u00fcnter. She is one of the great painters of German Expressionism, who has finally been placed on an equal level with her male colleagues. Lately, several museums have organized major exhibitions of her work. Last year it was the Leopold Museum in Vienna, this year, in addition to the Thyssen in Madrid, the Guggenheim in New York will open a major retrospective of the painter in November, which will be called Into Deep Waters.\n\nFrom the very first paintings I look at, such as Breakfast of the Birds, I am reminded of the house where Gabriele lived with Wassily Kandinsky, in the small town of Murnau that I visited in the winter of last year. Kandinsky was her painting teacher and became her partner.\n\nAfter traveling together through Europe and North Africa, the couple decided they needed a house where they could paint and lead a stable life. They fell in love with Murnau, a village on the shores of Lake Staffelsee at the foot of the Bavarian Alps. Gabriele bought the yellow house, built in the style of the local chalets, and they lived there from 1908 onwards. They became inseparable friends of Russian painters Marianne von Werefkin and Alexej von Jawlensky (also a couple) possessed as they all were by the excitement of portraying landscapes and human figures in a way that had never been done before.\n\nI look at the many paintings of snowy landscapes on display at the M\u00fcnter exhibition in Madrid and I remember the whiteness of the snow-covered fields and frozen lakes of Murnau with their faint winter light. On entering the snowy garden of the house-museum, I was struck by the paintings on the furniture and the wooden stairs. In the explanations offered by the house-museum, I read that, on acquiring the house, the couple set to work painting the walls and decorating the furniture. Indeed, the interior of the house, which that day contrasted so much with the quiet, white landscapes, is in itself a work of art: the walls of the rooms are a riot of bright colors \u2013 reds, blues, greens \u2013 and the wooden stairs, like the rustic furniture, are adorned with paintings of horsemen, trees and flowers.\n\nI move on to another room in the exhibition and stop in front of the painting Boat Trip, with Gabriele rowing with her back to me, Kandinsky standing in the boat and two other people: Marianne Werefkin and Jawlensky\u2019s son. Then I think of all the artists who came to the yellow house; the composer Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg was a regular visitor, as were the painters Macke and Franz Marc, who together with their hosts founded the group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) a key group in modern expressionism. All those creators who visited Gabriele and Kandinsky, and whose portraits hang on the walls of the yellow house, gave a new direction to 20th-century art. Some, like Kandinsky and Jawlensky, took their spiritual quest in a new direction: abstract art.\n\nIn 1914 the war put an end to the joy and vitality of the group. From one day to the next, Kandinsky, as a Russian citizen, had become an enemy of Germany and after a few months with Gabriele in neutral Switzerland, he returned alone to Russia where he married. Gabriele spent the war years in Stockholm.\n\nDuring Nazism and the Second World War, the painter had managed to save her paintings, those of Kandinsky and those of other expressionists, labeled by the Nazis as degenerate art, by hiding them in the basement of her house, with the help of her husband, the art historian Johannes Eichner. The Gestapo, which carried out several raids on the house, did not discover the treasure. When Gabriele turned 80 in 1957, she bequeathed her collection to the St\u00e4dtliche Galerie in Munich. The painter spent the rest of her life in Murnau, where she died in 1962.",

It was shot in the Agoura Hills suburb of Los Angeles.\n\nSeason one showrunner Cody Heller previously told THR she was \u201cterrified\u201d by the challenge of pulling off the candid camera feat. \u201cThere was something about that fear of failure that ignited something in myself,\u201d she said.

CEO Eddie Wu attributed that shiny result to growth in the company's cloud business and its triple-digit expansion in artificial intelligence during the past six quarters, though increasing retail sales also played a part.\n\nAmazon, like Alibaba, wears dual hats of retailer and cloud provider. The company's retail unit is its biggest moneymaker \u2014 but revenue is also fueled by its cloud computing services. In late 2024, Amazon's quarterly revenue surpassed Walmart's for the first time, in an indication that tech conglomerate is making inroads into more parts of the economy.\n\nWalmart, however, is still expected to be the world's largest annual revenue generator \u2014 for now.\n\nWhat you need to know today\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nU.S. markets retreat from records\n\nU.S. markets dropped Thursday. The S&P 500 was down 0.43%, retreating from recent highs and putting it in the red for the week thus far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.01% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.47%. Asia-Pacific stocks climbed Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index popped more than 3.4% to its highest level since February 2022, on the back of Alibaba shares surging. Japan's Nikkei 225 added around 0.2% amid sustained consumer price growth.\n\nSustained inflation in Japan\n\nJapan's inflation rate in January climbed to 4% year on year, hitting its highest level since January 2023. Core inflation \u2014 which excludes prices of fresh food \u2014 rose to 3.2%, beating economists' expectations of 3.1%, according to a Reuters poll. This figure was the highest since June 2023. The headline inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 34 straight months.\n\nAlibaba shares pop on cloud growth\n\nAlibaba shot up 8.1% in U.S. on Thursday and jumped as much as 12% in Hong Kong on Friday. The Chinese tech giant on Thursday reported net income of 48.945 billion yuan ($6.72 billion) in the December quarter, a 239% surge from a year ago. Alibaba's top line was also better than expected, lifted by 13% year-on-year sales growth in its Cloud Intelligence Group during the quarter. Separately, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen increased his personal stake in Alibaba to around $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nAmazon's quarterly revenue beats Walmart's\n\nAmazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter \u2014 above the $180.5 billion reported by Walmart on Thursday. Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.\n\nTaking Thames private\n\nPrivate equity investor KKR is offering about \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) for U.K.'s struggling Thames Water utility, according to a person familiar with the matter. The water utility firm is saddled with ballooning debt and has warned it will run out of cash by March 24. KKR's involvement would comprise a \u00a34 billion management-buyout submission that would not result in the sale of assets or a breakup of the utility, the source said.\n\n[PRO] Behind Thursday's sell-off\n\nWalmart, as the U.S.' largest retailer and generator of revenue, serves as a bellwether for consumer health. So when the company said it expects profit growth to slow this fiscal year, investors took notice and sold off shares. Here's what analysts think of the dip in markets on Thursday.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nYuri Kadobnov | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMoscow loathed the U.S. for years as its economy paid a high price for war \u2014 now, it's doing a U-turn\n\nSince invading Ukraine three years ago, Russia has spent a significant amount of energy demonizing the U.S. and denigrating the country. But the arrival of a friendlier administration under U.S. President Donald Trump, which kickstarted fledgling talks to end the conflict in Ukraine \u2014 as well as a way in from the economic and geopolitical cold \u2014 are prompting a softening of the Kremlin's adversarial stance.\n\nAs tensions between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spilled into open acrimony on Wednesday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" Putin praised Trump for showing restraint amid what he described as \"hysteria\" by European leaders who are angry at being left out of negotiations on Ukraine's future.",

By the time I got there, people were already there.\"\n\nAccording to police, Young stopped the van, checked on the woman, got back in, and drove off.\n\nAccording to police records, the woman told the responding officer that when Young approached her, he asked \"How did you manage to get hit,\" before getting back in the van and leaving.\n\nShe also said she felt the van run over her head and then again over her body.\n\nWitnesses said a passerby helped the woman, took photos of the truck, and assisted in the investigation.\n\nThe woman was taken to a hospital where she is expected to survive, police said.

            "content": "At AWS re:Invent 2024, we launched a new innovation in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) that enables you to run generative AI development tasks on shared accelerated compute resources efficiently and reduce costs by up to 40%. Administrators can use SageMaker HyperPod task governance to govern allocation of accelerated compute to teams and projects, and enforce policies that determine the priorities across different types of tasks. The resulting improvement in utilization of compute resources enables organizations to focus on accelerating their generative AI innovation and time to market, instead of spending time coordinating resource allocation and continuously replanning their generative AI development tasks.\n\nIn this post, we provide best practices to maximize the value of SageMaker HyperPod task governance and make the administration and data science experiences seamless. We also discuss common governance scenarios when administering and running generative AI development tasks.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo get started with SageMaker HyperPod task governance on an existing SageMaker HyperPod cluster orchestrated by Amazon EKS, make sure you uninstall any existing Kueue installations, and have a Kubernetes cluster running version 1.30+.\n\nAdministration experience\n\nAdministrators are the first persona interacting with SageMaker HyperPod task governance. They are responsible for managing the cluster compute allocation according to the organization\u2019s priorities and goals.\n\nManaging compute\n\nThe first step to managing capacity across teams is to set up compute allocations. When setting up a compute allocation, keep in mind the following considerations:\n\nWhat type of tasks does this team typically run?\n\nDoes this team constantly run tasks and require reserved capacity?\n\nWhat is this team\u2019s priority relative to other teams?\n\nWhen setting up a compute allocation, an administrator sets the team\u2019s fair-share weight, which provides relative prioritization comparative to other teams when vying for the same idle compute. Higher weight enables a team to access unutilized resources within shared capacity sooner. As a best practice, set the fair-share weight higher for teams that will require access to capacity sooner than other teams.\n\nAfter the fair-share weight is set, the administrator then sets up the quota and borrowing strategy. Quota determines the allocation per instance type within the cluster\u2019s instance groups. Borrowing strategy determines whether a team will share or reserve their allotted capacity. To enforce proper quota management, the total reserved quota should not surpass the cluster\u2019s available capacity for that resource. For instance, if a cluster comprises 20 ml.c5.2xlarge instances, the cumulative quota assigned to teams should remain under 20.\n\nIf the compute allocations for teams allow for \u201cLend and Borrow\u201d or \u201cLend,\u201d the idle capacity is shared between these teams. For example, if Team A has a quota of 6 but is using only 2 for its tasks, and Team B has a quota of 5 and is using 4 for its tasks, and a task that is submitted to Team B requiring 4 resources, 3 will be borrowed from Team A based on its \u201cLend and Borrow\u201d settings. If any team\u2019s compute allocations setting is set to \u201cDon\u2019t Lend,\u201d the team will not be able to borrow any additional capacity beyond its reserved capacity.\n\nTo maintain a pool or a set of resources that all teams can borrow from, users can set up a dedicated team with resources that bridge the gap between other teams\u2019 allocations and the total cluster capacity. Make sure that this cumulative resource allocation includes the appropriate instance types and doesn\u2019t exceed the total cluster capacity. To make sure that these resources can be shared among teams, enable the participating teams to have their compute allocations set to \u201cLend and Borrow\u201d or \u201cLend\u201d for this common pool of resources. In addition, every time new teams are introduced, or quota allocations are changed or there are any changes to the cluster capacity, revisit the quota allocations of all the teams, to make sure the cumulative quota remains at or below cluster capacity.\n\nAfter compute allocations have been set, the administrator will also need to set a cluster policy, which is comprised of two components: task prioritization and idle compute allocation. Administrators will set up a task prioritization, which determines the priority level for tasks running in a cluster. Next, an administrator will set idle compute allocation setting to either \u201cfirst come, first serve,\u201d in which tasks are not prioritized, or \u201cfair-share allocation,\u201d in which idle compute is distributed to teams based on their fair-share weight.\n\nObservability\n\nTo get started with observability, install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability add-on with Kueue metrics selected. The SageMaker HyperPod task governance dashboard provides a single pane of glass view for cluster utilization across teams. At present, you can view tasks running for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MPI tasks. Administrators can analyze the graphs within the dashboard to understand equity in resource sharing and utilization of resources.\n\nTo view utilization of resources, users can see the following dashboard showing GPU and vCPU utilization. These graphs inform administrators where teams can further maximize their GPU utilization. In this example, administrators observe GPU utilization around 52%\n\nAdministrators have a real-time view of utilization of instances as tasks are running or moved to pending during preemption. In this example, the ML engineering team is borrowing 5 GPUs for their training task\n\nWith SageMaker HyperPod, you can additionally set up observability tools of your choice. In our public workshop, we have steps on how to set up Amazon Managed Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.\n\nData scientist experience\n\nData scientists are the second persona interacting with SageMaker HyperPod clusters. Data scientists are responsible for the training, fine-tuning, and deployment of models on accelerated compute instances. It\u2019s important to make sure data scientists have the necessary capacity and permissions when interacting with clusters of GPUs.\n\nAccess control\n\nWhen working with SageMaker HyperPod task governance, data scientists will assume their specific role. Each data science team will need to have their own role and associated role-based access control (RBAC) on the cluster. RBAC prevents data scientists from submitting tasks to teams in which they do not belong. For more information about data science role permissions, see AWS Identity and Access Management for SageMaker HyperPod. As a best practice, administrators should limit data scientists according to the principle of least privilege. After roles and access entries are set up, data scientists can assume their associated AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to submit tasks to corresponding namespaces. It\u2019s important to note that users interacting with the console dashboard who didn\u2019t create the associated EKS cluster will need to have their role added to the AccessEntry list for the EKS cluster.\n\nSubmitting tasks\n\nThere are two ways to submit tasks on Amazon EKS orchestrated SageMaker HyperPod clusters: kubectl and the SageMaker HyperPod CLI. With both options, data scientists will need to reference their team\u2019s namespace and task priority class in the task configuration file in order to use their allocated quota with appropriate prioritization. If the user doesn\u2019t a specify priority class, then SageMaker HyperPod task governance will automatically assume the lowest priority.\n\nIn the following code snippet, we show the labels required in a kubectl manifest file for the researchers namespace with inference priority. Priority classes will have -priority appended to the name set in the cluster policy. For further guidance on submitting tasks to SageMaker HyperPod task governance, follow the documentation here.\n\nmetadata: name: job-name namespace: hyperpod-ns-researchers labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: hyperpod-ns-researchers-localqueue kueue.x-k8s.io/priority-class: inference-priority\n\nHyperPod CLI\n\nThe HyperPod CLI was created to abstract the complexities of working with kubectl and enable developers using SageMaker HyperPod to iterate faster with custom commands. HyperPod CLI v2.0.0 introduces a new default scheduler type with autofill commands, auto discovery of namespaces, improved cluster and task management features, and enhanced visibility into task priorities and accelerator quota allocations. Data scientists can use the new HyperPod CLI to quickly submit tasks, iterate, and experiment in their generative AI development lifecycle.\n\nSample commands\n\nThe following is a short reference guide for helpful commands when interacting with SageMaker HyperPod task governance:\n\nDescribing cluster policy with the AWS CLI \u2013 This AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command is useful to view the cluster policy settings for your cluster.\n\nList compute quota allocations with the AWS CLI \u2013 This AWS CLI command is useful to view the different teams and set up task governance and their respective quota allocation settings.\n\nHyperPod CLI \u2013 The HyperPod CLI abstracts common kubectl commands used to interact with SageMaker HyperPod clusters such as submitting, listing, and cancelling tasks. Refer to the for a full list of commands.\n\nkubectl \u2013 You can also use kubectl to interact with task governance with the following example commands: kubectl get pytorchjobs -n hyperpod-ns-<team-name> This command shows you the PyTorch tasks running in the specified team namespace. kubectl get workloads -n hyperpod-ns-<team-name> / kubectl describe workload <workload-name> -n hyperpod-ns-<team-name> \u2013 These commands show the workloads running in your cluster per namespace and provide detailed reasonings on Kueue Admission. You can use these commands to answer questions such as \u201cWhy was my task preempted?\u201d or \u201cWhy did my task get admitted?\u201d\n\n\n\nCommon scenarios\n\nSageMaker HyperPod task governance enables allocating compute quota to teams, increasing utilization of compute resources, reducing costs, and accelerating waiting tasks by priority and in turn accelerating time to market. To relate these value propositions to real work scenarios, we will talk about a enterprise and a startup situation.\n\nEnterprises have different teams working towards various business goals, each with budgets that limit their compute access. To maximize resource utilization within budget constraints, SageMaker HyperPod task governance allows enterprises to allocate compute quotas to teams for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tasks. When teams use up their allocation, they can access idle compute from other teams to accelerate waiting tasks, providing optimal resource utilization across the organization.\n\nStartups aim to maximize compute resource utilization while achieving timely allocation for high-priority tasks. SageMaker HyperPod task governance\u2019s prioritization feature allows you to assign priorities to different task types, such as prioritizing inference over training. This makes sure that high-priority tasks receive necessary compute resources before lower-priority ones, optimizing overall resource allocation.\n\nNow we will walk you through two common scenarios for users interacting with SageMaker HyperPod task governance.\n\nScenario 1: Enterprise\n\nIn the first scenario, we have an enterprise company who wants to manage compute allocations to optimize for cost. This company has five teams sharing 80 GPUs, with the following configuration:\n\nTeam 1 \u2013 Compute allocation: 20; Strategy: Don\u2019t Lend\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 20; Strategy: Don\u2019t Lend Team 2 \u2013 Compute allocation: 20; Strategy: Don\u2019t Lend\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 20; Strategy: Don\u2019t Lend Team 3 \u2013 Compute allocation: 5; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 150%; Fair-share weight: 100\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 5; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 150%; Fair-share weight: 100 Team 4 \u2013 Compute allocation: 10; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 100%; Fair-share weight: 75\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 10; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 100%; Fair-share weight: 75 Team 5 \u2013 Compute allocation: 25; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 50%; Fair-share weight: 50\n\nThis sample configuration reserves capacity to teams that will be constantly using instances for high-priority tasks. In addition, a few teams have the option to lend and borrow idle compute from other teams\u2014this improves cost optimization by reserving capacity as needed and allowing non-consistent workloads to run using available idle compute with prioritization.\n\nScenario 2: Startup\n\nIn the second scenario, we have a startup customer who wants to provide equitable compute allocation for members of their engineering and research teams. This company has three teams sharing 15 GPUs:\n\nTeam 1 (ML engineering) \u2013 Compute allocation: 6; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 50%; Fair-share weight: 100\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 6; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 50%; Fair-share weight: 100 Team 2 (Researchers) \u2013 Compute allocation: 5; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 50%; Fair-share weight: 100\n\n\u2013 Compute allocation: 5; Strategy: Lend & Borrow at 50%; Fair-share weight: 100 Team 3 (Real-time chatbot) \u2013 Compute allocation: 4; Strategy: Don\u2019t Lend; Fair-share weight: 100\n\nThis sample configuration promotes equitable compute allocation across the company because all teams have the same fair-share weight and are able to preempt tasks with lower priority.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we discussed best practices for efficient use of SageMaker HyperPod task governance. We also provided certain patterns that you can adopt while administering generative AI tasks, whether you are aiming to optimize for cost or optimize for equitable compute allocation.

            "content": "Amazon may not be the go-to for programmatic ad buys. But with each passing quarter, that assumption is looking shakier.\n\nJust look at its latest earnings: $17.3 billion in ad revenue, a 17% jump from the same period last year. Driving that growth is the Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP), which lets advertisers tap into its rich data to buy ads both within its walled garden and beyond.\n\nWhile that premise isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s been pitched as a full-scale programmatic solution for years. But a steady stream of updates, partnerships and strategic moves has made it more compelling than ever.\n\nTinuiti\u2019s clients are a case in point. Their spending on Prime Video ads has surged over the past year, with Q4 ad spending more than eight times what it was in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhile advertisers don\u2019t have to use Amazon\u2019s DSP for these buys, many do. The share of Prime Video ad spending through the DSP jumped from 26% in the third quarter to 36% in the fourth quarter last year. But the DSP isn\u2019t just becoming the preferred way to buy Prime Video ads \u2013 it\u2019s becoming the dominant way advertisers spend on Amazon, period. By the fourth quarter of 2024, advertisers using the DSP accounted for 32% of all Amazon ad spend.\n\nClients at Pacvue have a similar view. Last year, they posted higher average daily spending on both quarter over quarter (+20.52%) and year over year (+16.63%). While ROAS decreased over the same period, the decline was negligible at -0.42% and effectively balanced out by a 1.63% quarter-over-quarter improvement.\n\nIt\u2019s still early to call how this year will shake out, but so far, the momentum is holding strong.\n\n\u201cI would assume we\u2019ll see similar growth in spending on the Amazon DSP this year compared to last, especially in Europe where we\u2019re seeing interest from advertisers and agencies who are new to the tech,\u201d said Clare Hogan, head of retailer partnerships at Pacvue. \u201cPart of that comes down to the fact that Amazon has removed the barrier of entry to the DSP. If you don\u2019t hit the minimum spend thresholds to be able to use the DSP direct now you can go through a reseller.\u201d\n\nEven smaller advertisers are leaning into the Amazon DSP in a way that\u2019s harder to ignore.\n\nAs Robert Kurtz, group vp of search media solutions at Basis Technologies, explained: \u201cAmazon DSP is a very small percent of where our clients want to allocate ad dollars (high six figures total in spend in all of 2024). However, in just one month of 2025, one client has spent nearly the equivalent of all our Basis 2024 spend on Amazon DSP. So it is already outpacing last year.\u201d\n\nExpect more of these shifts as the year unfolds, particularly from marketers who haven\u2019t traditionally gone all-in on Amazon. The DSP is becoming harder to resist, and for good reason. It\u2019s cheaper than larger DSPs, comes with slimmer tech fees and Amazon is pulling out all the stops to position it as a full-scale programmatic solution \u2013 not just a way to buy ads within its own walls.\n\nWhich is to say, it\u2019s becoming a way to access some of the most valuable real estate outside the largest platforms. And It\u2019s why Amazon is working with programmatic marketplace operators to secure top-tier inventory and why it\u2019s expanding access to premium streaming placements.\n\nThat last move is especially significant for marketers since it means they can now buy more streaming ads across platforms like Disney+, Paramount+ and Max using the same targeting and measurement tools they rely on for Amazon\u2019s own premium TV inventory including Prime Video.\n\n\u201cFor our clients prioritizing OTT/CTV placement, the percentage of spend has remained similar to last year, hovering around 15% of marketing spend, with an overall increase in marketing budget,\u201d said Chris Matheson, media manager at digital ad agency Markacy. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re noticing a shift within that 15%, with more of the spend moving toward Amazon DSP. Last year, it was around 2%-5%, and this year, we\u2019re seeing that increase to 3%-8%.\u201d\n\nBit by bit, Amazon is putting a question in front of its advertisers, especially those already selling on its marketplace. If the DSP can offer a more diversified, data-rich way to buy streaming ads, why go elsewhere?\n\nThe platform\u2019s evolution backs up the pitch. Amazon Publisher Cloud has strengthened its supply-side tech through partnerships with major publishers. Key deals with ad tech firms like Magnite have further expanded its reach. Meanwhile, the supply deal desk has built a steady stream of always-on private marketplace deals, allowing marketers to secure premium inventory and audiences at locked-in prices. The result is a DSP with access to some of the most sought-after TV inventory, all within Amazon\u2019s growing ecosystem.\n\nGreat as the numbers and anecdotes are, the DSP still has a long way to go before its ambitions of becoming the place advertisers go to spend most (if not all) of their digital ad dollars. It still trails its larger rivals, and its growth isn\u2019t necessarily coming at their expense most of the time.\n\nSure, that could change for all the aforementioned reasons but there are still some deeper issues Amazon needs to address, like the ongoing challenge of proving the DSP\u2019s incremental value compared to its more established search ads.\n\n\u201cAmazon DSP for our brands is typically 10-15% of spend once they have maximized sponsored search spend \u2013 typically that holds flat as it\u2019s hard to prove out incrementally often,\u201d said Shray Joshi, founder and CEO of Good Peeps. \u201cThe thing is Amazon gets so much search volume that often you\u2019re better off spending on sponsored search at a lower ROAS on more upper funnel keywords vs. just spending on upper funnel DSP for the sake of it.\u201d\n\nAmazon is well aware of this. It\u2019s part of the reason the company has been working with ad tech firms like TripleLift and YieldMo to address the issue.\n\nJoshi expanded on the point: \u201cWhile the ad tech helps overall brand halo we have found that you can always track the dollar impact on search ads and brands tend to put their money in places where they can directly track ROI.\u201d\n\nIn short, the Amazon DSP remains a crucial gear in an ad machine that\u2019s running more smoothly than ever. Last year, that machine hit a $69 billion annual run rate \u2013 and it\u2019s only accelerating, judging by the enthusiasm from marketers and media buyers. Still, there\u2019s a long road ahead before it becomes the primary DSP for a significant chunk of the ad industry.",

            "content": "I will never understand, dear reader, why we keep running into this baffling issue of Valve (and PC gaming in general) being underestimated. Starting at its roots, when basically no-one thought it'd work as a distribution platform\u2014and extending into the modern age. Ethan Evans, who was the former Vice President of Prime Gaming at Amazon until 2020, took to LinkedIn recently to share his wisdom as to why the giant never toppled Valve. And, uh, basically, they thought they could just throw money at the problem.\n\nAlright, I'm being glib here\u2014and hindsight is 20/20\u2014but reading through this explanation has me saying 'no doy' like it's my new catchphrase. Evans is at least being a little self-reflective, though: \"As VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon, we failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam. We were at least 250x bigger, and we tried everything. But ultimately, Goliath lost.\n\n\"The 15+ year long attempt to challenge Steam started before I was VP of Prime Gaming, but we never cracked the code.\" He then maps out the timeline. First, an ill-fated attempt at making Reflexive Entertainment's online store a thing in 2009: \"It went nowhere.\" Then, an attempt to make a game store after buying Twitch: \"Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch. Wrong.\" Lastly, \"Luna\", a cloud gaming app that I literally hadn't heard of until this point. \"The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google).\" Thorn, meet side.\n\nThat's not to say the assessment that Valve punches above its weight is inaccurate. In fact, back in 2018, some Valve staff tried to figure out just how efficient they were being despite being relatively small. Turns out, their pound-for-pound efficiency was higher than Apple, Facebook, and basically every tech company. Lower profits overall, sure, but per head, Valve was making some absurd bank.\n\nIt's more the naive fascination Evans has with the idea that Steam is good that baffles me. \"The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam. It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well.\" No doy! Oh, look, I've said it again. While the post is couched in the sort of inspirational LinkedIn corporate speech you might expect, Evans really does just seem to state that Amazon has a bit of an ego about, well, damned near everything:\n\n\"At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.\"\n\nOr, in other words, \"just because you are big enough to build something doesn\u2019t mean people will use it.\" In a later comment, Evans writes: \"Steam (Valve) is easy to underestimate.\" Really? Really?\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIt very nearly goes without saying, but since this is an article I should probably say it\u2014this is a fascinating window into the kind of stunning corporate egoism at the very tippy-top of companies like these. It might be accurate to call Amazon a Goliath, but calling Valve a David? Not so much. It's pretty much always been the PC gamer's platform of choice\u2014and I say that as a person who gets uneasy about monopolies, but you can't deny simple facts.\n\nFor reference, The Orange Box, which contained Half-Life 2, Portal, and TF2, arguably some of the heaviest hitters in Valve's arsenal, came out in 2007. Years before Amazon's ill-fated attempt to spin up a store out of Reflexive Entertainment. Who in their right mind would underestimate them in their heyday? Amazon, I guess, which then spent over a decade presumably going 'what do you mean it doesn't work? We have money!'\n\nBut it's not like this kind of underestimation is rare. Sony's CEO recently went and said he has \"high hopes\" the company will be able to coerce PC players not just away from Steam, but from their towers entirely. It's probably an obligatory statement for us here at PC Gamer, but\u2014no, no you aren't going to do that.",

TV9 spoke with Don Fountain, a product defect lawyer, who explained that while the new requirement only took effect this year, the issue began in 2021 when the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) filed a lawsuit against Amazon.\n\nThe lawsuit questioned whether Amazon could be considered a legal product distributor. If so, the law mandates that Amazon ensure product safety, notify customers of defects, and offer refunds for faulty items. Fountain explained that prior to 2021, Amazon took the stance of a mere delivery service, much like the post office.\n\n\u201cBefore 2021, Amazon took the position that they were like the post office. They were a delivery service and they didn\u2019t have an obligation to participate in these types of safety issues,\u201d Fountain said. \u201cAnd that was litigated in individual cases across the country and Amazon had some success in various courts where they said, \u2018No, we\u2019re like FedEx, we\u2019re like the post office.\u201d\n\nNow that Amazon is required to notify consumers about hazardous products, Fountain highlighted the benefits for shoppers.\n\n\u201cRight now, you can go to your Amazon account, or if you want just type into Google, Amazon recall and safety alerts, it will tell you in one click if anything you\u2019ve purchased from Amazon has a recall or safety related issue with it,\u201d Fountain explained.\n\nFountain said this new requirement is a big deal with Amazon being the largest online retailer in the world, and it\u2019s only getting bigger.\n\nFountain explained even before shopping on Amazon, you can go to saferproducts.gov, which takes you directly to the CPSC. There you can look up product defects and recalls, as well as report them.\n\nCopyright 2025 KCRG. All rights reserved.",

Is it really the miracle cure it's hyped up to be? Is it truly like collagen for your hair? With so much love pouring in, it's no surprise that the rosemary oil market is set to soar to a staggering $23.59 billion CAD ($17.53 billion USD) by 2030.\n\nRosemary oil packs a punch of natural goodness without a hefty price tag. If you try products like Amazon's Botanic Hearth's 100% Pure Rosemary Oil, you could be giving your hair care routine the makeover it needs. And right now, as part of Amazon Canada's current deals, the hair oil is on sale for more than 30 per cent off \u2014 which is actually cheaper than it was on Boxing Day 2024. No wonder more than 20,000 people bought it in the past month.\n\nScroll down to see what all the buzz is about.\n\nThe details\n\nIf you're on the lookout for a rosemary oil that can rescue you from thinning hair and provide scalp nourishment, Botanic Hearth\u2019s product is worth checking out. Botanic Hearth claims that its product is made with pure extract and also includes biotin, jojoba oil and castor oil. It comes with an applicator comb, making it easy to apply directly to your scalp.\n\nWhat the reviewers are saying\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f 4.2/5 stars\n\n\ud83d\udcac 11,500+ ratings\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 \"Works like magic\"\n\nThe original, full-size bottle has earned more than 11,500 reviews on Amazon and a 4.2-star rating. One person notes \u201cinsane growth after a month,\u201d and another says they saw a noticeable difference within three weeks \u2014 it works \u201clike magic,\u201d they write.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a \"natural, affordable solution to support hair growth\" and \"improve scalp health,\" then \"I highly recommend trying rosemary oil,\" says another reviewer. With regular use, \"it can make a noticeable difference.\"\n\n\"This actually worked!\" writes a third shopper. \"My bald spot is growing in nicely,\" they say. \"I\u2019m so thankful!\"\n\nSeveral users appreciate the product\u2019s quality, mentioning how it leaves hair \u201csilky and soft,\u201d but they are disappointed about the lack of visible results. Some reviewers cite a \u201cgreasy look\u201d and its ineffectiveness against dandruff, with one person stating it \u201cmakes hair stiff and scalp greasy.\u201d\n\nIs rosemary oil good for your hair?\n\nCaroline Ruggiero, a certified trichologist with the International Association of Trichologists (I.A.T), tells Yahoo Canada that rosemary oil could just be your new best friend, primarily because of its ability to promote \u201cmicrocirculation and vasodilation,\u201d both of which have been linked to hair growth. \u201cRosemary has anti-fungal properties and stimulating properties. In many cases, rosemary is used in combination with other oils and ingredients to aid in scalp problems,\u201d she says.\n\nIn cases of natural hair thinning, rosemary oil has shown favourable results. However, Ruggiero, the CEO of Truly You Hair and Scalp Clinic, says that for certain disorders, such as androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness), which is autoimmune, \u201cessential oil cannot grow hair back.\u201d She adds, \u201cTreating most hair loss disorders is like treating aging \u2014 there is no cure. But just because there is no cure does not mean there is no care.\u201d\n\nDoes rosemary oil help hair growth or thicken the hair?\n\nA 2023 study on mice corroborates that rosemary helps promote hair growth. Additionally, Ruggiero recommends combining rosemary oil with other essential oils to enhance its benefits. For strengthening hair, she suggests \u201cBay St. Thomas (Pimenta racemosa) and grapefruit oils,\u201d while for revitalizing the scalp, \u201crosewood and geranium oils are ideal.\u201d\n\nTo improve scalp health and tackle dandruff, Ruggiero advises mixing rosemary oil with palmarosa, cade and laurel oils. \u201cFor a shampoo boost, try adding eight drops of rosemary oil, six of juniper, three of chamomile and eight of lavender. \u201cThis blend can be helpful in treating dandruff,\u201d she says.\n\nIs rosemary oil safe to use on beards?\n\nThanks to its antimicrobial, antifungal and rubefacient properties, rosemary oil is safe to use on beards. \u201cThese properties could provide potential benefits for beard care,\u201d Ruggiero adds. While rosemary essential oil isn\u2019t typically irritating, she emphasizes that it should always be diluted and used for short periods, especially if you have sensitive or damaged skin.\n\n\u201cIn high doses, when used internally, it can be toxic,\u201d she warns. Ruggiero also says that folks with epilepsy best avoid rosemary oil. \u201cCamphor is a constituent in rosemary and can cause convulsions,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe verdict\n\nFor those dedicated to their hair care routine, the Botanic Hearth Rosemary Hair Oil could be a good addition, especially considering its sale price. Studies have shown that consistent and long-term use of rosemary oil has supported hair growth and thickening. However, it\u2019s important to set realistic expectations. \u201cHair loss can be challenging, and it\u2019s important to seek professional, evidence-based support to address it effectively,\" Ruggiero advises.\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nLet us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

            "content": "Do people trust Temu or Amazon? What shoppers are choosing amid Trump tariffs.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Supply chain analyst says e-commerce may be worst hit by US tariffs \u201cWhen you look at the executive order that the Trump administration did, it revoked the \u2018de minimis\u2019 allowance for e-commerce goods into the U.S., such as Temu and SHEIN. So the biggest hit will be those players, as well as Amazon.\"\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated how much lower Amazon's prices are on average according to an independent study. The figure is 14%.\n\nConsumers shopping on Amazon and low-cost retailer Temu are often comparing goods between the two online sellers, but price seems to win out, a new study and survey has found.\n\nWhile only 5% of survey respondents said they trusted Temu, 53% of the consumers still said they shopped at the China-based retailer in the last year, the survey and study by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing platform company, said. USA TODAY was given an exclusive first look at the research.\n\nBy comparison, 87% of respondents said they trusted Amazon, with 75% saying they shopped on the platform in the last year and 18% saying they shopped there more than once a week.\n\nThe study found that consumers could save 40% more (or $13.37 per product) by shopping at Temu rather than Amazon, but that new U.S. tariffs and potential price increases will affect consumers' behavior.\n\nConsumers worried about tariff pricing increases\n\nWhile consumers said they were expecting prices to go up based on tariffs imposed on foreign goods by the U.S., a surprising number, or 20% of survey respondents said they would continue shopping at Chinese marketplaces like Temu if prices increased, said Greg Zakowicz Sr., e-commerce expert at Omnisend. Twenty-nine percent said they'd immediately stop buying or buy less, and 20% said they'd stop if the increase is noticeable.\n\nAbout 40% of survey respondents also said they'd be willing to pay more for U.S.-made goods. That surprised Zakowicz.\n\nZakowicz said his company has been following consumer behavior \"and consumers are very much value-minded,\" he said, adding it's hard to believe that consumers would suddenly be willing to pay more.\n\nHe believes there's a dichotomy between what consumers say they're going to do and ultimately how they actually react.\n\nConsumers are willing to 'trade down' for price\n\nZakowicz said the survey did not specifically ask respondents about their feelings about product quality, but did ask about how much they trusted products.\n\nCustomers may say they lack trust in Temu products, but they seem willing to \"trade down\" because the price is so low, he said.\n\nTariffs and you: How will Trump's tariffs hit your wallet? What to expect on everyday price tags.\n\nThe survey also showed that 77% of Amazon products have a similar counterpart on Temu, with every 10th item being identical. But many Temu products appear to be knockoffs with manipulated reviews. During a two-month review of both sites, Omnisend researchers \"observed disappearing reviews and instances of poorly reviewed products being removed and reuploaded, suggesting potential review manipulation.\"\n\nThe survey also said that 24% of Americans have shopped on Amazon Haul, the retailer's niche site for lower-cost products that take longer to ship from China.\n\nTemu, Amazon respond to survey, study\n\nIn a statement responding to the survey and study, Temu said \"the survey results confirm what millions of shoppers already know \u2012 Temu offers substantial savings on the same or similar products sold elsewhere by cutting out unnecessary middlemen markups and costs.\"\n\nThe retailer also said \"as a young platform that\u2019s just two years old, we know trust is built over time. The number of new and returning customers reflects the value they find in our platform. We\u2019ll continue working to improve every part of the experience.\"\n\nTemu said it did not allow counterfeit products on its platform and \"all reviews come from verified Temu verified purchases.\"\n\nTemu also said it does not take down product listings because they have negative reviews, or delete critical reviews.\n\n\"Reviews do not factor into deactivation of a product listing. Negative reviews are retained as long as they align with our Review and Community Guidelines. Even in cases where a product listing is temporarily deactivated and later relisted, all reviews remain visible and unchanged,\" Temu said.\n\nAlso in a written statement, an Amazon spokesperson responded specifically to the survey claim that 77% of Amazon products have a similar product on Temu, with every 10th being identical.\n\n\"Amazon works hard every day to offer low prices in our store across our wide selection of products. We asked to see specific and pertinent details required to investigate the claims and were denied the opportunity to do so. We believe this report may be misleading and inaccurate because often studies compare similar but not identical items (i.e., different brands, product sizes, product assortments),\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon also said an independent study from Profitero found Amazon's online prices to be the lowest among all major U.S. retailers for eight years in a row, with prices that were an average of 14% less than competitors' in 2024.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

            "content": "Securing your business email is more critical than ever in today\u2019s digital workplace. To help you protect your users and data in Amazon WorkMail, we have introduced enhanced security features that give organizations more control and protection for their communication platforms. With the integration of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center, WorkMail now offers robust multi-factor authentication and personal access token capabilities that can help prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and protect sensitive business communications. In this post, we\u2019ll explore how these new security features can strengthen your organization\u2019s email security strategy\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmail remains a critical business communication channel, yet it\u2019s also one of the most targeted by cybercriminals. When you\u2019re managing an organization\u2019s communications, a single compromised account can lead to significant financial losses, damage your reputation, and serve as a gateway for additional cyber attacks. Traditional username and password protection is no longer adequate against growing cyber threats.\n\nWith Amazon WorkMail, you now have powerful tools to enhance your email security. Our support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Personal Access Token (PAT) capabilities provides administrators with essential additional security layers to prevent unauthorized account access.\n\nThis blog demonstrates WorkMail\u2019s integration with the IAM Identity Center\u2019s default identity store to enable these advanced security features. If you\u2019re using third-party identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID or Okta Universal Directory, you\u2019ll find dedicated integration guides in our documentation.\n\nHigh-level Overview\n\nAmazon WorkMail\u2019s default authentication is established via a unique username & password:\n\nUsers of the WorkMail web-app sign in using their username and password. Users who access WorkMail from a desktop &/or mobile email application sign in using their username and password.\n\nAfter you integrate WorkMail with IAM Identity Center, Amazon WorkMail can be configured with enhanced authentication that requires:\n\nUsers of the WorkMail web-app will log-in via their unique AWS Access Portal using username, password and a MFA token. Upon successful log-in, they select and are redirected into the WorkMail web-app. Users who access WorkMail from a desktop &/or mobile email app continue to sign in to WorkMail using their username, however they must use a personal access token (PAT) instead of their WorkMail password.\n\nMore details about WorkMail authentication can be found in our documentation.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAdministrator access to an AWS account You can evaluate the integration in this post for a limited period of time using an AWS Free Tier Account (link = https://aws.amazon.com/free ) Administrator access to an Amazon WorkMail Organization Your WorkMail organization should have at least 3 or more users for testing Administrator access to Amazon IAM Identity Center Your WorkMail and IAM Identity Center must be in the same AWS region\n\nHigh-level Configuration Steps\n\nConfigure Identity Center (see our documentation for detailed information). Configure WorkMail to use Identity Center (see our documentation for detailed information). Assign IAM Identity Center users/groups to WorkMail organization Associate Amazon WorkMail users with IAM Identity Center users (this step is not necessary if your IdC and WorkMail user names are exactly the same, see our documentation for details) Check Authentication mode (see documentation) & Personal access token configuration (see documentation). Allow both WorkMail Directory (no MFA/PAT) and Identity Center (requires MFA & PAT) modes for testing. Test your users\u2019 access to WorkMail with MFA & PAT Notify your WorkMail users of upcoming changes to login procedures. Switch WorkMail Authentication Mode to Identity Center only. When your users are ready for MFA and PAT, switch authentication mode to require MFA and desktop and mobile email clients to use PAT. Review additional WorkMail security guidance in AWS blogs and documentation to ensure you are up to date with the latest security guidance.\n\nDetailed Configuration Guidance\n\nConfigure AWS IAM Identity Center\n\nOpen the IdC console in the same AWS region as your WorkMail organization. If this is your first time accessing IAM Identity Center, you\u2019ll be greeted with the IdC console home page and \u201cEnable IAM Identity Center\u201d. Click the **`Enable`** button. Unless you have a reason to use an account instance of IdC, choose Enable. In a new browser window, open the WorkMail console in the same AWS region as the IdC you created above. Arrange the IdC console browser next to the WorkMail console browser window so you can easily copy/paste between the two services. In the IdC console\u2019s left navigation rail, choose users and click add user. Create several IdC user accounts with the same usernames and email addresses as your WorkMail users. Using identical usernames in Amazon WorkMail and IAM Identity Center simplifies user synchronization and reduces authentication errors during integration. This alignment streamlines troubleshooting and user lifecycle management while ensuring consistent access control across both services.) Make sure the \u201cSend an email to this user with password setup instructions.\u201d is selected. The user will receive an email with a link to set up a password and instructions to connect to the AWS access portal. The link will be valid for up to 7 days. You can grant this user permissions to accounts or applications (such as WorkMail) when they sign in to the AWS access portal. In IdC\u2019s left navigation rail, choose groups and create a new group called \u201c workmail_users \u201d. Add the IdC users created above to the IdC workmail_users group. Configure WorkMail to use Identity Center In the WorkMail console\u2019s left navigation rail, click the link for Identity Center. Click the down arrow for Multi-factor authentication setup guide Click Step 1 \u2013 Enable identity center and click Enable. Assign IAM Identity Center users/groups to WorkMail organization Click the down arrow for Multi-factor authentication setup guide Click Step 2 \u2013 Add and Assign users and click Next Assigning users and groups \u2013 Users and groups synced to your Identity Center directory are available to assign to your application. Learn more Click Get Started Type workmail_users and select it from the drop-down list. Click Assign You will get a message \u201cSuccessfully assigned group workmail_users. Please continue with step 3 by associating users within this group with WorkMail users.\u201d Authentication mode & Personal access token configuration The default Authentication mode is set to WorkMail directory and Identity center. Don\u2019t change this yet. This will allow WorkMail web-app users to continue to login to the WorkMail client directly, without MFA. The Personal access token configuration default is set to active, and token lifespan set to 365 days. PATs are used by desktop and mobile email clients to login to WorkMail. This will allow desktop and mobile email clients to continue to login to the WorkMail with their username and password, without a PAT. Test WorkMail logins to verify a few users can properly access their WorkMail accounts via both the WorkMail web-app and your organization\u2019s unique AWS access portal URL. Open the Amazon WorkMail web application and login as one of your test users. You should have an email invitation to join AWS IAM Identity Center. Accept the invitation. Create a IdC password. Use your username and the new password to login to IdC. Register an MFA device Click Next You\u2019ll be redirected to the AWS access portal. Enter your user name and password Provide your MFA token Click the tile for Amazon WorkMail to login to the WorkMail web-app Desktop or mobile email software users need to create PATs to access WorkMail (once the WorkMail administrator disables the WorkMail directory Authentication mode and logins are via the Identity center AWS access portal URL only). Note \u2013 PATs are retrieved by individual users from within the WorkMail web-client after logging in via the AWS access portal URL (with MFA). Open the AWS access portal URL and login You can find the URL from the Identity Center console > Settings > AWS access portal URL Login via your username password Register an MFA device You\u2019ll be redirected to the AWS access portal. Enter your user name and password Provide your MFA token Click the tile for Amazon WorkMail to login to the WorkMail web-app In the web-app, click the settings (gear in top right) icon In settings, click Personal access token and Create token Enter a token name (typically the device on which you\u2019ll use this PAT) and select create token. Copy the token value (this is the only time you can retrieve this token value). Open your desktop or mobile email software, enter your username and your PAT (the PAT replaces your existing user password). Notify your WorkMail users of upcoming changes to login procedures Once you have tested the integration between Amazon WorkMail and IAM Identity Center with a few test users, you should prepare your WorkMail users for the increased login security. For example, you could send them an email that explains: The organization is adding an additional login security step to help protect their inboxes. Inform them that they should anticipate an email from the AWS IAM Identity Center with info about the upcoming implementation of MFA for web-app users and PATs for desktop and mobile client users. Users should accept the invitation and create a new password for the AWS IAM Identity Center. Inform them that once WorkMail MFA is enabled, all WorkMail web-app users will be required to use their username, password and MFA. Inform them that once WorkMail PATs are enabled, all WorkMail desktop and mobile email client users will need to login to the WorkMail web client (with MFA) via the AWS access portal URL, create one PAT per software client (the same PAT can not be used on desktop and mobile). They then must update their desktop or mobile email software to use their username and PAT, instead of their current password. Explain that the PAT is now their email client application password and their personal desktop or mobile email software passwords will no longer work. Provide users with a way to request support. Switch WorkMail Authentication Mode to Identity Center only Once you are satisfied that your WorkMail users have incorporated MFA and/or PATs into their WorkMail login routines, the WorkMail administrator should disable the WorkMail directory Authentication mode found in the WorkMail console under Organization > Identity Center.

However, Prime members can enjoy more perks, such as free and fast shipping and delivery, exclusive deals, and access to Prime Video, so the subscription may be worth it.\n\nIf you're interested, you can learn more about pricing and perks in our guide to Amazon Prime benefits.\n\nAre Amazon's Presidents Day deals worth it?\n\nYes, Presidents Day is a great time to shop. During the long weekend, Amazon runs some of the lowest markdowns we see all year on items that are rarely on sale, like the Peloton Original Bike and Dyson Airwrap.\n\nOnce the Presidents Day sale wraps up, it's unlikely we'll see deals this good again until the spring and summer when Memorial Day and Amazon Prime Day come back around.",

            "content": "Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers are doubling down on their AI infrastructure spending this year.\n\nThe stock market appears to be in the middle of quite the storm as of late. In the final days of January, a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek sent shock waves around the world after it released an artificial intelligence (AI) model similar to ChatGPT -- and claims to have trained its AI with legacy architectures that aren't widely leveraged by U.S. developers.\n\nWhile technology stocks in general have been more volatile since DeepSeek's arrival, none has taken a hit as hard as Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%). Investors are panicking that Nvidia's newer chipware may not be as much of a necessity, given DeepSeek's claims.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's future prospects is disorienting, some of the company's biggest partners have been dropping clues as to how DeepSeek is influencing their own AI roadmaps. I'll analyze what these trends are and assess how they might impact Nvidia.\n\nExamining big tech's AI infrastructure plans\n\nNvidia makes its fortune primarily through its compute and networking business, which sells advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are integral for generative AI applications, and are primarily housed in large data centers.\n\nWhile DeepSeek claims to have built its AI using Nvidia's old H800 GPUs, it's been difficult to verify how accurate that is. Nevertheless, all of Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers have reported earnings for the full calendar year 2024, and there is a common thread stitching their broader AI fabric together.\n\nMicrosoft kicked things off by announcing the company will be spending $80 billion this year on data centers and other AI infrastructure projects. Meta Platforms followed up with its own aggressive spending plans -- hinting that the company could see capital expenditures (capex) up to $65 billion this year. Lastly, Alphabet and Amazon are projected to spend an estimated $180 billion combined on AI capex this year.\n\nOn the surface, big tech's rising capex plans this year should be seen as a positive thing for Nvidia. However, when Nvidia reports earnings on Feb. 26, there is one thing in particular I think investors need to be laser-focused on.\n\nWhat should investors be looking for when Nvidia reports earnings?\n\nInvestors should listen carefully to management's commentary as it relates to the spending from big tech I outlined. While Nvidia isn't going to capture all of this spend, investors should still be able to get a glimpse into how much capex the Magnificent Seven will be allocating toward Nvidia.\n\nIn my eyes, the best way to figure this out is to look at Nvidia's financial guidance. If the company's growth rates are accelerating, I'd say this is a good proxy that big tech will be spending heavily on Nvidia's newest chip architectures this year. But on the flip side, if Nvidia's guidance calls for a material deceleration in growth, it could be that its biggest customers are still buying from Nvidia, but doing so in a more protracted way.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy before Feb. 26?\n\nIt's rare that I encourage timing an investment. As long-term investors, buying stock on a specific day isn't the most important factor. Rather, it's more important to reassess your conviction in your holdings, and so long as you remain optimistic, using a strategy of dollar-cost averaging over the course of many years is generally a recipe for success.\n\nThis is a rare occasion where I think buying the dip in Nvidia prior to earnings could be a good formula.\n\nConsidering history suggests that Nvidia stock will indeed rise following its fourth-quarter earnings, combined with big tech's capex plans just for this year, and the share price recovery from the DeepSeek sell-off pictured, I'm cautiously optimistic that Nvidia stock is a lucrative opportunity right now.",

At the time of writing, Amazon sells the unit in that particular coating for $70 off. The timepiece offers multiple advanced features and is a tempting pick at its current price. Buy at Amazon\n\nReceive the latest phone deals Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nAfter a couple of months of absence, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 is on sale once again! The unit is now available for $70 off its original price at Amazon. That lets you buy it for about $230 instead of nearly $300.While this is a decent discount indeed, the affordable Garmin watch has been cheaper in the past. Most notably, Black Friday 2024 saw it drop under the $200 mark, saving you $100. Another thing to note is that only the Navy unit is on sale at that price (at least for now).Like most Garmin watches , the Vivoactive 5 offers more battery life than the most smartwatches on the market. While testing it (see our Garmin Vivoactive 5 review for reference), we noted you can get about four days of use per charge on average (with always-on display). Once you turn off the special feature, you can get up to 11 days of use, which is great news for sure.Aside from the long battery life, this lightweight timepiece features an OLED touchscreen, which is a joy to look at. What about its wellness and health-tracking capabilities? Well, as a Vivoactive and not a Forerunner model, it lacks ultra-detailed running stats. It certainly won't prepare you for a marathon, too. Still, unless you're a hardcore runner, you'll hardly miss those stats.On the workout-tracking front, the Vivoactive 5 has over 30 built-in sports apps, letting you track various activities, get VO2 Max readings and more. There are even workout creation features on deck, as well as Garmin Coach.You also get heart rate measurements, HRV status, stress and sleep tracking, among others. As you can see, this buddy has almost all the features you can expect in many of the best smartwatches . Then again, its proprietary operating system is a tad more challenging to get used to. If you've been wearing Wear OS smartwatches so far, you might need some time to get adjusted.Despite its somewhat tedious operating system, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 is a fantastic pick at its current asking price. If you need a wearable with an OLED touchscreen, long battery life and accurate metrics, go ahead and grab this one for $70 off at Amazon.",

Also freed were 46-year-old Iair Horn and 36-year-old Sagui Dekel Chen.\n\nThe three men were freed as part of a deal which involved Israel releasing 369 Palestinian prisoners, marking the sixth exchange under a ceasefire deal between the Jewish state and Hamas.\n\nJassy said in the message Troufanov, along with his mother, grandmother and girlfriend, was abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas.

A successful unionization vote would have been historic, as RDU1 would have become only the second Amazon facility to organize in the nation and the first in the South.\n\n\u201cThe election results today are a result of Amazon\u2019s willingness to break the law and use its enormous wealth to try and break our movement,\u201d CAUSE leadership wrote in a statement following the vote. \u201c\u2026 We will continue organizing: This is only the beginning, and we are building momentum in this struggle against exploitation.\u201d\n\nOrin Starn, professor of cultural anthropology and history who worked undercover in the warehouse and supported the unionization effort, noted that \u201cit wasn\u2019t unexpected for us to lose, but we hoped that we would win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\u201d wrote Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards in a Sunday email to The Chronicle.\n\nUnion busting allegations\n\nCAUSE filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board Feb. 12, accusing Amazon of allegedly firing employees \u201cin retaliation for their union activity,\u201d which would violate federal labor law.\n\nIn the Sunday email, Hards noted that she could not comment broadly on employee terminations without individual case details. However, she mentioned that two former Amazon employees who have recently been vocal about their termination were not fired because of their involvement in the unionization effort but instead due to violations of the company\u2019s policies on drugs and alcohol and on misconduct involving the use of derogatory language in the workplace. According to Starn, Amazon representatives removed pro-union posters, fired employees who were found attempting to convince other staff to vote to unionize and erected a half-mile fence around the facility to keep out union representatives during the lead-up to the election. Hards wrote in the Sunday email that the company\u2019s decision to construct a fence around the RDU1 facility was made in response to \u201cseveral incidents where individuals have trespassed and refused to leave [Amazon\u2019s] property\u201d in recent weeks, prompting the company to invest in \u201cadditional security measures.\u201d The company also reportedly hosted \u201ctown halls\u201d to convince workers of the disadvantages of unionizing and flew in area and operations managers to run the anti-union campaign. In the Sunday email, Hards stressed that the town halls were \u201cvoluntary,\u201d which she wrote was \u201ccommunicate[d] to employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe believe that both decisions should be equally protected, which is why we talk openly, candidly and respectfully about these topics, actively sharing facts with employees so they can use that information to make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nLiterature reportedly distributed by Amazon and obtained by The Chronicle included messaging that \u201cunions run their businesses with your money\u201d and that none of the benefits CAUSE advocated for would be guaranteed in negotiations. The documents also included a charge that CAUSE would \u201ctrad[e] something important to you for something they want, like deducting dues from your paycheck,\u201d in reference to benefits such as schedule flexibility.\n\nThe vote was held in the warehouse itself, where Amazon had allegedly posted materials encouraging employees to vote against unionizing.\n\nStarn added that Amazon \u201cproduce[d] these very slick anti-union videos\u201d in contrast to CAUSE, which Starn claims operates on a \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d budget.\n\nHards noted in her email that \u201cCAUSE has never negotiated a union contract anywhere and has no experience representing workers or their interests.\u201d\n\nCAUSE to continue efforts despite setback\n\nCAUSE\u2019s demands included a $30 hourly minimum wage, 180 hours of paid leave each year, a fully paid one-hour break during shifts, accommodations for injured and disabled employees, increased paid vacation time and equal treatment for all workers.\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Sign up for our weekly newsletter. Cancel at any time. Email Address\n\nHards wrote that the facility\u2019s current pay range is $18.50 to $23.80 but noted that \u201cpay is not capped\u201d and that \u201cAmazon increases hourly wages every year.\u201d She added that Amazon invested in its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d $2.2 billion wage increases in 2024 and that RDU1 boasts a \u201cstrong safety record that\u2019s far better than industry average.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina currently has the lowest percentage of unionized workers nationwide at 2.4% \u2014 less than a quarter of the national average. The state also has a right-to-work law on the books, meaning workers cannot be compelled to join a union as a condition of employment.\n\n\u201cWe've had, in the last month, workers at facilities across the Carolinas come to us and ask us to help them with organizing union movements in their facilities,\u201d Starn said. \u201cSo we're ready to move forward with this.\u201d\n\nAccording to Starn, union leaders are due to meet with their legal team to discuss possibly taking additional legal action against Amazon for alleged illegal practices during the voting process.\n\n\u201cThis is also, in its own way, a fight for justice and for all people to have a chance to make a living and to live the American dream,\u201d Starn said. \u201cThere's going to be victories and there's going to be defeats along the way.\u201d",

After that, \u201cThe Chosen\u201d Season 5 will now exclusively premiere on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video in the U.S. this June. (\u201cThe Chosen\u201d will also be available, on a non-exclusive basis, on Prime Video in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sub-Saharan Africa, UK, and Latin America later this year.)\n\nUnder the deal, Prime Video will also take over exclusive U.S. streaming rights to the first five seasons of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d as well as future seasons of \u201cThe Chosen.\u201d \u201cThe Chosen\u201d was previously available on multiple platforms, including Netflix, Hulu and Peacock \u2014 but those deals have all expired in recent months. The show has also been run linearly in primetime on The CW, but it\u2019s unclear whether Season 5 of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d will still get a broadcast run.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAdditionally, Amazon MGM Studios will also now hold theatrical distribution rights to the next two installments of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d focused on the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, which will make up Seasons 6 and 7 (the final two seasons) of the series. Currently, Season 5 is set to be distributed in the U.S. next month by Fathom and internationally by Trafalgar Releasing.\n\nThis continues the unique distribution model that \u201cThe Chosen\u201d has done since its launch as a crowdfunded indie short in 2017 \u2014 including \u201cThe Chosen\u201d app, theatrical, linear outlets and streaming. \u201cThe Chosen\u201d has found success in recent years by premiering in theaters first before moving to other windows.\n\n5&2 Studios founder Dallas Jenkins had been looking at possibly bringing on an exclusive distribution partner for \u201cThe Chosen\u201d ever since he was able to take over full ownership of the series. Last year, an arbitrator ended the relationship between Jenkins\u2019 The Chosen LLC and former partner Angel Studios, giving Jenkins oversight of \u201cThe Chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor several years, the team at Amazon MGM Studios has proved over and over they\u2019re passionate about this show and our fans,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make us better and get the show to more people, and I can\u2019t wait to build this relationship.\u201d\n\nJenkins launched 5&2 Studios in September, after the arbitration ruling gave him control of \u201cThe Chosen.\u201d At the time, he exclusively revealed to Variety his plans to expand \u201cThe Chosen\u201d universe with several new projects, including \u201cThe Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls.\u201d Other projects in the works include \u201cThe Chosen Adventures,\u201d a youthful take on the Jesus story, featuring voice actors including Paul Walter Hauser (\u201cBlack Bird\u201d) and Yvonne Orji (\u201cInsecure\u201d). And after \u201cThe Chosen\u201d wraps, for his next flagship program, Jenkins plans to next write, direct and showrun a three-season series about the life of Moses.\n\nThe deal with Amazon MGM Studios has so far only mentioned \u201cThe Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,\u201d and made no mention of \u201cThe Chosen Adventures\u201d or future projects. But as part of the deal, Amazon MGM Studios signed a first-look series and film deal with 5&2 Studios.\n\n\u201c\u2019The Chosen\u2019 has had renowned success captivating audiences across generations, and we are looking forward to collaborating with Dallas and 5&2 Studios on a larger scale,\u201d said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cAs we look ahead, we see massive opportunities to develop additional faith-inspired content for our global Prime Video customers.\u201d\n\nSanders joined Jenkins, the chairman/CEO of 5&2 Studios and creator/exec producer of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d and \u201cThe Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,\u201d on the livestream. Also in attendance was Amazon MGM Studios development exec Traci Blackwell.\n\nLionsgate, which handles global distribution for \u201cThe Chosen\u201d and \u201cThe Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,\u201d negotiated the deal for 5&2 Studios with Amazon MGM Studios, while CAA \u2014 which reps 5&2 Studios \u2014 handled the first-look component.\n\nInsiders noted that Lionsgate has found success in striking third-party deals, including one it did for the hit series \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d with Hulu. This one was even more elaborate given the mix of a theatrical window in addition to scripted and unscripted franchises.\n\n\u201cAmazon MGM Studios is the perfect partner to take this already highly sought-after property to the next level,\u201d said Lionsgate\u2019s Jim Packer, president of worldwide television distribution. \u201cThis wide-ranging, multi-territory deal presents a unique opportunity to deepen engagement with \u2018The Chosen\u2019s\u2019 loyal fanbase while drawing in new viewers around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chosen\u201d Season 5 has been dubbed \u201cThe Chosen: Last Supper.\u201d Here\u2019s the logline: \u201cThe table is set. The people of Israel welcome Jesus as king while his disciples anticipate his crowning. But\u2014instead of confronting Rome\u2014he turns the tables on the Jewish religious festival. Their power threatened, the country\u2019s religious and political leaders will go to any length to ensure this Passover meal is Jesus\u2019 last.\u201d\n\nAs for the six-episode \u201cThe Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,\u201d the host \u201ctakes the cast of The Chosen, as well as director Dallas Jenkins, on their own adventures into the wilderness. Bear Grylls will find out exactly what makes his guests tick, explore their personal journeys, and push them to their ultimate limits,\u201d per the logline.\n\nBesides CAA, 5&2 Studios is also repped by Andrew Kramer of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, LLP.",

There were 77 challenged ballots, a gap that\u2019s too narrow to change the outcome of the election. The results still need to be certified by the NLRB.\n\nThe election at the facility, named RDU1 and located in the suburb of Garner, came after organizers with the upstart Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment (CAUSE) campaigned at the warehouse for the past three years. The facility employs roughly 4,700 workers.\n\nCAUSE said in a statement that the election results were a \u201cresult of Amazon\u2019s willingness to break the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s relentless and illegal efforts to intimidate us prove that this company is afraid of workers coming together to claim our power,\u201d the group said. \u201cAmazon may think it is above the law, but we will not accept a system that allows billionaires and corporations to play by a different set of rules.\u201d\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards denied that the company broke the law or interfered with the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\u201d Hards said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to make this a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.\u201d\n\nAmazon, the nation\u2019s second-largest private employer, has long sought to keep unions out of its ranks. The strategy succeeded in the U.S. until 2022, when workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted to join the Amazon Labor Union. Last month, workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia voted to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union.\n\nAmazon responded to the Garner union drive with a barrage of anti-union messages in the warehouse, on a website, and sent through its AtoZ app to employees. A leader of the warehouse urged employees to \u201cvote no,\u201d saying a union \u201ccan get in the way of how we work together.\u201d The company described CAUSE as an \u201coutside party\u201d that\u2019s \u201cclaiming to be a union.\u201d\n\nAmazon has previously said its employees can choose whether or not to join a union, and that it speaks \u201copenly, candidly and respectfully about these topics\u201d so that they can \u201cmake an informed decision.\u201d\n\nCAUSE was founded in 2022 by RDU1 employees Mary Hill and Rev. Ryan Brown to voice concerns about the company\u2019s response to the Covid pandemic, which they viewed as inadequate. The group sought to organize RDU1 to boost wages and secure longer breaks.\n\nStarting pay at RDU1 is $18.50 an hour. CAUSE has pushed to negotiate for wages of $30 an hour.\n\nIn its statement on Saturday, CAUSE said it intended to continue organizing at RDU1 \u201cbecause over half of Amazon employees are still struggling with food and housing insecurity.\u201d\n\nLabor groups have looked beyond NLRB elections in an attempt to gain a union foothold at Amazon. They\u2019ve assisted employees with filing unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against Amazon, accusing the company of violating labor laws.\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters helped coordinate a picket effort at nine Amazon facilities in December. Amazon said the walkout had no impact on its operations.\n\nThe Teamsters union has said it represents 9,000 Amazon workers around the country, although the company has refused to recognize the union and bargain with leadership.\n\nUnions have enjoyed increasing support across the country, with 67% of Americans saying they approve of labor unions, according to Gallup. But that hasn\u2019t translated into higher membership rates. Union membership in the private sector declined slightly to 5.9% in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNorth Carolina had the lowest union membership rate in the country last year, with only 2.4% of workers in the state represented, according to the BLS.",

            "content": "Amazon is poised for massive expansion of its data center operations in eastern Oregon on 400 acres the company is buying in the tiny Columbia River city of Arlington.\n\nThe Seattle-based company already has several enormous data centers in neighboring Morrow and Umatilla counties. Amazon said it could be many years before it\u2019s operating in Arlington as it pursues permits, electricity and tax breaks for the site, but the company and community are planning for the major changes that will accompany the project.\n\nData centers have grown rapidly into one of Oregon\u2019s largest industries over the past several years. The huge installations are having a profound impact in small cities and counties across Oregon, even as they strain the state\u2019s energy supply and electrical grid.\n\nFor Gilliam County, which has just about 2,000 residents spread over more than 1,200 square miles, Amazon\u2019s arrival represents the city\u2019s biggest economic opportunity in decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an enhanced growth spurt for us and we\u2019re actually quite excited about it,\u201d said Arlington Mayor Jeffery Bufton. \u201cWe won\u2019t end up being just a truck stop on the highway.\u201d\n\nArlington sits about 140 miles east of Portland, along Interstate 84 and the Columbia River. Much of the original city was flooded in the 1960s when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the John Day Dam, raising the river level. The new town, on higher ground, is nestled against hills abutting the Columbia.\n\nGilliam County is wheat country and, more recently, it\u2019s also home to some of the state\u2019s largest wind and solar projects. Arlington is the destination for most of the garbage produced by people living in Portland and Seattle. The trash comes by truck or by train to a garbage dump south of town.\n\nAmazon paid $10 million last summer for 376 acres on a mesa above the city and is in the process of buying another 30 acres from the Port of Arlington for $3 million. The city and port began readying the properties for development a dozen years ago, hoping it would eventually attract new industry to the region.\n\nThe site makes sense for Amazon\u2019s expansion because of its proximity to the company\u2019s other Oregon data centers, according to Kevin Miller, the company\u2019s vice president of data centers in Seattle.\n\nMany of Amazon\u2019s corporate clients run complex software applications that draw from many databases and servers. Even light takes time to travel from place to place, so Miller said Amazon\u2019s clients need their data to be stored in data centers that are close to one another geographically so that information can move among various computers almost instantaneously.\n\n\u201cWe all think light is very, very fast,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut when you start to do the math, actually, the milliseconds start to add up the farther away the data centers are.\u201d\n\nAmazon plans 13 years ahead when deciding where it will build its next data centers, according to Miller. He said a land purchase like the recent one in Arlington is the first step in a process that takes \u201cmany years,\u201d though Miller declined to speculate on just when it might start building there.\n\nBut he did say that Amazon expects its footprint in Arlington could be as large as its big operations in Morrow and Umatilla counties.\n\n\u201cFor the size of parcel that we\u2019re getting in Arlington,\u201d Miller said, \u201cI think it could be equivalent to what we would have in nearby locations.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing sites for its data centers, Miller said Amazon looks for access to power, land and the ability to secure permits to build.\n\nClean power is a priority, too, because Amazon has committed to buy all its energy from renewable sources and because its Arlington site will be subject to Oregon\u2019s clean-energy mandates.\n\nThe Arlington site is served by PacifiCorp, the Portland-based utility owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s investment fund. The energy cooperative that serves Amazon in Morrow and Umatilla counties is exempt from Oregon\u2019s renewable energy requirements but investor-owned utilities like PacifiCorp are not.\n\nLast year, Amazon agreed to buy more than 200,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually from an Avangrid wind farm in Gilliam County. It will need a lot more than that to power the operations in Arlington and finding that power could be tricky, given the Northwest\u2019s constrained transmission grid and soaring demand for electricity throughout the region.\n\nSome data centers also use high volumes of water but the amount varies considerably based on the technology used to cool the servers.\n\nData centers don\u2019t employ nearly as many people as other heavy industries and Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose how many people work in its Oregon server farms. Employment data for Morrow and Umatilla counties suggests the company has created at least several hundred local jobs in that area, though, and probably a few thousand. Many more contractors travel to the sites during construction.\n\nThat means life for Gilliam County\u2019s 2,000 residents could be very different in the years ahead. Gilliam County Judge Cris Patnode, who serves as the county\u2019s administrator, said her constituents are just starting to wrap their heads around what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a major impact on the community and we need to make it a positive impact and we need to make sure that we capitalize on this opportunity,\u201d Patnode said.\n\nMuch will depend on the taxes Amazon pays, and the size of the tax breaks it receives.\n\nOregon puts no upper limit on the size of tax incentives local governments can offer to big industries. As a result, Amazon receives nearly $100 million in tax breaks every year on its Oregon data centers \u2013 far more than the $50 million it pays in local taxes and fees. Its Oregon incentives will save the company well over $1 billion in the years to come.\n\nArlington and Gilliam County haven\u2019t begun negotiating incentives with Amazon yet, according to Patnode. She said local officials have experience negotiating tax breaks for local clean energy projects and are studying lessons learned by nearby counties when they cut their deals with Amazon.\n\nAnd unlike some Oregon communities, which have relied on local officials and volunteers to negotiate with global tech companies, Patnode said Gilliam County will hire an attorney to help guide its talks with Amazon.\n\nThe county doesn\u2019t qualify for Oregon\u2019s enterprise zone program, which provides most of the state\u2019s data center tax breaks. Gilliam County\u2019s per capita income is too high and its unemployment rate is too low to participate in the incentive program for distressed areas.\n\nSo Patnode said officials will negotiate a deal under terms of the Strategic Investment Program, a similar arrangement that can offer local governments more flexibility in structuring an agreement.\n\nEven with tax breaks, Amazon\u2019s arrival could bring millions of dollars annually to the city and county.\n\nBufton and Patnode both say they hope to use some of those resources to encourage housing development so the people who work in Arlington can live there, too. They want more resources for schools, daycare, parks and other city services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the smallest counties in the state but we\u2019re going to be doing good, per capita,\u201d Bufton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of city amenities that we don\u2019t have and I would like to see that change.\u201d\n\nOfficials are already discussing whether they should begin preparing lots for new housing, Patnode said, in anticipation of the growth that would accompany Amazon\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cWhat an awesome opportunity we have for Arlington to make it beautiful and wonderful,\u201d Patnode said, \u201cand make sure this is not just a couple gas stations or a freeway town.\u201d\n\n-- Mike Rogoway covers Oregon technology and the state economy.

            "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and decisionmakers, click here.)\n\nMatt Garman took the helm at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing arm of the U.S. tech giant, in June, but he joined the business around 19 years ago as an intern. He went on to become AWS\u2019s first product manager and helped to build and launch many of its core services, before eventually becoming the CEO last year.\n\nLike many other tech companies, AWS, which is Amazon\u2019s most profitable unit, is betting big on AI. In April 2023, the company launched Amazon Bedrock, which gives cloud customers access to foundation models built by AI companies including Anthropic and Mistral. At its re:Invent conference in Las Vegas in December, AWS made a series of announcements, including a new generation of foundation AI models, called Nova. It also said that it\u2019s building one of the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputers with Anthropic, which it has a strategic partnership with, using a giant cluster of AWS\u2019s Trainium 2 training chips.\n\nTIME spoke with Garman a few days after the re:Invent conference, about his AI ambitions, how he\u2019s thinking about ensuring the technology is safe, and how the company is balancing its energy needs with its emissions targets.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhen you took over at AWS in June, there was a perception that Amazon had fallen behind somewhat in the AI race. What have your strategic priorities been for the business over the past few months?\n\nWe've had a long history of doing AI inside of AWS, and in fact, most of the most popular AI services that folks use, like SageMaker, for the last decade have all been built on AWS. With generative AI we started to really lean in, and particularly when ChatGPT came out, I think everybody was excited about that, and it sparked everyone's imagination. We [had] been working on generative AI, actually, for a little while before that. And our belief at the time, and it still remains now, was that that AI was going to be a transformational technology for every single industry and workflow and user experience that's out there. And because of who our customer base is, our strategy was always to build a robust, secure, performance featureful platform that people could really integrate into their actual businesses. And so we didn't rush really quickly to throw a chatbot up on our website. We really wanted to help people build a platform that could deeply integrate into their data, that would protect their data. That's their IP, and it's super important for them, so [we] had security front of mind, and gave you choice across a whole bunch of models, gave you capabilities across a whole bunch of things, and really helped you build into your application and figure out how you could actually get inference and really leverage this technology on an ongoing basis as a key part of what you do in your enterprise. And so that's what we've been building for the last couple of years. In the last year we started to see people realize that that is what they wanted to [do] and as companies started moving from launching a hundred proof of concepts to really wanting to move to production. They realized that the platform is what they needed. They had to be able to leverage their data. They wanted to customize models. They wanted to use a bunch of different models. They wanted to have guardrails. They needed to integrate with their own enterprise data sources, a lot of which lived on AWS, and so their applications were AWS.\n\nWe took that long-term view of: get the right build, the right platform, with the right security controls and the right capabilities, so that enterprises could build for the long term, as opposed to [trying to] get something out quickly. And so we're willing to accept the perception that people thought we were behind, because we had the conviction that we were building the right thing. And I think our customers largely agree.\n\nYou're offering $1 billion worth in cloud credits, in addition to millions previously, for startups. Do you see that opening up opportunities for closer tie-ups at an earlier stage with the next Anthropic or OpenAI?\n\nYeah, we've long invested in startups. It's one of the core customer bases that AWS has built our business on. We view startups as important to the success of AWS. They give us a lot of great insight. They love using cutting-edge technologies. They give us feedback on how we can improve our products. And frankly, they're the enterprises of tomorrow, so we want them to start building on AWS. And so from the very earliest days of AWS, startups have been critically important to us, and that's just doubling down on our commitment to them to help them get going. We recognize that as a startup, getting some help early on, before you get your business going, can make a huge difference. That's one of the things that we think helps us build that positive flywheel with that customer base. So we're super excited about continuing to work deeply with startups, and that commitment is part of that.\n\nYou're also building one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world, with the Trainium 2 chips. Is building the hardware and infrastructure for AI development at the center of your AI strategy?\n\nIt\u2019s a core part of it, for sure. We have this idea that across all of our AWS businesses, that choice is incredibly important for our customers. We want them to be able to choose from the very best technology, whether it comes from us or from third parties. Customers can pick the absolute best product for their application and for their use case and for what they're looking for from a cost performance trade-off. And so, on the AI side, we want to provide that same amount of choice. Building Tranium 2, which is our our second generation of high-performance AI chip, we think that's going to provide choice.\n\nNvidia is an incredibly important partner of ours. Today, the vast majority of AI workloads run on Nvidia technology, and we expect that to continue for a very long time. They make great products, and the team executes really well. And we're really excited about the choice that Trainium 2 brings. Cost is one of the things that a lot of people worry about when they think about some of these AI workloads, and we think that Trainium 2 can help lower the cost for a lot of customers. And so we're really excited about that, both for AI companies who are looking to train these massive clusters, [for example] Anthropic is going to be training their next generation, industry-leading model on Trainium 2\u2014We're building a giant cluster, it's five times the size of their last cluster\u2014but then the broad swath of folks that are doing inference or using Bedrock or making smaller clusters, I think there's a good opportunity for customers to lower costs with Trainium.\n\nThose clusters were 30% to 40% cheaper in comparison to Nvidia GPU clusters. What technical innovations are enabling these cost savings?\n\nNumber one is that the team has done a fantastic job and produced a really good chip that performs really well. And so from an absolute basis, it gives better performance for some workloads. It's very workload dependent, but even Apple [says] in early testing, they see up to 50% price performance benefit. That's massive, if you can really get 30%, 40%, even 50% gains. And some of that is pricing, where we focused on building a chip that we think we can really materially lower the cost to produce for customers. But also then increasing performance\u2014the team has built some innovations, where we see bottlenecks in AI training and inference, that we've built into the chips to improve particular function performance, etc. There are probably hundreds of thousands of things that go into delivering that type of performance, but we're quite excited about it and we're invested long term in the Trainium line.\n\nThe company recently announced the Nova foundation model. Is that aimed at competing directly with the likes of GPT-4 and Gemini?\n\nYes. We think it's important to have choice in the realm of these foundational models. Is it a direct competitor? We do think that we can deliver differentiated capabilities and performance. I think that this is such a big opportunity, and has such a material opportunity to change so many different workloads. These really large foundational models\u2014I think there'll be half a dozen to a dozen of them, probably less than 10. And I think they'll each be good at different things. [With] our Nova models, we focused on: how do we deliver a really low latency [and] great price performance? They're actually quite good at doing RAG [Retrieval-Augmented Generation] and agentic workflows. There's some other models that are better at other things today too. We'll keep pushing on it. I think there's room for a number of them, but we're very excited about the models and the customer reception has been really good.\n\nHow does your partnership with Anthropic fit into this strategy?\n\nI think they have one of the strongest AI teams in the world. They have the leading model in the world right now. I think most people consider Sonnet to be the top model for reasoning and for coding and for a lot of other things as well. We get a lot of great feedback from customers on them. So we love that partnership, and we learn a lot from them too, as they build their models on top of Trainium, so there's a nice flywheel benefit where we get to learn from them, building on top of us. Our customers get to take advantage of leveraging their models inside of Bedrock, and we can grow the business together.\n\nHow are you thinking about ensuring safety and responsibility in the development of AI?\n\nIt's super important. And it goes up and down the stack. One of the reasons why customers are excited about models from us, in addition to them being very performant, is that we care a ton about safety. And so there's a couple of things. One is, you have to start from the beginning when you're building the models, you think about, how do you have as many controls in there as possible? How do you have safe development to the models? And then I think you need belt and suspenders in this space, because you can, of course, make models say things that you can then say \u201coh, look what they said.\u201d Practically speaking our customers are trying to integrate these into their applications. And different from being able to produce a recipe for a bomb or something, which we definitely want to have security controls around, safety and control models actually extends specific to very use cases. If you're building an insurance application, you don't want your application to give out healthcare advice, whereas, if you're building healthcare one, you may. So we give a lot of controls to the customers so that they can build guardrails around the responses for models to really help guide how they want models to answer those questions. We launched a number of enhancements at re:Invent including what we call automated reasoning checks, which actually can give you a mathematical proof for if we can be 100% sure that an answer coming back is correct, based on the corpus of data that you have fed into the model. Eliminating hallucinations for a subset of answers is also super important. What's unsafe in the context of a customer's application can vary pretty widely, and so we try to give some really good controls for customers to be able to define that, because it's going to depend on the use cases.\n\nEnergy requirements are a huge challenge for this business. Amazon is committed to a net zero emissions target by 2040 and you reported some progress there. How are you planning to continue reducing emissions while investing in large-scale infrastructure for AI?\n\nNumber one is you just have to have that long term view as to how we ensure that the world has enough carbon-zero power. We've been the single biggest purchaser of renewable energy deals, new energy deals to the grid, so commissioning new solar\u2014solar farms, or wind farms, etc. We've been the biggest corporate purchaser each of the last five years, and will continue to do that. Even on that path, that may not be fast enough, and so we've actually started investing in nuclear. I do think that that's an important component. It'll be part of that portfolio. It can be both large scale nuclear plants as well as, we've invested in and we're very bullish about small modular reactor technology, which is probably six or seven years out from really being in mass production. But we're optimistic that that can be another solve as part of that portfolio as well.\n\nOn the path to carbon zero across the whole business, there's a lot of invention that's still going to need to happen. And I won\u2019t sit here and tell you we know all of the answers of how you're going to have carbon-zero shipping across oceans and airplanes for the retail side of it. And there's a whole bunch of challenges that the world has to go after, but that's part of why we made that commitment. We're putting together plans with with milestones along the way, because it's an incredibly important target for us. There's a lot of work to do but we're committed to doing it.\n\nAnd as part of that nuclear piece, you're supporting the development of these nuclear energy projects. What are you doing to ensure that the projects are safe in the communities where they're deployed?\n\nLook, I actually think one of the worst things for the environment was the mistakes the nuclear industry made back in the \u201950s, because it made everyone feel like technology wasn't that safe, which it may not have been way back then, but, it's been 70 years, and technology has evolved, and it is actually an incredibly safe, secure technology now. And so a lot of these things are actually fully self-contained and there is no risk of big meltdown or those kind of events that happened before. It's a super safe technology that has been well-tested and has been in production across the world safely for multiple decades now. There's still some fear, I think, from people, but, actually, increasingly, many geographies are realizing it's a quite safe technology.\n\nWhat do you want to see in terms of policy from the new presidential administration?\n\nWe consider the U.S. government to be one of our most important customers that we support up and down the board and will continue to do so. So we're very excited, and we know many of those folks and are excited to continue to work on that mission together, because we do view it as a mission. It's both a good business for us, but it's also an ability to help our country move faster, to control costs, to be more agile. And I think it's super important, as you think about where the world is going, for our government to have access to the latest technologies. I do think AI and technology is increasingly becoming an incredibly important part of our national defense, probably as much so as guns and other things like that, and so we take that super seriously, and we're excited to work with the administration. I'm optimistic that President Trump and his administration can help us loosen some of the restrictions on helping build data centers faster. I'm hopeful that they can help us cut through some of that bureaucratic red tape and move faster. I think that'll be important, particularly as we want to maintain the AI lead for the U.S. ahead of China and others.\n\nWhat have you learned about leadership over the course of your career?\n\nWe're fortunate at Amazon to be able to attract some of the most talented, most driven leaders and employees in the world, and I've been fortunate enough to get to work with some of those folks [and] to try to clear barriers for them so that they can go deliver outstanding results for our customers. I think if we have a smart team that is really focused on solving customer problems versus growing their own scope of responsibility or internal goals, [and] if you can get those teams focused on that and get barriers out of their way and remove obstacles, then we can deliver a lot. And so that's largely my job. I view myself as not the expert in any one particular thing. Every one of my team is usually better at whatever we're trying to do than I am. And my job is to let them go do their job as much as possible, and occasionally connect dots for them on where there's other parts of the company or other parts of the organization or other customer input that they may not have, that they can integrate and incorporate.\n\nYou've worked closely with Andy Jassy, is there anything in particular that you\u2019ve learned from watching him as a leader?\n\nI've learned a ton. He's a he's an exceptional leader. Andy is very good at having very high standards and having high expectations for the teams, and high standards for what we deliver for customers. He had a lot of the vision, together with some of the core folks who were starting AWS, of some important tenets of how we think about the business, of focusing on security and operational excellence and really focusing on how we go deliver for customers.\n\nWhat are your priorities for 2025?\n\nOur first priority always is to maintain outstanding security and operational excellence. We want to help customers get ready for that AI transformation that's going to happen. Part of that, though, is also helping get all of their applications in a place that they can take advantage of AI. So it's a hugely important priority for us to help customers continue on that migration to the cloud, because if their data is stuck on premise and legacy data stores and other things, they won't be able to take advantage of AI. So helping people modernize their data and analytics stacks to get that into the cloud and get their data links into a cloud and organized in a way that they can really start to take advantage of AI, is that is a big priority for us. And then it's just, how do we help scale the AI capabilities, bring the cost down for customers, while [we] keep adding the value. And for 2025, our goal is for customers to move AI workloads really into production that deliver great ROI for their businesses. And that crosses making sure all their data is in the right place, and make sure they have the right compute platforms. We think Trainium is going to be an important part of that. The last bit is helping add some applications on top. We think that we can add [the] extra benefit of helping employees and others get that effectiveness. Some of that is moving contact centers to the cloud. Some of that is helping get conversational assistants and AI assistants in the hands of employees, and so Amazon Q is a big part of that for us. And then it's also just empowering our broad partner ecosystem to go fast and help customers evolve as well.",

            "content": "Amazon workers vote against unionizing a North Carolina warehouse\n\ntoggle caption Scott Sharpe/The News & Observer via Getty Images\n\nAmazon workers in North Carolina have voted against unionizing as the retail giant once again prevailed in its fight against labor organizing.\n\nAround 4,300 workers at a warehouse in Garner, N.C., a suburb of Raleigh, were eligible to cast ballots over the past week. They voted whether to join the grassroots union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE.\n\nWorkers voted nearly 3-to-1 against unionizing. Federal labor officials' tally showed 829 votes in favor and 2,447 votes against, with 77 ballots set aside as challenged by either the union or the company.\n\nUnion organizers, who are current and former workers, said they would push for higher wages, more reliable hours, better safety measures and other changes. They faced a staunch opposition campaign by Amazon, which has long fought off efforts to organize its packers, delivery drivers and other employees.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a statement, representatives of the CAUSE union said they had succeeded in getting a union vote in a few months \"against all odds.\"\n\n\"We will continue organizing: this is only the beginning and we are building momentum in this struggle for worker power,\" they wrote. \"Now it is time to regroup and strategize beyond the legal structures that were never made to work for us.\"\n\nAmazon, which is the nation's second-largest private employer in the U.S. after Walmart, for its part has argued that its employees benefit from working without the involvement of unions and that it already offers better pay and perks than most in the industry.\n\n\"We're glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" company spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a statement on Saturday. \"We look forward to continuing to make this a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.\"\n\nIn January, workers at one Amazon-owned Whole Foods location in Philadelphia voted to become the first unionized store in the chain. Whole Foods has since asked the National Labor Relations Board to disqualify the union's win, in part because the federal agency no longer has enough board members to certify the vote since President Trump fired a Democratic member.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe company continues to legally challenge its first unionized warehouse, in New York, nearly three years since the historic vote. In that time, the finances and internal cohesion of that upstart Amazon Labor Union deteriorated. The group has joined forces with the powerful International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\nThe Teamsters separately organized some of Amazon's delivery drivers, though the company also does not recognize this representation. In December, the union led drivers and warehouse workers in picketing multiple locations around the U.S., trying to draw more people into the union fold and press Amazon to begin negotiating collective-bargaining contracts.\n\nAmazon is also appealing a November ruling by a federal labor judge that ordered a third union election \u2014 a re-redo \u2014 at a warehouse in Alabama. In the original 2021 vote, workers overwhelmingly rejected the union. U.S. labor officials later found Amazon illegally influenced the result. The second election's results remained too close to call for over two years, as the union and the company accused each other of breaking labor laws.\n\nAmazon workers and federal labor investigators have filed numerous complaints alleging labor-law violations and illegal union-busting tactics by the company, which Amazon has denied and legally challenged. In fact, one of the company's lawsuits has questioned the very existence of the National Labor Relations Board, arguing its structure violates the Constitution.\n\nNPR's James Doubek contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters.",

Saturday's vote totaled 829 workers voting yes to unionize and 2,447 workers voting no.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Eileen Hards released a statement following the vote saying:\n\n\"We're glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon.

But despite the vote, they said as the cost of living continues to rapidly increase in the Triangle, their fight for better conditions and wages is even more important.\n\n\"Yes, we deserve more money because Amazon is a corporate empire, the fourth richest company in the world.

The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.\n\nRev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \"We had already braced ourselves for a loss.\"\n\n\"We knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\" Brown said. \"One, we're in the South. Two, the average worker that's in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\"\n\nThe outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.\n\nIn 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.\n\nAt the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nIn November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.\n\nWorkers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022. Co-founder Brown said in an interview last month he started organizing because he felt like Amazon was not providing workers adequate protections against COVID-19.\n\nThe company said Saturday that Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting, such as safe and inclusive workplaces and competitive pay.\n\n\"We're glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a written statement.",

According to the National Labor Relations Board, at least 30% of workers need to sign cards or a petition saying they want a union in order for the NLRB to conduct an election.\n\nA spokesperson for the NLRB said it had no comment. The board\u2019s count of more than 4,700 eligible voters showed only 3,276 valid votes were cast. Of the votes, 77 ballots were challenged by one side or the other and not opened. Another 10 were void.\n\nCAUSE alleged that Amazon had interfered with the vote-counting process.\n\n\u201cThe election results today are a result of Amazon\u2019s willingness to break the law and use its enormous wealth to try and break our movement,\u201d the grassroots union said in a statement.\n\nCAUSE added that it \u201cwill continue to organize because over half of Amazon employees are still struggling with food and housing insecurity.\u201d The union, which started in 2022, said Amazon employees work for a multi-billion dollar corporation and deserve a living wage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\u201d said Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to make this a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, workers at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse voted to join the Amazon Labor Union, the company\u2019s first union.\n\nAmazon has defeated union organizing votes twice at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama, as well as at a second Staten Island facility next to the one that voted for the union, as well as one just outside of Albany, New York.\n\nAmazon has faced increased pressure from unions, despite its efforts to stave them off.\n\nUnions face strong pushback\n\nThe workers at the Garner facility, where the company says a starting wage is $18.50 an hour and the top hourly wage is $23.80, were seeking wages of $30 an hour.\n\n\u201cI would challenge anyone to say $20 an hour is a livable wage here,\u201d Italo Medelius-Marsano, one of the leaders of the organizing effort, told CNN ahead of the vote. \u201cIn the Raleigh area, that\u2019s a slap in the face. Given the profits at Amazon and what it\u2019s worth, $30 an hour is incredibly reasonable.\u201d\n\nAmazon has a market cap of about $2.4 trillion and made $59 billion in net income in 2024, nearly double what it made the year before. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote, the company said it believed its workers in Garner and elsewhere would prefer not to be in a union.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits,\u201d Hards said in a statement ahead of the vote.\n\nNorth Carolina has also been hostile to union efforts. The state has the lowest percentage of union membership among workers of any state \u2014 only 2.4% of workers overall.\n\nThere\u2019s a cultural resistance to unions, like many other right-to-work states, said Jeff Hirsch, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe state also has a powerful Chamber of Commerce and various industry groups \u201crepresenting employers that would prefer that no new worker protections be passed,\u201d said Clermont Ripley, director of the Workers\u2019 Rights Project Director at the North Carolina Justice Center.\n\nBut there is more organizing happening throughout the state, Ripley noted, especially after the Covid pandemic when essential workers began advocating for better treatment.\n\n\u201cI already knew that history wasn\u2019t on our side,\u201d said Rev. Ryan Brown, CAUSE\u2019s president and co-founder, after the vote results. \u201cI had braced myself for this loss, recognizing that the probability and the odds were against us.\u201d",

            "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes\n\nMARRIOTT-SLATERVILLE, Weber County \u2014 A vacant 3-year-old facility meant to be an Amazon distribution center is in the process of getting upgrades so it can finally enter into operation.\n\nMarriott-Slaterville city attorney Bill Morris said contractors have pulled a total of four permits so far to get the structure operating, including one to install electric vehicle chargers in the parking lot of the facility. Another permit allows for the remodel of the conveyor and package delivery system inside the building.\n\n\"Amazon, they're moving ahead with opening up,\" said Morris, who, as city attorney has been intimately involved with the company's plans to expand to Marriott-Slaterville. \"It's good to see that they're finally gearing up and will open and be hiring.\"\n\nHe understands the facility is to start operating as a distribution facility this year, possibly as early as this spring, and that it will employ up to 600, as previously anticipated. The renewed efforts to get the structure up to speed started in December, Morris said, and Rocky Mountain Power extended a new power line to the site last month.\n\nThe 185,000-square-foot warehouse structure off 400 North on the east side of I-15 was finished in 2022 but has sat inactive since then, prompting plenty of speculation from the public about its future. Somehow, word has spread about the possibility of the facility finally starting distribution operations, and Morris said some job-seekers have contacted city staffers looking for more information.\n\n\"I have people walking in, even, saying, 'Hey, I'm looking for a job. When do they open?' But I don't have a contact. I don't know,\" Morris said.\n\nAmazon officials were tight-lipped when contacted but hinted at the possibility of movement at the site.\n\n\"We are actively using the Marriott-Slaterville facility as an equipment hub to support our operations across the country. This site has also remained in our plans to launch as a delivery station,\" Nissa LaPoint, a regional Amazon media contact, said. She referenced an \"upcoming announcement\" about the site, possibly in the spring.\n\nSalt Lake City-based Gardner Batt owns the building and built it with plans to lease to Amazon. Michael Batt, one of the company founders, hinted at the possibility of forward movement, like LaPoint, but didn't get specific. \"They are completing some electrical changes to accommodate their latest systems, and they intend to be using the building in the near future,\" he said.\n\nAt any rate, there were numerous workers in the lot outside the expansive white-and-blue building on Tuesday. Morris said they are installing charging stations to serve the fleet of electric trucks that'll be used to make package deliveries. Those charging stations necessitated the Rocky Mountain Power extension of the power line.\n\nWhile the anticipated jobs have been cause for much of the interest from the public, the specter of increased truck traffic around the facility has also been a focus. Morris said delivery trucks would come and go from the facility during off-peak hours to minimize potential congestion in and around the 400 North/I-15 intersection, which gets busy at times. Delivery trucks would likely leave and be gone much of the day making deliveries, chiefly within Weber County, though an estimated 50 semitrailers a day are also expected with the packages ready for final distribution. \"It's the last-mile distribution center,\" he said.\n\nAs speculation simmered about the Marriott-Slaterville facility, Retail Dive, a trade publication, reported in 2023 that it was one of many across the country Amazon had \"canceled, closed or delayed\" as the online company looked to trim costs.",

Customers can benefit from lower total VDM charges without the need to change account configuration, sending practices, or billing setup. This can lower customer total cost of ownership for VDM as their usage increases.\n\n\n\nPreviously, all customers using VDM paid a fixed price per message sent. Customers could turn VDM on or off whenever needed, and they paid only for what they used without any commitment or fixed monthly charges. Now, customers will see their charges per message for VDM decrease as their sending volume exceeds specific thresholds each month. After crossing each threshold in a given billing month, each subsequent message processed by VDM is charged at a lower rate. This reduces the total cost of using VDM for high volume senders.\n\n\n\nSES supports tiered pricing for VDM in all AWS regions where SES is available.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the documentation for the SES pricing page.",

(File photo: Thomson Reuters)\n\nListen to this article Listen to this article\n\nAmazon has purchased a piece of land on what was formerly the Thomson Reuters campus in Eagan for $52.5 million in cash, according to a certificate of real estate value released Thursday.\n\nThe CRV says the property will be used for a distribution warehouse, which aligns with the master plan for development for the Thomson Reuters campus, a plan that was passed by the Eagan City Council in November.\n\nThe development master plan that was considered in November labeled this parcel of land as \u201cProject Nova.\u201d The campus is at 610 Opperman Drive in Eagan.\n\nAccording to a description of the proposal, the now Amazon-owned land will have a building with a \u201cmulti-story 650,000 square footprint\u201d property that could total 3.6 million square feet. There will be 1,274 parking spaces, along with 428 trailer parking stalls and 56 loading docks.\n\nThis $52.5 million trade continues a strong relationship between Ryan and the online retail giant. Both in the metro and the rest of the nation, the developer has built a number projects for Amazon. Ryan completed Project Bell in Woodbury for Amazon about four years ago. Earlier this year, Ryan proposed \u201cProject Wrangler,\u201d a building with a similar look to Project Bell, to Woodbury but only confirmed that the end-user was a household name in the online retail space.\n\nThe entirety of the development plan aims to transform 179 acres of land into industrial properties, townhomes and single-family homes. Though a purchase agreement was struck earlier last year, Ryan closed on the site in late December 2024, buying it for $41 million.\n\nEarly December saw Eagan give the green light to a 104-unit townhome development pitched by Lennar Corp. This development will sit to the northwest of the future Amazon distribution center.\n\nA Ryan spokesperson declined to comment on this story when reached by Finance & Commerce.\n\nRyan\u2019s redevelopment of the Thomson Reuters campus comes as the business conglomerate announced it would be vacating most of the campus except for a print manufacturing facility. However, the company remains in Eagan, having moved into The Landing near TCO Performance Center at Viking Lakes.\n\nColliers Senior Vice President John McCarthy said in a December interview that Ryan and Eagan had made good efforts to rework the campus for mixed uses. McCarthy was involved in the transaction between Ryan and Thomson Reuters, but he was not involved in the lot sale between Ryan and Amazon.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like trying to turn the Titanic,\u201d McCarthy said of office campuses. \u201cIt takes big movements but they\u2019re always generally good real estate, good locations.\u201d\n\nThe building of distribution centers is not the only business in the forefront for Amazon. The retailer\u2019s data services group purchased a 378-acre Becker site back in early November for $73.7 million, according to a CRV.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEagan OKs 104-unit townhome development\n\nHempel aims for TIF for West End apartment project\n\nPrice for Thomson Reuters campus is $41 million",

            "content": "AI agents continue to gain momentum, as businesses use the power of generative AI to reinvent customer experiences and automate complex workflows. We are seeing Amazon Bedrock Agents applied in investment research, insurance claims processing, root cause analysis, advertising campaigns, and much more. Agents use the reasoning capability of foundation models (FMs) to break down user-requested tasks into multiple steps. They use developer-provided instructions to create an orchestration plan and carry out that plan by securely invoking company APIs and accessing knowledge bases using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to accurately handle the user\u2019s request.\n\nAlthough organizations see the benefit of agents that are defined, configured, and tested as managed resources, we have increasingly seen the need for an additional, more dynamic way to invoke agents. Organizations need solutions that adjust on the fly\u2014whether to test new approaches, respond to changing business rules, or customize solutions for different clients. This is where the new inline agents capability in Amazon Bedrock Agents becomes transformative. It allows you to dynamically adjust your agent\u2019s behavior at runtime by changing its instructions, tools, guardrails, knowledge bases, prompts, and even the FMs it uses\u2014all without redeploying your application.\n\nIn this post, we explore how to build an application using Amazon Bedrock inline agents, demonstrating how a single AI assistant can adapt its capabilities dynamically based on user roles.\n\nInline agents in Amazon Bedrock Agents\n\nThis runtime flexibility enabled by inline agents opens powerful new possibilities, such as:\n\nRapid prototyping \u2013 Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes. Developers can instantly test different combinations of models, tools, and knowledge bases, dramatically accelerating the development process.\n\n\u2013 Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes.

Dynamic tool selection \u2013 Developers can create applications with hundreds of APIs, and quickly and accurately carry out tasks by dynamically choosing a small subset of APIs for the agent to consider for a given request. This is particularly helpful for large software as a service (SaaS) platforms needing multi-tenant scaling.\n\nInline agents expand your options for building and deploying agentic solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents. For workloads needing managed and versioned agent resources with a pre-determined and tested configuration (specific model, instructions, tools, and so on), developers can continue to use InvokeAgent on resources created with CreateAgent. For workloads that need dynamic runtime behavior changes for each agent invocation, you can use the new InvokeInlineAgent API. With either approach, your agents will be secure and scalable, with configurable guardrails, a flexible set of model inference options, native access to knowledge bases, code interpretation, session memory, and more.\n\nSolution overview\n\nOur HR assistant example shows how to build a single AI assistant that adapts to different user roles using the new inline agent capabilities in Amazon Bedrock Agents. When users interact with the assistant, the assistant dynamically configures agent capabilities (such as model, instructions, knowledge bases, action groups, and guardrails) based on the user\u2019s role and their specific selections. This approach creates a flexible system that adjusts its functionality in real time, making it more efficient than creating separate agents for each user role or tool combination. The complete code for this HR assistant example is available on our GitHub repo.\n\nThis dynamic tool selection enables a personalized experience. When an employee logs in without direct reports, they see a set of tools that they have access to based on their role. They can select from options like requesting vacation time, checking company policies using the knowledge base, using a code interpreter for data analysis, or submitting expense reports. The inline agent assistant is then configured with only these selected tools, allowing it to assist the employee with their chosen tasks. In a real-world example, the user would not need to make the selection, because the application would make that decision and automatically configure the agent invocation at runtime. We make it explicit in this application so that you can demonstrate the impact.\n\nSimilarly, when a manager logs in to the same system, they see an extended set of tools reflecting their additional permissions. In addition to the employee-level tools, managers have access to capabilities like running performance reviews. They can select which tools they want to use for their current session, instantly configuring the inline agent with their choices.\n\nThe inclusion of knowledge bases is also adjusted based on the user\u2019s role. Employees and managers see different levels of company policy information, with managers getting additional access to confidential data like performance review and compensation details. For this demo, we\u2019ve implemented metadata filtering to retrieve only the appropriate level of documents based on the user\u2019s access level, further enhancing efficiency and security.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the interface adapts to different user roles.\n\nThe employee view provides access to essential HR functions like vacation requests, expense submissions, and company policy lookups. Users can select which of these tools they want to use for their current session.\n\nThe manager view extends these options to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent can be configured with a broader set of tools based on user permissions.\n\nThe manager view extends these capabilities to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent dynamically adjusts its available tools based on user permissions. Without inline agents, we would need to build and maintain two separate agents.\n\nAs shown in the preceding screenshots, the same HR assistant offers different tool selections based on the user\u2019s role. An employee sees options like Knowledge Base, Apply Vacation Tool, and Submit Expense, whereas a manager has additional options like Performance Evaluation. Users can select which tools they want to add to the agent for their current interaction.\n\nThis flexibility allows for quick adaptation to user needs and preferences. For instance, if the company introduces a new policy for creating business travel requests, the tool catalog can be quickly updated to include a Create Business Travel Reservation tool. Employees can then choose to add this new tool to their agent configuration when they need to plan a business trip, or the application could automatically do so based on their role.\n\nWith Amazon Bedrock inline agents, you can create a catalog of actions that is dynamically selected by the application or by users of the application. This increases the level of flexibility and adaptability of your solutions, making them a perfect fit for navigating the complex, ever-changing landscape of modern business operations. Users have more control over their AI assistant\u2019s capabilities, and the system remains efficient by only loading the necessary tools for each interaction.\n\nTechnical foundation: Dynamic configuration and action selection\n\nInline agents allow dynamic configuration at runtime, enabling a single agent to effectively perform the work of many. By specifying action groups and modifying instructions on the fly, even within the same session, you can create versatile AI applications that adapt to various scenarios without multiple agent deployments.\n\nThe following are key points about inline agents:\n\nRuntime configuration \u2013 Change the agent\u2019s configuration, including its FM, at runtime. This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation without redeploying the application, reducing development cycles.\n\n\u2013 Change the agent\u2019s configuration, including its FM, at runtime.

Agent efficiency \u2013 Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy. With fewer tools to choose from, it\u2019s less complicated for the agent to select the right one, reducing hallucinations in the tool selection process. This approach can also lead to lower costs and improved latency compared to static agents because removing unnecessary tools, knowledge bases, and instructions reduces the number of input and output tokens being processed by the agent\u2019s large language model (LLM).\n\n\u2013 Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy.

Implement access control \u2013 We implemented role-based access control. The application backend checks the user\u2019s role (employee or manager) and provides access to appropriate tools and information and passes this information to the inline agent. The role information is also used to configure metadata filtering in the knowledge bases to generate relevant responses. The system allows for dynamic tool use at runtime. Users can switch personas or add and remove tools during their session, allowing the agent to adapt to different conversation needs in real time. Integrate the agent with other services and tools \u2013 We connected the inline agent to: Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for company policies, with metadata filtering for role-based access.\n\nAWS Lambda functions for executing specific actions (such as submitting vacation requests or expense reports).\n\nA code interpreter tool for performing calculations and data analysis. Create the UI \u2013 We created a Flask-based UI that performs the following actions: Displays available tools based on the user\u2019s role.\n\nAllows users to select different personas.\n\nProvides a chat window for interacting with the HR assistant.\n\nTo understand how this dynamic role-based functionality works under the hood, let\u2019s examine the following system architecture diagram.\n\nAs shown in preceding architecture diagram, the system works as follows:\n\nThe end-user logs in and is identified as either a manager or an employee. The user selects the tools that they have access to and makes a request to the HR assistant. The agent breaks down the problems and uses the available tools to solve for the query in steps, which may include: Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (with metadata filtering for role-based access). Lambda functions for specific actions. Code interpreter tool for calculations. Compensation tool (accessible only to managers to submit base pay raise requests). The application uses the Amazon Bedrock inline agent to dynamically pass in the appropriate tools based on the user\u2019s role and request. The agent uses the selected tools to process the request and provide a response to the user.\n\nThis approach provides a flexible, scalable solution that can quickly adapt to different user roles and changing business needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we introduced the Amazon Bedrock inline agent functionality and highlighted its application to an HR use case. We dynamically selected tools based on the user\u2019s roles and permissions, adapted instructions to set a conversation tone, and selected different models at runtime. With inline agents, you can transform how you build and deploy AI assistants. By dynamically adapting tools, instructions, and models at runtime, you can:\n\nCreate personalized experiences for different user roles\n\nOptimize costs by matching model capabilities to task complexity\n\nStreamline development and maintenance\n\nScale efficiently without managing multiple agent configurations\n\nFor organizations demanding highly dynamic behavior\u2014whether you\u2019re an AI startup, SaaS provider, or enterprise solution team\u2014inline agents offer a scalable approach to building intelligent assistants that grow with your needs. To get started, explore our GitHub repo and HR assistant demo application, which demonstrate key implementation patterns and best practices.\n\nTo learn more about how to be most successful in your agent journey, read our two-part blog series:\n\nTo get started with Amazon Bedrock Agents, check out the following GitHub repository with example code.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nIshan Singh is a Generative AI Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services, where he helps customers build innovative and responsible generative AI solutions and products.

            "content": "Activism / How Amazon Is Taking Its Union-Busting to New Heights Organizers describe fear tactics, amped-up security, and daily town halls as workers vote on whether to unionize.\n\nThe Rev. Ryan Brown and Mary \u201cMa Mary\u201d Hill show their signed union cards on September 2, 2024.\n\n(Courtesy of CAUSE)\n\nAmazon\u2019s RDU1 fulfillment center is a nearly windowless 2 million-square-foot box squatting along Jones Sausage Road outside Raleigh, North Carolina. In early February, a new structure cropped up on its property line\u2014an 8\u00d78 bright yellow tent cutting a striking silhouette against the gray warehouse. Affixed to the tent poles are signs with big block letters (\u201cVote union yes\u201d) and pale blue flags emblazoned with a fist gripping an instantly identifiable icon\u2014the orange Amazon \u201csmile\u201d arrow, inverted as a frown.\n\nAs workers stream out of the warehouse at the end of their shift, many stop by the tent to grab a sub or a shirt, or to ask a question. For two weeks, this is the headquarters for Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, the union that filed for an NLRB election in December. Between February 10 and 15, RDU1 workers are voting on whether to become the second Amazon warehouse to unionize through a National Labor Relations Board election in the United States.\n\nLeading up to the election, Amazon has deployed its now-familiar union-busting arsenal to quash the worker-led movement at the nearly 5,000-person warehouse. Managers and HR professionals from across the country have flown in to patrol the shop floor and repeat anti-union talking points in small group meetings and warehouse-wide town halls. The company erected metal barricades between CAUSE\u2019s tent and the warehouse. An anti-union video plays on an endless loop in the break room. \u201cThis place is starting to turn into a labor camp,\u201d said Italo Medelius, an RDU1 worker and organizer with CAUSE.\n\nThe movement to unionize Amazon\u2019s Garner warehouse has been three years in the making. CAUSE\u2019s president, the Rev. Ryan Brown, started organizing with his coworkers in January 2022 because he felt the company was not adequately protecting workers from Covid-19. Medelius learned about the union when Brown approached him for help translating a petition into Spanish calling for fans inside the warehouse. \u201cPeople were literally fainting from heat stroke during the summers,\u201d said Medelius. CAUSE won that demand, proving to RDU1 workers that collective organizing can deliver results. (Amazon denies that there have been any instances of work-related heat stroke at RDU1. In 2023 The News & Observer reported that two RDU1 workers were hospitalized after feeling faint on the job, which they attributed partly to the temperature in the warehouse.)\n\nIn January 2024, CAUSE decided to begin collecting union authorization cards. Organizers developed a strategic roadmap to secure the National Labor Relations Board\u2013required 30 percent of signatures to trigger a union election, including fundraising and forming organizing committees for the day and night shifts, and for Spanish-speaking workers. By December, CAUSE had collected cards from 42 percent of workers.\n\nCAUSE is demanding $30 an hour for associates, paid sick leave, and increasing break times from 30 minutes to an hour. Currently, starting pay at RDU1 is $18.50 an hour\u2014and that\u2019s after they raised wages for fulfillment and transportation by $1.50 in September. \u201cIf they paid a living wage, people wouldn\u2019t have to be sleeping in their car to go to their second job,\u201d said Mary Dulberg, an RDU1 worker who has been involved with CAUSE since its founding.\n\nWorkers are also asking for dignity at work, and respect for workers of all nationalities and ethnicities. At a warehouse where Hispanic workers make up a large portion of the workforce, Medelius said he often has to accompany his coworkers to HR meetings to translate for them. \u201cThe organizing conversations that have been the most poignant have been with our Spanish speakers, with our Arabic speakers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to have some sort of language justice in this warehouse.\u201d CAUSE\u2019s newsletter is published in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and an audio version. Medelius noted that Amazon has made sure to translate its union-busting materials into Spanish. (Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, said, \u201cAt all of our facilities, we work to foster a culture of inclusion with employees. We welcome people from many backgrounds, experiences and prior careers to join us.\u201d)\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, Amazon has installed new security equipment and implemented policies that workers say make them feel surveilled. In December 2024, during CAUSE\u2019s card collecting campaign, Amazon began requiring workers to show their employee badges to enter the parking lot. Organizers also say the company added new security outposts to all of the building entrances. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to instill fear and almost militarize the place,\u201d said Medelius.\u201d\n\nHards, the Amazon spokesperson, said, \u201cThe safety of our team continues to be our top priority. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve had several incidents where individuals have trespassed and refused to leave our property, which is why we\u2019ve added additional security measures to the site.\u201d In December, Garner police arrested two community members and a former Amazon worker who were distributing food and helping to collect union cards outside the warehouse. On the eve of the election, police arrested an organizer from Amazon\u2019s Staten Island warehouse who traveled to help with the campaign.\n\nAmazon workers are already subject to surveillance by algorithmic management tactics that constantly track their pace of work. Teke Wiggin, a sociologist at Northwestern, studied the 2021 union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, and found that Amazon deployed its management technology not just to discipline workers but also suppress collective organizing. Wiggin\u2019s new paper, \u201cWeaponizing the Workplace,\u201d outlines how Amazon used digital displays at workstations and the employee app A to Z to flood workers with anti-union messages and heighten workers\u2019 sense that they were being watched. He told me, \u201cAmazon\u2019s working conditions and capacities make a free and fair election impossible.\u201d\n\nLike at the Bessemer warehouse, where the union lost its election, Amazon has bombarded RDU1 workers with texts and messages on A to Z. A screenshot provided to me showed a notification with a red \u201calert\u201d symbol reading, \u201cSomething to lose? A union can trade away things you value, like paid-for training and education, shift choice, or your Day 1 health coverage, for priorities they care more about\u2014like dues deducted directly from your paycheck.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for workers to ignore anti-union messages sent through A to Z, because they need to use the app to get important information about their shifts and pay. \u201cAmazon can force-feed them messaging in a way that employers haven\u2019t been able to in the past,\u201d said Wiggin.\n\nAt the Garner warehouse, where the majority of workers are Black or Hispanic, managers have used these fear tactics to stoke racial divisions, organizers say. \u201cAmazon\u2019s strategy right now is to divide and conquer,\u201d said Medelius. \u201cThey have been putting out all of these lies and trying to create tensions between Black and brown communities.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon employee relations specialist leads a meeting discouraging workers from unionizing. (Courtesy of CAUSE)\n\nA video recording of an anti-union \u201ctown hall\u201d meeting captured an operations manager telling workers, \u201cI\u2019ve heard CAUSE telling people that if you vote no, you can be deported.\u201d CAUSE\u2019s lawyer has reached out to Amazon\u2019s counsel about this claim, which they see as potentially slanderous. \u201cWe know that Amazon is pulling incredibly illegal and really dirty tactics by using people\u2019s fears against them,\u201d said Medelius. \u201cEspecially when it comes to immigration, that is just a very, very low blow.\u201d (According to Amazon, \u201cClaims made by CAUSE of racism from managers is completely false and we have had no internal complaints filed from employees about this type of behavior.\u201d)\n\nRDU1 has hosted daily \u201ctown hall\u201d meetings in the week leading up to the election, where managers deliver speeches and dance on stage, backed by a live DJ, to hype workers up to oppose the union. \u201cIt looks like MLM shit,\u201d Dulberg told me.\n\nIn a video of one such assembly, managers delivered impassioned, occasionally personal pleas for workers to vote no. One Amazon operations director tearfully invoked the story of her young daughter\u2019s struggle with leukemia to convince workers that CAUSE may not deliver on its promises. \u201cYou could lose the things that are most important to you and your family,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it was benefits. Because that was the thing that kept my daughter alive 12 months longer than she probably should have been.\u201d\n\nDulberg said she found the comments \u201cgross\u201d and insensitive to workers in the audience who have themselves struggled with infertility or the death of a child.\n\nAmazon stressed that these meetings are voluntary and that it communicates that to its employees. Hards told me, \u201cOur employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. We believe that both decisions should be equally protected which is why we talk openly, candidly and respectfully about these topics, actively sharing facts with employees so they can use that information to make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nA CAUSE member stands next to the organization\u2019s flag during a group gathering. (Courtesy of CAUSE)\n\nAmazon managers, however, seemed to mischaracterize how unions function to sway workers. In an audio recording shared with me of a small-group \u201cvoluntary informational session,\u201d an operations manager implies that workers who choose not to pay union dues will not receive union benefits. (North Carolina is a right-to-work state, so workers can opt out of paying union dues.) \u201cIf I choose not to pay, and you pay, and we both have a problem, and we go to talk to somebody, [is CAUSE] going to take care of me if I don\u2019t choose to pay into it?\u201d he says. \u201c[If] I\u2019m not attending the meetings because I\u2019m not a dues-paying member, how do you take care of me?\u201d\n\nAmazon seemed to repeat the claim that workers who do not pay dues may not receive union benefits on flyers posted in and around bathrooms (dubbed \u201cinSTALLments\u201d by the company). The poster reads, \u201cWho will CAUSE really care about? CAUSE represents its paying members. We care about giving every individual a voice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Celine McNicholas, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, the idea that the union would provide benefits only to dues-paying members is false. \u201cIt is essentially the opposite situation in right-to-work states,\u201d she wrote to me in an e-mail. \u201cNon-dues paying members still receive the benefit of union representation without paying for the representation.\u201d\n\nAs workers cast their votes, organizers hope their message will cut through the constant thrum of anti-union rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019m watching three years of work and holding my breath,\u201d said Dulberg. Amazon organizers from across the country have traveled to North Carolina to support CAUSE, including Teamsters organizers, workers at Amazon\u2019s Kentucky air hub, and Chris Smalls, the founder of the first official union of Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island. \u201cPeople are really looking at us to be able to win this thing and use that momentum to get a contract,\u201d said Medelius. \u201cNot just a contract for us, but for everybody that is waiting for a contract from Amazon right now.\u201d",

            "content": "Back in December, Elon Musk led the charge to radically slim down government funding legislation, and stripped out a bunch of provisions, such as pharmaceutical reform, junk fee bans on ticketing and hotels, and deepfake porn protections. Since the news cycle moves so quickly, we\u2019ve mostly forgotten about what happened.\n\nBut this episode is worth remembering not only because of the substance, but also because Musk, for better or worse, has a lot of political power, and Trump said he\u2019s going to give him more of it. So how Musk operates, and the kinds of mistakes he makes along the way, matter. In this episode, there\u2019s one provision that Musk prevented from becoming law that I don\u2019t think was ever really reported, and that\u2019s legislation that would have prevented consumers from being able to buy a chemical, concentrated sodium nitrite, that is often used by teenagers to kill themselves. It\u2019s a shameful story, but one that could end well, if someone fixes this mistake.\n\nNow, first, I have to offer a caveat. There\u2019s a lot of anti-Musk sentiment out there, but I am not one of those people who reflexively dislikes Musk. His companies, as controversial and subsidized by the state as they are, do build rockets and electric cars instead of just monopolizing ad revenue, and some of the things he is doing in terms of government reform make sense. But he does make a lot of mistakes, and he does meddle in things in ways that are harmful without even knowing he\u2019s doing it. And I think it\u2019s important to point out what he\u2019s doing, as he does have political power.\n\nAnd with that, let\u2019s go back to late December. At the time, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson had cut a just-before-Christmas deal with Democrats and the Biden administration to fund the government. Since Mitch McConnell established a weird filibuster-heavy Congressional process twenty years ago, the only way to get bills passed is to attach legislation that has already been accepted by most legislators to a \u201cmust-pass\u201d bill, something which is \u201cshut the government down,\u201d war or debt-ceiling related.\n\nIn this case, Congress tossed a bunch of unrelated priorities into the government bill, almost all of which had gone through one or both Houses of Congress or were otherwise bipartisan supported consensus bills, but hadn\u2019t made it into law because of random procedural obstacles.\n\nAs this government funding legislation headed to the floor, Musk intervened. He argued the bill was too long and full of corrupt special interest-dealmaking, demanding it be slimmed down. Republicans in Congress in turn revolted against the Speaker, and Johnson reneged on the deal he had cut with Democrats, threatening a government shutdown before Christmas if the bill didn\u2019t have lots of stuff removed.\n\nSo it was. There were some provisions, like one that would have applied to Tesla\u2019s investments in China, that it seems like Musk knew about and had killed. But it\u2019s pretty clear that most of what was removed was done to just cut the length of the bill, almost randomly. For instance, one casualty was a bill to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, which are middlemen driving up the price of drugs. A few days after having the provision on PBMs removed, and feeling some heat over his actions, Musk tweeted the following:\n\nI don\u2019t know if he was being disingenuous, but this question suggests that Musk didn\u2019t want to appear to have killed that provision.\n\nAnother example of legislation that had been part of this funding bill is the Youth Poisoning Prevention Act, a wholly uncontroversial bill that was set to go into law in that big package, and had in fact already passed the House and a Senate committee. The Youth Poisoning Prevention Act outlaws the sale concentrated sodium nitrite, a commonly used chemical for teenage suicide. Sodium nitrite in low concentrations is a food preservative. In high concentrations, it has no household uses, and is lethal if ingested.\n\nThe rationale for the bill is simple. In 2021, the New York Times did an investigation showing that certain suicide-themed online forums were popularizing the use of concentrated sodium nitrite, which has no household uses, as an \u201ceasily accessible method to die by suicide.\u201d A 2021 toxicology publication based on data from the National Poison Data System showed that there was a rise in self-poisonings using sodium nitrite since 2017. This chemical could be bought on Amazon, the number one seller, as well as other online stores.\n\nWhen this dynamic came to light, most e-commerce vendors stopped selling it, but Amazon wouldn\u2019t until it faced public embarrassment and multiple lawsuits from families who lost their kids. It\u2019s actually more horrible than it seems at first glance, Amazon would not only sell this product, but its recommendation engine would apparently suggest other companion products to make it easier to commit suicide. Even now, it is still legal to sell this suicide aid to consumers, and I\u2019m told that though Amazon says the product is \"temporarily unavailable\" for regular accounts, it won\u2019t commit to ending its sale permanently.\n\nAs a result, four states have now banned the sale of concentrated sodium nitrite, and Rep. Lori Trahan sought to do it nationally. Her bill passed the House and a Senate committee. It was uncontroversial and was going to be included.\n\nBut the Youth Poisoning Prevention Act was on page 243-245 of the bill that had, according to Musk, just too many pages.\n\nSo it got stripped out. Musk did it without even knowing he did so. He probably still doesn\u2019t know.\n\nThat said, Musk isn\u2019t all powerful, so it\u2019s worth asking why no one stopped him. At the time, the Democrats controlled the Senate and the Presidency, so they had leverage. I asked a contact why Democrats agreed to Musk\u2019s hostage deal, and he told me that Democrats didn\u2019t think it was worth shutting the government down for a bunch of relatively small stuff that had bipartisan support and that would likely become law next Congress. Besides, Mike Johnson, who had lost credibility by offering the deal and then reneging on it after he couldn\u2019t bring his caucus along, wasn\u2019t likely to become Speaker again.\n\nWell Johnson did become Speaker again. Does that mean these priorities - pharmacy benefit reform, banning junk fees for hotels and ticketing, youth poison prevention - are dead? No. It would surprise me if most of them didn\u2019t come back, considering they all have strong bipartisan support. Still, Congress is a creature of inertia, and you do things because there\u2019s momentum. If you miss your moment, sometimes it never comes back.\n\nAt the time, removing these provisions was considered a simple mistake, something that would inevitably happen by people elected to shake things up. I\u2019m not opposed to aggressive action even if it produces mistakes, which are often fixable. But it\u2019s been a little over a month of the new administration, and this bill can once again move through Congress easily and without muss or fuss. So what happened to those priorities dropped by the wayside for the silly reason the bill was just too long?\n\nSo far, nothing. We can expect Trump and Musk, in breaking so much stuff while centralizing power, to make a bit of a mess. The question is, will anyone bother to clean it up?\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nAnd please send me tips on weird monopolies, stories I\u2019ve missed, or comments by clicking on the title of this newsletter.

(KWCH) - More industrial expansion is on its way to Salina with an anticipated addition of 100 jobs at a new Amazon facility.\n\nThe Salina Airport Authority announced Amazon\u2019s purchase of 20 acres to build an approximate 90,000-square-foot distribution facility in the 1800 block of West Water Well Road.\n\nThe Salina Airport Authority said the new facility \u201cwill serve as a critical component of Amazon\u2019s regional logistics network, further strengthening Salina\u2019s role as a major economic hub in Kansas.\u201d\n\nPlans call for the Amazon facility to anchor Salina\u2019s 80-acre industrial subdivision, currently undergoing infrastructure development.\n\n\u201cThe new facility will help power the last mile of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment process by enabling fast, everyday delivery directly to customers\u2019 doorstep,\u201d the airport authority explained. \u201cPackages are transported to delivery stations from Amazon fulfillment and sortation centers and then employees process customer packages for last-mile delivery, helping to speed up delivery for customers in more rural communities.\u201d\n\nWith the anticipated jobs, the airport authority said that Amazon employees in fulfillment and transportation earn at least $17 per hour.\n\nThe Industrial Center of which the Amazon facility will join is already home to more than 125 businesses employing more than 7,000 workers, the Salina Airport Authority said.\n\nThe airport authority sad these businesses contribute to \u201can annual Gross Regional Product (GRP) of $1.3 billion to the Kansas Economy,\u201d and that \u201cAmazon\u2019s presence will further enhance the region\u2019s growth, innovation and logistics capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting milestone for Salina and the entire state of Kansas,\u201d said Pieter Miller, C.M., Executive Director of the Salina Airport Authority in a news release announcing the Amazon expansion. \u201cAmazon\u2019s investment in our industrial center will not only create jobs but will also drive additional development, positioning Salina as a leading regional hub for logistics and advanced industries. The Salina Airport Authority Board of Directors has played a crucial role in guiding the strategic development of the Airport Industrial Center, ensuring that Salina remains a competitive and attractive location for businesses like Amazon.\u201d\n\nRecent industrial expansion in Salina has presented a challenge when it comes to housing for workers that jobs bring into town. Last month, 12 News reported on this issue and the approval of 250 additional units for a highly-anticipated housing development.\n\nYou can see further coverage on the planned housing expansion in the video above.\n\nCopyright 2025 KWCH.

            "content": "On February 9, Ecuador held presidential elections against the backdrop of a political, economic, security, and social crisis. Ecuadorians will head back to the polls on April 13 for a decisive runoff election that could drastically shape the health of the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n\nBoth current President Daniel Noboa and opposition candidate Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez have endorsed continued extractivism and oil drilling in the Amazon, weakened Indigenous territorial governance, and increased political persecution of their opponents.\n\nPresident Noboa, who obtained 44.6% of the votes, has led a term marked by militarization, an energy crisis, and human rights violations. Gonz\u00e1lez, representative of the political movement of former president Rafael Correa who obtained 44.02% of the vote, ran on a leftist-leaning platform to expand social policies, but also has a record of deepening extractivism, corruption, and persecution of her adversaries.\n\nYet, the Indigenous movement led by Leonidas Iza, the third political force in the country who obtained 5.24% of the vote, will be key to tipping the scales of the election. Iza has been one of the strongest opponents of extractivism and the policies of right-wing governments. Amid rampant state violence and the ongoing governmental failure to implement the Yasun\u00ed popular referendum, Indigenous and frontline organizing will only intensify, keeping the fight to End Amazon Crude and usher a new era of climate justice in the country alive.\n\nAmazon Watch has been supporting the fight to protect Yasun\u00ed National Park for decades. And we have won a lot of battles! Will you join us in this fight? We\u2019re in this for the long haul, and your support makes a difference. DONATE NOW\n\nNoboa\u2019s legacy: militarization, crisis, and repression\n\nDaniel Noboa assumed the presidency on November 23, 2023, after winning an extraordinary \u201ccrossed death\u201d election called by Guillermo Lasso, who thus avoided an impeachment trial for corruption.\n\nFrom the beginning of his term, Noboa faced an unprecedented security crisis, with Ecuador becoming one of the most violent countries in the hemisphere. In response, he decreed an internal armed conflict and launched Plan F\u00e9nix, a security policy based on the militarization of the country, prolonged states of emergency, and vastly increased security spending.\n\nDespite his \u201ciron fist\u201d policy, homicides have skyrocketed. This January was the bloodiest month in the country\u2019s history with 731 murders, almost double the 493 that were committed in January 2024.\n\nMost alarming has been the increase in human rights abuses, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. An emblematic case occurred in December 2024, when four Afro-descendant children, Josu\u00e9 Didier Arroyo Bustos, Ismael Arroyo Bustos, Steven Gerald Medina Lajones, and Nehem\u00edas Sa\u00fal Arboleda Portocarrero, were detained by the military and tragically found incinerated 25 miles from their homes.\n\nThe Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights denounced in its report, Forced Disappearances in the Context of Militarization in Ecuador that in 2024, 16 cases were registered on the Ecuadorian coast, with 27 disappeared victims, 9 of which are minors. These figures reveal an unprecedented escalation of state repression.\n\nThis security crisis was compounded by a serious energy crisis, resulting from a lack of investment in hydroelectric infrastructure and a prolonged drought. During 2024, Ecuador suffered multiple blackouts of up to 14 hours a day, affecting the economy with millions in losses.\n\nConsolidation of power and threat to Amazonian Indigenous rights\n\nDuring 2024, Daniel Noboa consolidated his alignment with the United States, securing security and trade agreements, in a context where the Ecuadorian government was seeking international financial support and political backing. In September 2024, Noboa presented an initiative to the Constitutional Court that would potentially allow the establishment of foreign military bases in Ecuadorian territory.\n\nAt the same time, in early February 2025, Noboa proposed another constitutional reform to eliminate the right to prior consultation (Art. 57) and the right to resistance (Art. 98). These measures would weaken the ability of Indigenous and campesino communities to resist extractive projects in their ancestral territories.\n\nThis announcement coincided with the finalization of negotiations for the signing of a Free Trade Agreement with Canada, a country whose companies own vast mining concessions in Ecuador, some of which are linked to the Noboa family. At the same time, his administration promoted its openness to new foreign mining investments, which are certain to escalate socio-environmental conflicts in Indigenous territories.\n\nThis scenario is compounded by an increase in illegal gold mining, which has become the most profitable criminal activity in the Ecuadorian Amazon. According to our latest report, Gold, Gangs and Governance: Indigenous Communities in the Grip of Organized Crime, criminal organizations have begun to reinvest drug trafficking profits in the illicit extraction of gold due to its high profitability and the ease with which it is traded on international markets. This dynamic has triggered a fierce struggle for territorial control, raising levels of violence, extortion, recruitment, and killings throughout the region.\n\nIn addition, the boom in illegal mining has facilitated the expansion of other illicit markets, such as the clandestine trafficking of mercury, arms, and drugs, which has strengthened criminal groups operating as protection forces within the mining enclaves. In this context, the combination of extractivist policies, institutional weakness, and the expansion of organized crime poses an unprecedented threat to Indigenous territorial governance and socio-environmental stability in the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n\nDoes Rafael Correa\u2019s legacy define Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez?\n\nThe candidacy of Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, from the Revoluci\u00f3n Ciudadana party, represents the continuity of Corre\u00edsmo, a movement that governed Ecuador between 2007 and 2017 under a model of massive public investment, expansion of social services, and strong state control over strategic sectors. Its administration was distinguished by a vertical exercise of power, a confrontational narrative, and deep social polarization.\n\nIn the beginning, Corre\u00edsmo aligned itself with the demands of social, Indigenous, and environmental movements, promoting an agenda that expanded basic services and infrastructure and reduced inequalities. However, over time, the party was marked by the promotion of extractivism and multiple conflicts and corruption scandals.\n\nAnother characteristic of Correa\u2019s government was the political persecution and criminalization of dissenting voices, which accentuated the fractures within Ecuadorian society. An emblematic case of his extractivist approach was the attempt to block the popular referendum on oil exploitation in Yasun\u00ed, which finally took place in 2023, almost a decade into his presidency.\n\nIn 2012, he granted the first large-scale mining contract to the Mirador project, an open-pit copper mine operated by the Chinese company Ecuacorrientes in the heart of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, despite complaints about the lack of consultation with Shuar Indigenous peoples and other communities in the area.\n\nCurrently, Corre\u00edsmo maintains solid popular support, especially in sectors that value its legacy of social investment. Recent electoral results show its resurgence, especially on the Ecuadorian coast. However, the movement faces the challenge of overcoming accusations of corruption and dispelling fears of a return to an authoritarian and polarizing model, which once restricted political pluralism and consolidated a power structure based on confrontation and centralization.\n\nThe Indigenous movement could tip the electoral scale\n\nDespite having obtained only 5.24% of the votes in the first round, Leonidas Iza and the Indigenous movement emerged as a key player in the definition of the next government. His leadership within the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador and his trajectory as one of the main opponents of neoliberal policies and extractivism position him as a leader of a growing social and political resistance.\n\nHistorically, the Indigenous movement has played a decisive role in the moments of greatest political tension in Ecuador, having been the protagonist of popular uprisings and mobilizations that have influenced the course of the country. The movement will continue to play a crucial role in the second round of elections, as its support base could tip the balance between Noboa and Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nThe challenge for the Indigenous movement lies in defining their strategy in a scenario where both candidates have supported extractivism, the use of public forces to quell social protest, and positions in opposition to Indigenous rights.\n\nWhile Noboa has prioritized militarization and the elimination of prior consultation, Corre\u00edsmo, despite having promoted social policies, has also supported an economic model based on the expansion of the oil and mining frontier.\n\nThis added to the challenge of confronting the expansion of organized crime and the mining that is expanding along the main rivers of the Ecuadorian Amazon, such as the Napo and Zamora, and the climate discussions that will be concentrated at COP 30 in Belem, Brazil in November of this year.\n\nThe dilemma for the Indigenous movement will be whether to adopt a position of neutrality, support one of the candidates under specific conditions, or promote the null vote as a message of rejection of the current political model. In any case, its capacity for mobilization and organization makes it a decisive factor in the outcome of these elections and the future of the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n\nPLEASE SHARE",

The new facilities, called \u201cinbound cross docks,\u201d launched operations earlier this month and are designed to receive cargo and sort merchandise to send to fulfillment centers, which handle customer orders.\n\nPaul Granillo, president and chief executive of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, said in a news release on Tuesday that the infusion of new jobs represented a \u201csignificant boost\u201d to the local economy.\n\nGranillo said in an interview that Inland Empire communities depend heavily on logistics jobs, since starting wages are typically higher than minimum wage. And the logistics sector was one of just three in the region that saw job growth in 2024, along with healthcare and government, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmazon is probably our largest private employer and is important to the economic vitality of the region,\u201d Granillo said.\n\nThe new Amazon jobs offer starting pay of $20.75 per hour and benefits such as healthcare, dental and vision coverage, a 401(k) with company match and up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, according to Amazon spokesperson Carly Levy.\n\nThe new positions will be added to Amazon\u2019s website in the coming weeks, she said.\n\nMichael McCarthy, an adjunct professor of environmental analysis at Pitzer College had a less rosy view of the region\u2019s freight and logistics sector. He said tariffs being pursued by the Trump administration don\u2019t bode well for Inland Empire warehousing. And, he said, growth in freighting has slowed in the years since the pandemic boost, with warehouses seeing higher job vacancy rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are overly dependent on warehousing. Devoting such a large share of our land use to it and not diversifying our economy is a problem,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe opening of new facilities comes amid tensions over environmental impacts of industrial development in the region. Developers have pursued properties along Inland Empire freeways, demolishing neighborhoods to make way for industrial facilities to convert the area into a logistics corridor for e-commerce arriving in Southern California ports. Community activists and residents have pushed for limits on this type of development, which they say drives pollution, traffic congestion and other problems.\n\nLast year Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a hotly contested bill that established new standards for building and design of industrial warehouses meant to protect the health of residents in surrounding areas. The legislation, which will go into effect in 2026, faced major opposition from those who saw it as a job killer, putting restraints on economic opportunity and infrastructure development.",

In May 2023, Ibama, the environmental regulator, rejected a license, citing issues such as a weak wildlife protection plan in the event of an oil spill that could affect one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse regions. State-owned oil company Petrobras appealed and a decision is pending.\n\n\u201cI want it (oil) to be explored. But before exploring, we need to research and see if there is oil and how much oil there is,\u201d Lula said Wednesday during an interview with radio station Diario. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stay in this endless chatter that drags and drags\u2014Ibama is a government agency, but it seems like it\u2019s working against the government.\u201d\n\nOffshore drilling near the Amazon would certainly draw scrutiny to Brazil, which is hosting the next United Nations climate summit, COP30. It\u2019s scheduled to take place in November in Belem, a port city located near the mouth of the Amazon, a few hundred miles from Bloc 59. A central push of the annual climate talks has been to reduce the use of fossil fuels such as oil, which when burned released greenhouse gas that heat up the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile both agendas, Lula said that the oil money would be used to finance clean energy projects. Brazil is a major oil-producing country, with an output roughly as big as Iraq, and is increasingly an exporter. On the other hand, about 90% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, primarily hydropower, according to government figures.\n\n\u201cWe will follow all the necessary procedures to ensure no harm to nature, but we can\u2019t ignore the wealth beneath us and choose not to explore it\u2014especially because this wealth will provide the funds for the much-needed and long-awaited energy transition,\u201d he said.\n\nExploring for new sources of oil near the Amazon just ahead COP30 will harm Brazil\u2019s image as a climate leader, said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of 133 environmental, civil society and academic groups.\n\n\u201cPresident Lula often says that Brazil should lead by example,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cExploring more oil is not a model action in the climate agenda.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "content": "City of Tucson Celebrates Amazon Flats Groundbreaking\n\nPublished on February 11, 2025\n\nThe City of Tucson\u2019s Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) held a groundbreaking ceremony at Amazon Flats, transforming the former Amazon Motel into permanent supportive housing units for very low-income households. When the City operated the motel as a shelter for 15 months, 140 people found temporary housing and 86 of those individuals moved into permanent housing. Permanent supportive housing bridges the gap between meeting people\u2019s immediate needs and fostering long-term well-being.\n\nLocated at 1135 W. Miracle Mile, the Amazon Flats includes adaptive reuse of the Amazon Motel in Phase 1, creating 30 studio apartments for permanent supportive housing. Phase 2, currently in pre-development includes construction of a new building with over 50 units of permanent supportive housing and is part of the Housing Plan in the City\u2019s Thrive in the \u201905 HUD Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant.\n\n\u201cThe success of the Amazon Motel and the Amazon Flats shows that our Housing First program is working and how the City of Tucson is investing millions in the future of housing stability,\u201d said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero. \u201cThe Amazon Flats will help us create more permanent supportive housing to help families find stability and change lives. Bringing projects like these to life is what we had in mind when this Mayor and Council passed the Housing Affordability Strategy for Tucson,\u201d said the Mayor. \u201cThank you to Governor Katie Hobbs and the Arizona Department of Housing for securing the resources to give cities like Tucson help people in our community impacted by the housing affordability crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Department of Housing (ADOH) awarded the City of Tucson a $6.1 million Hotels to Housing grant using American Recovery Plan Act funds allocated for state fiscal recovery. These grants were awarded to government and non-profit applicants able to meet rigorous project readiness criteria. The City of Tucson purchased the Amazon motel in April 2023 with these grant funds, and the remaining funds support Phase 1 property rehabilitation and construction. Pima County has also awarded the City of Tucson close to $750,000 in gap funding to support this project critical to our community.\n\nFollowing purchase of the former motel, the City\u2019s Housing First program operated it as a low-barrier shelter from June 2023 to September 2024 when site preparation for Amazon Flats Phase 1 began. Using the site as a low-barrier shelter during pre-development is a strategy that the City is using across multiple development projects; helping to meet the immediate need for shelter, while also planning for much-needed permanent supportive and affordable housing.\n\nAmazon Flats will be the second project developed by HCD\u2019s non-profit development arm, El Pueblo Housing Development (EPHD). EPHD and the City of Tucson have 9 projects in planning and development. Over 1,100 units of affordable housing are in planning or under construction, and 63 units have been completed with the recently opened Milagro on Oracle development north of Grant.\n\nHCD is partnering with Old Pueblo Community Services, a highly experienced non-profit agency which provides long-term support for persons who have experienced homelessness, including wrap-around services and case management, while the City\u2019s Housing First team will manage the property.\n\nThis new housing will be across the street from the soon-to-be completed Pima County Northwest Service Center, which was previously the old Golden Pin Lanes bowling alley. This service center will include a public health clinic and adult education services.\n\nThe development of Amazon Flats is a critical component of the City\u2019s Housing Affordability Strategy for Tucson (HAST) plan. One of the 10 points in the plan calls for enhanced efforts aimed at providing housing for Tucson\u2019s most vulnerable individuals.\n\nThe opening of Amazon Flats also demonstrates HCD\u2019s continuing focus on meeting Tucson\u2019s growing housing needs, said HCD Director Ann Chanecka. \u201cWith the creation of the City\u2019s non-profit El Pueblo Housing Development, HCD and the City of Tucson have more creative tools to address our housing crisis by constructing safe, affordable, and attractive residential units in powerful collaboration with the Arizona Department of Housing and our valuable private and non-profit partners,\u201d Chanecka said.",

Meta SAM 2.1 empowers organizations to achieve precise segmentation outcomes in vision-centric workflows with minimal configuration and maximum efficiency.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 offers multiple variants\u2014Tiny, Small, Base Plus, and Large\u2014available now on SageMaker JumpStart, balancing model size, speed, and segmentation performance to cater to diverse application needs.\n\nSageMaker JumpStart overview\n\nSageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch.\n\nWith SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. Models hosted on JumpStart can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia based instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune it using the extensive capabilities of SageMaker AI, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability. With SageMaker AI, you can streamline the entire model deployment process.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the following prerequisites to deploy Meta SAM 2.1 and run inference:\n\nAn AWS account that will contain all your AWS resources.\n\nAn AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to access SageMaker AI. To learn more about how IAM works with SageMaker AI, refer to Identity and Access Management for Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\nAccess to Amazon SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker notebook instance or an interactive development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. We recommend using SageMaker Studio for straightforward deployment and inference.\n\nAccess to accelerated instances (GPUs) for hosting the model.\n\nDiscover Meta SAM 2.1 in SageMaker JumpStart\n\nSageMaker JumpStart provides FMs through two primary interfaces: SageMaker Studio and the SageMaker Python SDK. This provides multiple options to discover and use hundreds of models for your specific use case.\n\nSageMaker Studio is a comprehensive IDE that offers a unified, web-based interface for performing all aspects of the machine learning (ML) development lifecycle. From preparing data to building, training, and deploying models, SageMaker Studio provides purpose-built tools to streamline the entire process. In SageMaker Studio, you can access SageMaker JumpStart to discover and explore the extensive catalog of FMs available for deployment to inference capabilities on SageMaker Inference.\n\nYou can access the SageMaker JumpStart UI through either Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio or SageMaker Studio. To deploy Meta SAM 2.1 using the SageMaker JumpStart UI, complete the following steps:\n\nIn SageMaker Unified Studio, on the Build menu, choose JumpStart models.\n\nIf you\u2019re already on the SageMaker Studio console, choose JumpStart in the navigation pane.\n\nYou will be prompted to create a project, after which you can begin deployment.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the SageMaker Python SDK to programmatically access and use SageMaker JumpStart models. This approach allows for greater flexibility and integration with existing AI/ML workflows and pipelines. By providing multiple access points, SageMaker JumpStart helps you seamlessly incorporate pre-trained models into your AI/ML development efforts, regardless of your preferred interface or workflow.\n\nDeploy Meta SAM 2.1 for inference using SageMaker JumpStart\n\nOn the SageMaker JumpStart landing page, you can discover the public pre-trained models offered by SageMaker AI. You can choose the Meta model provider tab to discover the Meta models available.\n\nIf you\u2019re using SageMaker Studio and don\u2019t see the SAM 2.1 models, update your SageMaker Studio version by shutting down and restarting. For more information about version updates, refer to Shut down and Update Studio Classic Apps.\n\nYou can choose the model card to view details about the model such as license, data used to train, and how to use. You can also find two buttons, Deploy and Open Notebook, which help you use the model.\n\nWhen you choose Deploy, you should be prompted to the next screen to choose an endpoint name and instance type to initiate deployment.\n\nUpon defining your endpoint settings, you can proceed to the next step to use the model.\n\nDeploy Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model for inference using the Python SDK\n\nWhen you choose Deploy, model deployment will start. Alternatively, you can deploy through the example notebook by choosing Open Notebook. The notebook provides end-to-end guidance on how to deploy the model for inference and clean up resources.\n\nTo deploy using a notebook, you start by selecting an appropriate model, specified by the model_id . You can deploy any of the selected models on SageMaker AI.\n\nYou can deploy a Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model using SageMaker JumpStart with the following SageMaker Python SDK code:\n\nfrom sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel model = JumpStartModel(model_id = \"meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tiny\") predictor = model.deploy()\n\nThis deploys the model on SageMaker AI with default configurations, including default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. After it\u2019s deployed, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. There are three tasks that are available with this endpoint: automatic mask generator, image predictor, and video predictor. We provide a code snippet for each later in this post. To use the predictor, a certain payload schema needs to be followed. The endpoint has sticky sessions enabled, so to start inference, you need to send a start_session payload:\n\ndef start_session(asset_type, asset_path): asset_base64 = None with open(image_path, 'rb') as f: asset_base64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('utf-8') response = predictor.invoke_endpoint( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"start_session\", \"input_type\": asset_type, \"path\": asset_base64 }), SessionId=\"NEW_SESSION\", ) session_id = response.headers.get(\"x-amzn-sagemaker-new-session-id\") return session_id\n\nThe start_session invocation needs an input media type of either image or video and the base64 encoded data of the media. This will launch a session with an instance of the model and load the media to be segmented.\n\nTo close a session, send a close_session invocation:\n\ndef close_session(session_id): response = predictor.invoke_endpoint( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"close_session\", \"session_id\": session_id }), SessionId=session_id, ) session_id = response.headers.get(\"x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id\") return session_id\n\nIf x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id exists as a header, then the session has been successfully closed.\n\nTo continue a session and retrieve the session ID of the existing session, the response header will have the x-amzn-sagemaker-session-id key with the current session ID for any operation that is not start_session or close_session . Operations that aren\u2019t start_session or close_session need to be invoked with a response stream. This is due to the size of the resulting payload being larger than what SageMaker real-time endpoints can return.\n\nThis is a basic example of interacting with the SAM 2.1 SageMaker JumpStart endpoint with sticky sessions. The following examples for each of the tasks reference these operations without repeating them. The returned data is of mime type JSONL. For more complete examples, refer to the example notebooks for Meta SAM 2.1 on SageMaker Jumpstart.\n\nRecommended instances and benchmarks\n\nThe following table lists all the Meta SAM 2.1 models available in SageMaker JumpStart along with the model_id , default instance types, and maximum number of total tokens (sum of number of input tokens and number of generated tokens) supported for each of these models. For increased context length, you can modify the default instance type in the SageMaker JumpStart UI.\n\nModel Name Model ID Default Instance Type Supported Instance Types Meta SAM 2.1 Tiny meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tiny ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Small meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-small ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Base Plus meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-base-plus ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Large meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-large ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 use cases: Inference and prompt examples\n\nAfter you deploy the model using SageMaker JumpStart, you should be able to see a reference Jupyter notebook that references the parser and helper functions needed to begin using Meta SAM 2.1. After you follow those cells in the notebook, you should be ready to begin using the model\u2019s vision segmentation capabilities.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 offers support for three different tasks (automatic mask generator, image predictor, video predictor) to generate masks for various objects in images, including object tracking in videos. In the following examples, we demonstrate how to use the automatic mask generator and image predictor on a JPG of a truck. This truck.jpg file is stored in the jumpstart-cache-prod bucket; you can access it with the following code:\n\ns3_bucket = f\"jumpstart-cache-prod-{region}\" key_prefix = \"inference-notebook-assets\" def download_from_s3(key_filenames): for key_filename in key_filenames: s3.download_file(s3_bucket, f\"{key_prefix}/{key_filename}\", key_filename) truck_jpg = \"truck.jpg\" #Download images. download_from_s3(key_filenames=[truck_jpg]) display(Image(filename=truck_jpg))\n\nAfter you have your image and it is encoded, you can create masks for objects in the image. For use cases where you want to generate masks for every object in the image, you can use the automatic mask generator task.\n\nAutomatic mask generator\n\nThe automatic mask generator is great for AI researchers for computer vision tasks and applications such as medical imaging and diagnostics to automatically segment regions of interest like tumors or specific organs to provide more accurate diagnostic support. Additionally, the automatic mask generator can be particularly useful in the autonomous vehicle space, in which it can segment out elements in a camera like pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects. Let\u2019s use the automatic mask generator to generate masks for all the objects in truck.jpg .\n\nThe following code is the prompt to generate masks for your base64 encoded image:\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"image\", truck_jpg) # Generate and visualize masks with basic parameters response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"generate_automatic_masks\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"points_per_side\": 32, \"min_mask_region_area\": 100 }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nImage predictor\n\nAdditionally, you can choose which objects in the provided image you want to create a mask for by adding points within that object for Meta SAM 2.1 to create. A use case for the image predictor can be valuable for tasks related to design and modeling by automating processes that typically require manual efforts. For example, the image predictor can automate turning 2D images into 3D models by analyzing 2D images of blueprints, sketches, or floor plans and generating preliminary 3D models. This is one of many examples of how the image predictor can act as a bridge between 2D and 3D construction across many different tasks. We use the following image with the points that we used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for masking the object.\n\nThe following code is used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 and plot the coordinates:\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"image\", truck_jpg) points = [ {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [500, 375], \"label\": 1}, {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1125, 625], \"label\": 1} ] # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"points\": [p[\"coordinates\"] for p in points], \"labels\": [p[\"label\"] for p in points], \"clear_old_points\": clear_old_point, }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"predict\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"multimask_output\": True, \"return_logits\": True }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nVideo predictor\n\nWe now demonstrate how to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for object tracking on video. One use case would be for ergonomic data collection and training purposes. You can use the video predictor to analyze the movement and posture of humans in real time, serving as a way to reduce injury and improve performance by setting alarms for bad posture or movements. Let\u2019s start by accessing the basketball-layup.mp4 file [1] from the jumpstart-cache-prod S3 bucket defined in the following code:\n\nbasketball_mp4 = \"basketball-layup.mp4\" #Download video download_from_s3(key_filenames=[basketball_mp4]) display(Video(filename=basketball_mp4))\n\nVideo:\n\nThe following code shows how you can set up the prompt format to track objects in the video. The first object will use coordinates to track and not track, and the second object will track one coordinate.\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"video\", basketball_mp4) # Object 1 prompts1 = [ {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1478, 649], \"label\": 1}, {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1433, 689], \"label\": 0}, ] # Extract points and labels points = [] labels = [] for prompt in prompts1: if prompt[\"type\"] == \"point\": points.append(prompt[\"coordinates\"]) labels.append(prompt[\"label\"]) request = { \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"frame_index\": 0, \"object_id\": 1, \"points\": points, \"labels\": labels, \"clear_old_points\": True, } # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps(request), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() # Object 2 prompts2 = [{\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1433, 689], \"label\": 1}] # Extract points and labels points = [] labels = [] for prompt in prompts2: if prompt[\"type\"] == \"point\": points.append(prompt[\"coordinates\"]) labels.append(prompt[\"label\"]) request = { \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"frame_index\": 0, \"object_id\": 2, \"points\": points, \"labels\": labels, \"clear_old_points\": True, } # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps(request), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"propagate_in_video\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"start_frame_index\": 0, }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nVideo:\n\nHere we can see that Meta SAM 2.1 Tiny was able to successfully track the objects based off the coordinates that were provided in prompt.\n\nClean up\n\nTo avoid incurring unnecessary costs, when you\u2019re done, delete the SageMaker AI endpoints using the following code:\n\npredictor.delete_model() predictor.delete_endpoint()\n\nAlternatively, to use the SageMaker AI console, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the SageMaker AI console, under Inference in the navigation pane, choose Search for the embedding and text generation endpoints. On the endpoint details page, choose Delete. Choose Delete again to confirm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including Meta\u2019s most advanced and capable models to date.

This will be the first launch for the ULA rocket this year.\n\nULA had expected the launch slot to handle to be the USSF-106 mission onboard a Vulcan rocket and it began preparing the rocket in October 2024, following its second certification mission, dubbed Cert-2. Gary Wentz, vice president of Government and Commercial Programs at ULA said the government identified that payload as \u201ctheir highest priority mission,\u201d so they worked to get quickly ready for that.\n\nHowever, the USSF-106 mission is not yet ready. \u201cAnd so, we elected to go ahead and LVOS (Launch Vehicle on Stand) pause that booster to get that work off the critical path so that we\u2019re prepared to launch, whether it was 106 or Kuiper,\u201d added Wentz.\n\nIt seems Kuiper has won the race, and the rocket will handle a large number of satellites, possibly around 27 although the precise number has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t said how many satellites it plans to launch on the Kuiper-1 mission although it has announced on social media that \u201canother batch\u201d of its Kuiper broadband production satellites was \u201con its way to Cape Canaveral.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s Kuiper fleet is planned to have a total of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit.

They are using captive audience meetings (the kind that was ruled unlawful in November, but which the NLRB no longer has the quorum to enforce) to divide us by race. For example, they\u2019ll pick out a group of Hispanic workers and tell them that the Black union members just don\u2019t want to work as hard, and that\u2019s why they want a union. This union busting is disgusting.\n\nAmazon is pulling out all the stops because they are scared. They saw us in the streets before Christmas. They saw our comrades at Whole Foods pull off a win last month. Amazon knows that if we can win a union in North Carolina, we can win anywhere. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going overboard to try to stop us.\n\nOur union doesn\u2019t want to shut down Amazon. We want the public to see the way Amazon exploits and dehumanizes people instead of treating them with dignity. The way Amazon treats us is not the only way to get packages to you in two days or less.\n\nJeff Bezos is the second richest man in the world. He has said \u201cThe only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s got his eyes on space, we\u2019re fighting for a liveable wage, and for adequate staffing so that no one loses a limb for two day shipping. It\u2019s not too much to ask.\n\nAmazon has played dirty the whole time. They believe that they have enough money and power to break labor laws and fire union organizers without drawbacks. But we\u2019re going to show them that all the money in the world doesn\u2019t mean anything if they don\u2019t have the people. And we\u2019re seeing record-breaking attendance at our membership meetings in the run up to this election. Everything I\u2019m seeing shows that Amazon\u2019s union-busting is backfiring, and driving people to vote yes.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out after the voting. Until then, I\u2019ll keep organizing.\n\nIf you want to support CAUSE in the election, donate to The Labor Force, a 501(c)4 that is providing resources to CAUSE.",

            "content": "We are well settled into 2025 by now, but many people are still catching up with all the exciting new releases and announcements that came out of re:Invent last year. There have been hundreds of re:Invent recap events around the world since the beginning of the year, including in-person all-day official AWS events with multiple tracks to help you discover and dive deeper into the releases you care about, as well as community and virtual events.\n\nLast month, I was lucky to be a co-host for AWS EMEA re:Invent re:Cap which was a nearly 4-hour livestream with experts featuring demos, whiteboard sessions, and a live Q&A. The good news is that you can now watch it on-demand! We had a great team and thousands of people enjoyed learning through the virtual experience. I recommend you check it out or share it with colleagues who have not been able to attend any re:Invent re:Cap events.\n\nThe Korean team also did an amazing job hosting their own virtual re:Invent re:Cap event, and it\u2019s also now available on-demand. So if you speak Korean I do recommend you check it out.\n\nIf you\u2019re more of a reader, then we have a treat for you. You can download the full official re:Invent re:Cap deck with all the slides covering releases across all areas by visiting community.aws! While there, you can also check all the upcoming in-person re:Invent re:Cap community events remaining across the globe for a chance to still attend one of those in a city near you.\n\nBut as we know, new releases, announcements, and updates don\u2019t stop at re:Invent. Every week there are even more, and this is why we have this Weekly Roundup series that you can read every Monday to get the AWS news highlights from the week before.\n\nSo here\u2019s what caught my attention last week.\n\nLast week\u2019s AWS Launches\n\nIf you use AWS Step Functions you may be interested in these:\n\nNew data source and output options for Distributed Maps \u2013 Distributed Maps area a great fit for large-scale parallel document processing. Now, in addition to the already existing support for JSON and CSV files, it can process JSONL, as well as semicolon or tab-delimited files. You can also use new output transformations such as FLATTEN to combine result sets without any additional code.\n\nDefault quota increased to 100,000 state machines and activities per AWS account \u2013 the previous default quota for the number of registered state machines and activities per AWS account was 10,000, making this a 10x increase.\n\nAmazon Q Developer also got a couple of updates:\n\nHere are some other releases that caught my attention this week from a variety of other AWS services:\n\nAWS CloudFormation introduces stack refactoring \u2013 You can now split your CloudFormation stacks, move resources from one stack to another, and change the logical name of resources within the same stack. This adds a lot of flexibility enabling you to keep up with changes within your organization and architectures, such as streamlining resource lifecycle management for existing stacks, keeping up with naming convention changes, and other cases. You can refactor your stacks by using the AWS command line interface (CLI) or AWS SDK.\n\nAWS Config now supports 4 new release types \u2013 AWS Config is great for monitoring resources across your AWS environment and help you towards ensuring alignment with your company and security policies as well as compliance requirements. It now has four new types of resources enabling you to monitor Amazon VPC block public access settings, any exceptions made within those settings, as well as monitor S3 Express One Zone bucket policies and directory bucket settings.\n\nAutomated recovery of Microsoft SQL Server on EC2 instan ces with VSS \u2013 You can now use a new feature called Volume Shadow Copy Services (VSS) to backup Microsoft SQL Server databases to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots while the database is running. You can then use AWS Systems Manager Automation Runbook to set a recovery point of time of your preference and it will restore the database automatically from your VSS-based EBS snapshot without incurring any downtime.\n\nFor a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What\u2019s New with AWS page.\n\nOther updates\n\nUpcoming changes to the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) global endpoint \u2013 To help improve the resiliency and performance of your applications, we are making changes to the AWS STS global endpoint (https://sts.amazonaws.com), with no action required from customers. Starting in early 2025, requests to the STS global endpoint will be automatically served in the same Region as your AWS deployed workloads. For example, if your application calls sts.amazonaws.com from the US West (Oregon) Region, your calls will be served locally in the US West (Oregon) Region instead of being served by the US East (N. Virginia) Region. These changes will be released in the coming weeks and we will gradually roll it out to AWS Regions that are enabled by default by mid-2025.\n\nLooking for some reading recommendations? At the beginning of every year Dr. Werner Vogles, VP and CTO of Amazon, publishes a list of recommended books that he believes should have your attention. This year\u2019s list is looking particularly good in my opinion!\n\nUpcoming AWS and community events\n\nAWS Public Sector Day London, February 27 \u2014 Join public sector leaders and innovators to explore how AWS is enabling digital transformation in government, education, and healthcare.\n\nAWS Innovate GenAI + Data Edition \u2014 A free online conference focusing on generative AI and data innovations. Available in multiple Regions: APJC and EMEA (March 6), North America (March 13), Greater China Region (March 14), and Latin America (April 8).\n\nBrowse more upcoming AWS led in-person and virtual developer-focused events.\n\nThat\u2019s it for this week!

            "content": "Amazon workers in Garner to vote on unionizing\n\nGARNER, N.C. -- North Carolina is a state that is generally hostile to unions. Amazon is a company that is, historically, extremely hostile to unions. Now an upstart union is attempting to represent more than 4,000 Amazon workers at one of the online retailer's facilities there.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board is overseeing a six-day vote starting Monday, with votes due to be counted Saturday. A win by the union, Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, in the town of Garner would be just the second Amazon facility to see a union win a representation vote, following a 2022 election at one of the company's major sorting and distribution centers in Staten Island, New York.\n\nAmazon, the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, has faced increasing pressure from unions in recent months. And despite the fact that North Carolina has the lowest percentage of union membership among workers of any state - only 2.4% of workers overall, which is less than one-quarter of the national average - leaders of the union's efforts said that they are confident about the outcome of the vote.\n\n\"As you imagine Amazon has been doing everything to make sure we don't win,\" Italo Medelius-Marsano, an Amazon worker and one of the leaders of the campaign, told CNN. \"The amount of money that Amazon is pouring into this, the people they're flying in to take us on, the propaganda - all of that tells us they're scared. That fear tells us that they know we're on the verge of something great.\"\n\nThe company said that it is confident that workers in Garner, a town of 35,000 just outside of Raleigh, want to keep the sorting and distribution warehouse union-free.\n\n\"We believe our employees favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team,\" said a statement from Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards. \"The fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits.\"\n\nThe company said it pays workers in the facility a starting wage of $18.50 an hour and a top pay of $23.80 an hour. The union organizers said they'll be pressing for $30 an hour.\n\n\"I would challenge anyone to say $20 an hour is a livable wage here,\" said Medelius-Marsano. \"In the Raleigh area, that's a slap in the face. Given the profits at Amazon and what it's worth, $30 an hour is incredibly reasonable.\"\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $2.4 trillion and made $59 billion in net income in 2024, nearly double what it made the year before.\n\nTo become official, they need a majority vote but some workers like Cheryl Massingale, who's worked at the facility for four years, are voting no. She said it's not worth risking what they already have.\n\n\"We probably will get a raise but it will not be $30 an hour that's just not realistic here,\" Massingale said. \"I'm sorry but if you want $30 an hour you should go work somewhere else.\"\n\nSupporters are looking to their friends up north for a road to success. Members of the first Amazon facility to unionize in Staten Island New York joined them at their rally.\n\n\"It takes a lot of organizing, a lot of organizing a lot of persistence you're gonna get discouraged but you keep going,\" New York Amazon Union Leader Miss Mena said.\n\nBut they said one challenge is New York's laws are much more pro-union than North Carolina's.\n\n\"I know that the south is harder because of the right-to-work state, the laws are different here but you know the south is resilient, the people down here are resilient and the energy is high,\" said New York Amazon Union Leader, Chris Smalls.\n\nAmazon's history of fighting union efforts\n\nBut even if the union wins, it could take years to negotiate a first contract. Amazon has continued to challenge the union representation vote it lost at the Staten Island facility in court, nearly three years after the NLRB certified the vote results. And it has refused to negotiate with the Amazon Labor Union, the upstart union that won the vote, or the Teamsters union, with which ALU members voted to affiliate last year.\n\n\"As we have shared before, we strongly disagree with the outcome of the election at (Staten Island),\" said Hards. \"Both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome and that is why we don't believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.\" The official total showed that 55% of the workers who voted supported the union.\n\nOrganizers in Garner said they have gotten support from other unions that are trying to organize other Amazon facilities and that it has learned from past union defeats at the company. Amazon has defeated union organizing votes twice at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama, as well as at a second Staten Island facility next to the one that voted for the union, as well as one just outside of Albany, New York.\n\nBut the organizers in North Carolina said the fact that theirs is an independent union is an advantage.\n\n\"Amazon paints us as an outside group,\" said Ryan Brown, a union organizer who was fired by Amazon in December, after five years at the company. \"But the workers here know we're not outsiders. Those of us who have lived in the South all of our lives know our culture, which is that we're skeptical of strangers, of outsiders.\"\n\nBrown and the union claim that his firing was due to his union activity. The company denies this, saying it was due to \"repeated and well-documented incidents of misconduct.\"\n\nBut despite Amazon trying to hold back union representation, it has been facing greater pressure than ever before from union efforts.\n\nUnions stepping up efforts at Amazon\n\nWorkers at Whole Foods in Philadelphia just became the first at the Amazon-owned grocery chain to vote for a union.\n\nAnd the Teamsters announced a six-day strike just before Christmas.\n\nIn addition to the workers in Staten Island, that strike primarily involved drivers who deliver packages for Amazon exclusively but who the company argues are not its employees, because they officially work for \"independent contractors.\"\n\nCAUSE filed complaints of unfair labor practices against Amazon on Thursday, which is not unusual, as the company already has multiple such complaints filed against it with the NLRB. The labor agency staff and administrative law judges have found against Amazon in numerous cases.\n\nOne of those judges issued a decision finding substantiated unfair labor practice allegations against Amazon, requiring the court to set aside the 2022 rerun election in Alabama and ordering a third election there. But before that can happen that case needs to be considered by the agency's full board, and upon taking office, President Donald Trump fired a sitting NLRB board member for the first time in history, which means there is no longer the quorum necessary to hear such cases. The fired board member is challenging her dismissal in court.\n\nSo even if a union is to win the vote, it will face an uphill battle to win the contract it says its members deserve, given Amazon's track record fighting unionization efforts in the rest of the country. The union leaders said they're ready for that.\n\n\"When you look at the civil rights movement, it was years and years to get the justice some Americans weren't getting,\" said Brown. \"I am committed to this fight for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"The workers want Amazon to recognize their humanity and not treat them like a robot,\" said Medelius-Marsano. \"Our cheap labor has helped produce so much wealth. But they won't even meet us halfway.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire & ABC11's Tom George contributed to this report",

Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb announced Friday.\n\nAccording to Schwalb, Amazon misled consumers in Washington, D.C., between 2016 and 2019 by assuring them that all the tips they provided would go to Amazon\u2019s Flex drivers, employees who deliver packages with their own cars.\n\nSchwalb's office alleged that by diverting millions of dollars in tips, Amazon was able to save on its own operating costs and therefore increase profits.\n\n\"When companies mislead customers to boost their profits by stealing tips intended for their workers, they are cheating their consumers, their employees, and their competitors who play by the rules,\" Schwalb said.\n\nAMAZON SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY STEALING MORE THAN $1M IN TIPS FROM DELIVERY WORKERS\n\nAmazon said in a statement to Fox News Digital that the company disagrees with the allegations, noting that Amazon Flex has evolved since then.\n\n\"For nearly a decade, Amazon Flex has empowered delivery partners to earn extra money on their own schedules,\" Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said. \"Like any successful program, Amazon Flex has evolved over time, and this lawsuit relates to a practice we changed more than five years ago. While we continue to disagree with these allegations, we\u2019re happy to have the matter behind us so we can continue to focus on supporting delivery partners and customers.\"\n\n140,000 AMAZON DRIVERS WILL GET BACK $60M IN ALLEGEDLY WITHHELD TIPS\n\nWhen Amazon Flex launched in 2015, consumers were able to tip their delivery drivers at checkout, which stated that 100% of the tips would go to the drivers.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that Amazon changed its driver payment model the following year, and that instead of allowing the tips to increase the driver\u2019s total compensation, the company used it to cover the employees\u2019 base wages Amazon had already promised to pay the drivers.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, the payment model change was not disclosed to the drivers or the consumers, allowing the model to continue taking tips until 2019, when Amazon became \"aware of the FTC\u2019s investigation in 2019.\"\n\nThe company was accused of stealing more than $1 million in tips to cover its labor expenses.\n\nAs part of a settlement with the FTC in 2021, all the customer tips at issue were eventually paid to the drivers, according to an Amazon spokesperson at that time.\n\nAside from the restitution-only settlement with the FTC, the attorney general\u2019s office filed a lawsuit for injunctive relief and civil penalties, noting that additional penalties were warranted to disincentivize unlawful behavior.\n\n\"It\u2019s not sufficient, after being caught, to simply give back the ill-gotten gains,\" Schwalb said. \"Rather, there must be meaningful consequences to deter misconduct from happening in the first place. Especially when living expenses are harder and harder to afford, my office will continue to ensure that hardworking District residents receive every penny of their earnings and consumers have confidence that they are not being misled.\"\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % AMZN AMAZON.COM INC. 216.58 -6.30 -2.83%\n\nAccording to the settlement, Amazon has denied all the allegations and claims.\n\n\"Amazon maintains that it made truthful, complete, unambiguous, and accurate representations to customers regarding tips for drivers,\" the settlement stated.\n\nAccording to the settlement terms, Amazon will pay $3.95 million, including $2.45 million in penalties and $1.5 million in costs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe company has also agreed to maintain transparent tipping practices.\n\n\"If Amazon uses tips for any purpose other than increasing driver compensation, the company must make clear disclosures about how tips are used on both its website and its app,\" the settlement stated.\n\nFox News' Daniella Genovese contributed to this report.",

            "content": "In January, Chinese start-up DeepSeek introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that quickly became the most downloaded free mobile application in the U.S. Importantly, the base large language model behind the DeepSeek application allegedly cost $6 million to train and reportedly outperforms top U.S. models on certain benchmarks.\n\nThat shook Wall Street because OpenAI spent over $100 million training its GPT-4 model and supposedly had access to more advanced chips than DeepSeek. Investors rushed to the conclusion that U.S. companies have been overspending on AI infrastructure, and Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%) shares fell 17% on the news, erasing $600 billion in market value. That is the largest single-day loss in U.S. history.\n\nNvidia shares are still down by about 9% since DeepSeek rattled the market, and the stock is currently 13% off its all-time high. But Nvidia shareholders just got some good news from Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) and Alphabet (GOOGL -2.65%). Read on to learn more.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are skeptical about the DeepSeek narrative\n\nMany analysts have praised DeepSeek for its engineering breakthroughs. The company reduced expenses by cutting down on data processing with innovative training techniques. However, several analysts also question whether DeepSeek has been completely forthcoming about its infrastructure and the associated costs.\n\nFor instance, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities wrote, \"Saying DeepSeek was built for $6 million with no Nvidia next generation hardware is likely a fictional story.\" Likewise, research company SemiAnalysis reports that DeepSeek not only had next-generation Nvidia GPUs but also incurred about $1.6 billion in expenses while training its model.\n\nImportantly, cost efficiencies could actually boost demand for Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) by enabling faster diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) through the economy. Put differently, if novel training methods reduce model development costs, more software companies will build AI products, increasing the total demand for Nvidia GPUs.\n\nAmazon and Google plan to invest even more aggressively in AI infrastructure\n\nLast week, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet reported fourth-quarter financial results. Both companies said capital expenditures would increase substantially in 2025, as they are currently supply-constrained where AI infrastructure is concerned.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy predicted costs associated with developing AI models will continue to fall. But he also said, \"I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI.\" And CFO Brian Olsavsky told analysts that capital spend may exceed $100 billion in 2025, up from $83 billion in 2024, due to demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai provided similar insights. He said a greater percentage of capital expenses are shifting toward inference as training becomes less expensive, implying DeepSeek's breakthroughs would not slow AI spending. Indeed, CFO Ana Ashkenazi told analysts that capital expenditures would total $75 billion in 2025, up from $52 billion in 2024, due primarily to investments in data centers, servers, and networking.\n\nThe capital spending guidance from Amazon and Google parent Alphabet corroborates the narrative that demand for Nvidia GPUs could actually increase as training costs decline because companies will shift their resources toward inference. Andy Jassy compared the situation to how cloud computing sales have actually increased over time despite cloud services becoming less expensive.\n\n\"What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses. But then they get excited about what else they could build that was always cost-prohibitive before, and they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per unit cost less. I think that is very much what's going to happen here in AI.\"\n\nWall Street still expects Nvidia's earnings to grow very quickly\n\nWall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will grow at 52% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026. That consensus makes the current valuation of 50 times adjusted earnings look cheap. Admittedly, analysts have set a very high bar, so the stock could fall sharply if Nvidia misses those expectations.\n\nHere is the bottom line: Nvidia shareholders worried about the DeepSeek drama can take a deep breath. Many analysts think more efficient AI training techniques will lead to greater demand for Nvidia GPUs. And evidence from the largest hyperscale cloud companies supports that conclusion.",

Amazon sent out media invites for a Feb. 26 event in New York City, and Amazon's Devices and Services team lead Panos Panay is scheduled to speak.\n\nPanay joined Amazon in 2023 after spending decades at Microsoft, where he helped shape the Surface product line.\n\nThe event is expected to preview Alexa's long-rumored generative AI voice capabilities, which could significantly enhance its ability to engage in more natural, contextual conversations and complete multistep tasks.\n\nIf announced, this would mark Alexa's most significant evolution since its debut in 2014. Although Amazon has long been a leader in the AI assistant space, the landscape is rapidly shifting. Companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are rolling out increasingly sophisticated AI assistants capable of multitasking and completing complex requests.\n\nAlexa currently processes one command at a time. Last month, OpenAI introduced a new AI agent called Operator, which aims to handle everyday tasks like making dinner reservations, ordering groceries and filling out forms. Amazon told CNET that the event will highlight the latest innovations from the Alexa team but did not provide further details.\n\nWith more than half a billion Alexa-enabled devices in homes worldwide, a generative AI upgrade could reshape how users interact with voice assistants, and potentially introduce a paid tier for more advanced capabilities. Reuters reported that Amazon has considered charging between $5 and $10 per month for the service, while keeping the original version of Alexa free.\n\nApple is also rumored to ramp up its smart home efforts with a Siri-powered, wall-mounted display designed to control household devices such as thermostats, lights and appliances.\n\nPredicted to launch in March, the device is expected to be part of Apple's push to compete more aggressively in the smart home market, where it has historically trailed Google and Amazon.",

Some of these companies were prominent in the past but have been largely forgotten, while others are relatively invisible, making steady gains that often go unnoticed.\n\nAccording to Cramer, these stocks represent a sharp contrast to the giant, high-profile names that dominate everyday conversations about the market. He remarked that on a day when the Dow dropped by 126 points, the S&P rose by 0.36%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.51%, it was worth taking a closer look at the stocks driving the Dow higher, as this index is composed of some of the most established companies that, despite their storied histories, do not typically get the media attention they deserve. Cramer concluded by stating that the performance of these quieter, non-tech stocks so far this year has been significant.\n\n\u201cBottom line: So far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 6.

Schwalb said Friday.\n\nThe settlement came four years after Amazon forked over $61.7 million to resolve a complaint the Federal Trade Commission brought over similar accusations.\n\nIn 2022, the office of DC\u2019s attorney general at the time followed up with a lawsuit alleging Amazon violated the District\u2019s consumer protection laws by misleading residents about how tips paid digitally were used.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the affected drivers were part of Amazon\u2019s Flex business, which allows people to deliver Amazon packages with their own cars.\n\nDC\u2019s lawsuit said that after launching the program in 2015, the company represented to consumers that all tips added during check-out for Amazon Flex orders would go to drivers.\n\nBut both the District and the FTC alleged that Amazon changed its payment model in late 2016 to lower its costs but did not disclose the switch to either customers or drivers.\n\nIn particular, the FTC\u2019s previous complaint alleged the company algorithmically reduced its own wages for drivers in different locations using data it collected about average tips in a specific area. Amazon then used the tips to make up the difference between its new base pay and the $18-25 per hour it had promised drivers, the complaint said.\n\nThe FTC said Amazon didn\u2019t stop taking the tips until 2019, when the company found out about the agency\u2019s investigation into the issue.\n\nAmazon has denied the allegations and did not admit to wrongdoing as part of the settlement announced Friday.\n\n\u201cLike any successful program, Amazon Flex has evolved over time, and this lawsuit relates to a practice we changed more than five years ago,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the company will pay $2.45 million in penalties plus $1.5 million in legal fees. It must also disclose on its website and app how tips impact driver earnings.\n\nBy The Associated Press",

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nNorth Carolina is a state that is generally hostile to unions. Amazon is a company that is, historically, extremely hostile to unions. Now an upstart union is attempting to represent more than 4,000 Amazon workers at one of the online retailer\u2019s facilities there.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board is overseeing a six-day vote starting Monday, with votes due to be counted Saturday. A win by the union, Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, in the town of Garner would be just the second Amazon facility to see a union win a representation vote, following a 2022 election at one of the company\u2019s major sorting and distribution centers in Staten Island, New York.\n\nAmazon, the nation\u2019s second largest private sector employer, has faced increasing pressure from unions in recent months. And despite the fact that North Carolina has the lowest percentage of union membership among workers of any state \u2014 only 2.4% of workers overall, which is less than one-quarter of the national average \u2014 leaders of the union\u2019s efforts said that they are confident about the outcome of the vote.\n\n\u201cAs you imagine Amazon has been doing everything to make sure we don\u2019t win,\u201d Italo Medelius-Marsano, an Amazon worker and one of the leaders of the campaign, told CNN. \u201cThe amount of money that Amazon is pouring into this, the people they\u2019re flying in to take us on, the propaganda \u2014 all of that tells us they\u2019re scared. That fear tells us that they know we\u2019re on the verge of something great.\u201d\n\nThe company said that it is confident that workers in Garner, a town of 35,000 just outside of Raleigh, want to keep the sorting and distribution warehouse union-free.\n\n\u201cWe believe our employees favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team,\u201d said a statement from Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards. \u201cThe fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits.\u201d\n\nThe company said it pays workers in the facility a starting wage of $18.50 an hour and top pay of $23.80 an hour. The union organizers said they\u2019ll be pressing for $30 an hour.\n\n\u201cI would challenge anyone to say $20 an hour is a livable wage here,\u201d said Medelius-Marsano. \u201cIn the Raleigh area, that\u2019s a slap in the face. Given the profits at Amazon and what it\u2019s worth, $30 an hour is incredibly reasonable.\u201d\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $2.4 trillion and made $59 billon in net income in 2024, nearly double what it made the year before.\n\nAmazon\u2019s history of fighting union efforts\n\nBut even if the union wins, it could take years to negotiate a first contract. Amazon has continued to challenge the union representation vote it lost at the Staten Island facility in court, nearly three years after the NLRB certified the vote results. And it has refused to negotiate with the Amazon Labor Union, the upstart union that won the vote, or the Teamsters union, with which ALU members voted to affiliate last year.\n\n\u201cAs we have shared before, we strongly disagree with the outcome of the election at (Staten Island),\u201d said Hards. \u201cBoth the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome and that is why we don\u2019t believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.\u201d The official total showed that 55% of the workers who voted supported the union.\n\nWorkers stand in line to cast ballots for a union election at Amazon's distribution center, in the Staten Island during the 2022 election, the only time that Amazon has lost a union vote at one of its locations. Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nOrganizers in Garner said they have gotten support from other unions that are trying to organize other Amazon facilities and that it has learned from past union defeats at the company. Amazon has defeated union organizing votes twice at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama, as well as at a second Staten Island facility next to the one that voted for the union, as well as one just outside of Albany, New York.\n\nBut the organizers in North Carolina said the fact that theirs is an independent union is an advantage.\n\n\u201cAmazon paints us as an outside group,\u201d said Ryan Brown, a union organizer who was fired by Amazon in December, after five years at the company. \u201cBut the workers here know we\u2019re not outsiders. Those of us who have lived in the South all of our lives know our culture, which is that we\u2019re skeptical of strangers, of outsiders.\u201d\n\nBrown and the union claim that his firing was due to his union activity. The company denies this, saying it was due to \u201crepeated and well-documented incidents of misconduct.\u201d\n\nBut despite Amazon trying to hold back union representation, it has been facing greater pressure than ever before from union efforts.\n\nUnions stepping up efforts at Amazon\n\nWorkers at a Whole Foods in Philadelphia just became the first at the Amazon-owned grocery chain to vote to for a union.\n\nAnd the Teamsters announced a six-day strike just before Christmas.\n\nIn addition to the workers in Staten Island, that strike primarily involved drivers who deliver packages for Amazon exclusively but who the company argues are not its employees, because they officially work for \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d\n\nAmazon delivery drivers walk the picket line outside Amazon delivery station as they went on strike in Skokie, Illinois in December. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCAUSE filed complaints of unfair labor practices against Amazon on Thursday, which is not unusual, as the company already has multiple such complaints filed against it with the NLRB. The labor agency staff and administrative law judges have found against Amazon in numerous cases.\n\nOne of those judges issued a decision finding substantiated unfair labor practice allegations against Amazon, requiring the court to set aside the 2022 rerun election in Alabama and ordering a third election there. But before that can happen that case needs to be considered by the agency\u2019s full board, and upon taking office, President Donald Trump fired a sitting NLRB board member for the first time in history, which means there is no longer the quorum necessary to hear such cases. The fired board member is challenging her dismissal in court.\n\nSo even if a union is to win the vote, it will face an uphill battle to win the contract it says its members deserve, given Amazon\u2019s track record fighting unionization efforts in the rest of the country. The union leaders said they\u2019re ready for that.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the civil rights movement, it was years and years to get the justice some Americans weren\u2019t getting,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI am committed to this fight for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe workers want Amazon to recognize their humanity and not treat them like a robots,\u201d said Medelius-Marsano. \u201cOur cheap labor has helped produce so much wealth. But they won\u2019t even meet us halfway.\u201d",

These services can be black boxes that fail to provide customers with the data necessary to assess how they function. In some instances, the tools involved may be no more sophisticated than web page searches for unsafe keywords, which can cause problems for news sites that report on difficult subjects and can be bypassed by bad actors through deliberate misspellings.\n\nMillions\n\nThe inquiry from lawmakers follows a report from Adalytics that found past evidence of CSAM on free image sharing sites imgbb.com and ibb.co (currently redirects to imgbb.com), which reportedly receive more than 40 million page views per month \u2013 more than several popular news sites.\n\nAdalytics says it found the abuse material while conducting research about how US government ads were served to bots and crawlers.\n\n\"Adalytics unintentionally and accidentally came across a historical, archived instance where a major advertiser's digital ads were served to a URLScan.io bot that was crawling and archiving an ibb.co page which appeared to be displaying explicit imagery of a young child,\" the report says, adding the biz immediately ceased viewing the archived page and reported the incident to the FBI, US Homeland Security special agents, America's National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the Canadian Center for Child Protection (C3P).\n\nAccording to NCMEC, imgbb.com has been alerted dozens of times in 2021, 2022, and 2023 about the presence of CSAM on its platform, the report says. The website does not state who owns it, where it is incorporated, nor where it's located. The domain is registered through GoDaddy, via Domains By Proxy, and relies on Cloudflare as its name server.\n\nA request for comment to imgbb.com has not been answered.\n\n\"In addition to hosting CSAM, imgbb.com and ibb.co appear to host explicit adult content as well as potentially copyright infringing materials,\" the report says, and also cites potential animal abuse material.\n\nImgbb.com appears to support its free image hosting service by displaying online ads from ad tech vendors Amazon, Google, Critero, Microsoft, Nexxen, Outbrain, Quantcast, TripleLift, and Zeta Global, among others.\n\nAnd numerous major advertisers are said to have run ads on these websites since 2021, it's claimed, including Acer, Adidas, Adobe, Amazon Prime, Dyson, Google Pixel, Hallmark, Honda, HP, MasterCard, Starbucks, Unilever, and the US Department of Homeland Security, among others.\n\nWhile Google AdX, Google Ad Manager, and DV 360 have not been showing ads on the image hosting service as of January 2025, other companies continue to do so, Adalytics claims.\n\nThe question is why companies place ads on web pages with illegal, explicit, or unacceptable content, given that the selling point of online ads is the ability to audit and measure how, where, and to whom ads get displayed.\n\nOne reason appears to be lack of visibility. Adalytics notes that several major brand advertisers whose ads were served on imgbb.com report that their ad tech providers, such as Amazon, fail to provide advertisers with page level URL reporting that would allow brands to see where their ads are appearing. This is particularly an issue with programmatic advertising, where ads are bought through an exchange linking multiple networks, as opposed to specific networks like Google Ads or Microsoft Ads.\n\nThe opaqueness of the ad tech ecosystem is compounded, the report suggests, because ibb.co allows uploaded images to be marked \"noindex,\" which keeps them from showing up in Google or Bing search results.\n\nAnother reason is that brand safety services appear unable to guarantee safety, an issue raised by the Senators' letters. According to Adalytics, numerous advertisers report that their brand safety vendors had marked 100 percent of the measured ad impressions on imgbb.com and ibb.co as safe \u2013 meaning the pages had content suitable for hosting ads. But Adalytics says that independent URLScan.io data shows some of the ads purchased were served with explicit sexual content.\n\nIt may be that AI image recognition technology, such as DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, isn't as adept at image identification as the company suggests.\n\nThe Register asked DoubleVerify whether it can provide data on false positives \u2013 unsafe images labeled safe.\n\nInstead of answering that question, a company spokesperson responded with a link to an online statement that addresses the Adalytics report.\n\nDoubleVerify's statement, which accuses Adalytics of past inaccuracies, claims: The report only cites a single website, imgbb.com, that has a small advertising footprint (0.000047 percent of to DoubleVerify-measured ads); DoubleVerify has blocked the site; and DoubleVerify has policies and processes in place to deal with illegal content.\n\n\"In light of this report\u2019s claims, DV is conducting an additional comprehensive review of ad-supported image-hosting sites on the open web that are within our system \u2013 even those that may have very small ad impression volumes \u2013 and placing them under stricter classification standards,\" the company's statement says. \"Additionally, we are defining a mechanism to block anonymous, profile-based image-hosting sites at scale.

            "content": "On Friday, backers of Proposition 1A, the initiative creating a dedicated funding source for Seattle\u2019s social housing developer, took to the streets of Denny Triangle in an attempt to highlight a flood of cash pouring in to support a competing measure. Standing in front of the Amazon Spheres, members of House Our Neighbors, the MLK Labor Council, and the 37th District Democrats decried an attempt to sway special-election voters with a last-minute wave of campaign cash.\n\nThe recipient of all that cash is pro-Initiative 1B political action committee called \u201cPeople for Responsible Social Housing.\u201d The Seattle City Council established Initiative 1B as an alternative to stand alongside 1A and its 5% payroll tax paid by companies within Seattle on the portion of payroll that goes toward compensating individual employees in excess of $1 million. It is largely companies with very high paid executives that are pumping money into the effort to derail Prop 1A.\n\nA pair of $100,000 donations by both Amazon and Microsoft in late January joined contributions from an array of business moguls and corporations, including Puget Sound Energy, Alaska Airlines, and Russell Investments. Glassblowing artists Dale and Leslie Chihuly chipped in $1,000 each. The late donations have pushed total pro-1B political spending past $500,000 \u2014 more than doubling the amount that Prop 1A backers have raised. Guy Oron at Real Change has a full breakdown of the campaign cash.\n\nIn contrast with 1A, which would create the first dedicated funding source for social housing in Seattle\u2019s history, Initiative 1B would divert $10 million annually from Seattle\u2019s existing JumpStart high-earner payroll tax to fund affordable housing targeting residents making 80% of King County\u2019s area median income or below, instituting no new funding source of its own. Last fall, the Seattle City Council put forward the alternative after they received the grassroots Initiative 137, which was signed by more than 38,000 city residents, after delaying action that would have put the measure on the higher-turnout November ballot.\n\nProp 1A, originally Initiative 137, came about via grassroots advocacy, with signature gatherers getting over 38,000 Seattle residents to put the question of taxing corporations to fund social housing on the ballot. (Ryan Packer)\n\nThe Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which has donated over $40,000 to promote Prop 1B (including some in-kind donations), was one of the most outspoken opponents of the JumpStart payroll tax when it was proposed in 2020, even taking the measure to the state court of appeals after it was approved. Now, the business advocacy group is on board with utilizing JumpStart revenues as long as it translates to no additional taxes on the city\u2019s businesses.\n\n\u201cJeff Bezos already bought one Washington. He will not buy this one,\u201d Katie Garrow, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the MLK Labor council, told the crowd. \u201cAt a time when Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and yes, even [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella are bending the knee to President Trump and turning D.C. into an oligarchy, Seattle is the last stand. We cannot let them hoard all the power wealth and resources of our beautiful region. They are not like us. They are not even mainstream. They are a malignant political force who are keeping us house and rent poor.\u201d\n\nThe last-minute check from Amazon may remind Seattle voters of 2019, when the company donated $1.45 million days before the general election to support a slate of centrist city council candidates. That move was widely seen as backfiring, with only two of the seven candidates winning their elections. But with this year\u2019s lower-turnout special election, Seattle\u2019s largest companies don\u2019t seem worried about a repeat performance.\n\nMuch of the newly donated cash is funding mailers featuring Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell touting a \u201csmart way\u201d to build social housing, and discounting the Seattle Social Housing Developer \u2014 which was established in 2023 via a separate grassroots initiative \u2014 as inexperienced. Yet option 1B wouldn\u2019t even fund social housing, which uses rents generated by working-class tenants making around the county\u2019s median income to cross subsidize other lower income tenants who can\u2019t pay as much, creating mixed-income communities. Instead, Prop 1B sticks to the traditional model that builds exclusively low-income housing, often relying on federal subsidies to close the gap to cover costs \u2014 replacing what numerous nonprofits already do.\n\nSeattle Mayor Bruce Harrell endorsed Proposition 1B for the February 11, 2025 election, siding with big business over a grassroots campaign to fund social housing. (Mailer by People for Responsible Social Housing)\n\nFormer city council candidate Ron Davis, who broke down the ways that pro-1B mailers have been deceptive in an article last week in The Urbanist, was on hand Friday to debunk those talking points in person.\n\n\u201cSeattle said no to Amazon last time when they screwed with our elections, and we\u2019re going to do it again,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe all know that if Seattle voters learn that Amazon\u2019s been bankrolling Donald Trump and is trying to buy this election, they will not vote with that. So we are not going to let them quietly line their pockets.\u201d\n\nRecent polling from the Northwest Progressive Institute showed a very tight race between 1A and 1B, with the grassroots social housing measure only two points ahead of the council-concocted plan B. Voters have until 8pm on Tuesday, February 11 to get their ballots in \u2014 but as of Friday, only around 15% of Seattle voters had done so. While I-135, the 2023 initiative that set up the social housing developer, passed by a strong 14-point margin, this election is poised to be much closer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the Democratic Party is a big tent,\u201d 37th District Democrats chair Mary Scanlon said. \u201cBut no matter how big our tent is, it has no room in it for big companies that throw piles of money at our elections to keep their own taxes low while preventing new funding for affordable housing.\u201d",

It\u2019s where you unwind after a long day, where you host guests, where you have family movie nights, etc\u2014it might even be where you work from home if you don\u2019t have a separate, dedicated office space. Needless to say, it\u2019s important for your living room to feel cozy and welcoming, and to be a space that truly reflects your style and interests. Luckily, it\u2019s pretty easy (and affordable!) to give your living room a refresh that does just that.\n\nAs an interior designer who often works with clients remotely, scouring the internet for beautiful home goods is a big part of my job. So, I browsed Amazon to bring you some of the best living room decor and furniture picks that caught my eye\u2014as well as some tried-and-true pieces I own myself. Shop them below starting at just $13, and give your living room the budget-friendly designer-approved upgrade it deserves.\n\nDesigner-Approved Living Room Decor on Amazon\n\nMonday Moose Set of 2 Scalloped Velvet Throw Pillow Covers\n\nAmazon\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to change up your existing decor, there\u2019s pretty much no easier way than to swap out your throw pillow covers. I love these funky scalloped velvet pillow covers because of their contrast piping\u2014a colorful, modern twist on traditional style. They come in 10 different color combinations to match (or inspire!) the rest of your interior aesthetic, though I\u2019m partial to this fun pink and blue colorway. They can fit most standard square throw pillows since they\u2019re available in three different sizes, including 16 inches by 16 inches, 18 inches by 18 inches, and 20 inches by 20 inches. You can snag a set of two starting at $31, but they\u2019ll definitely give your living room a much more expensive-looking upgrade.\n\nGeezo Electric Candle Warmer Lamp\n\nAmazon\n\nI was given a similar candle warmer lamp a few years ago as a gift, and it quickly became one of my favorite decor pieces ever. It\u2019s cute and stylish and adds a nice ambient glow to the room, yes, but it also makes enjoying my collection of scented candles so much nicer. First off, with a candle warmer lamp, you no longer have to worry about having an open flame in your home when using candles, since the bulb melts the wax instead. As the wax melts, the scent is dispersed more subtly throughout the living room, and it melts more evenly than it would when lit. Not to mention, I\u2019ve noticed my candles last much, much longer when I use them in the lamp versus when I would burn them, which is a huge perk.\n\n\"Wild Interiors\" by Hilton Carter\n\nAmazon\n\nCoffee table books are an awesome way to add color and pattern to your living room while also showing off your personality and your interests. Any graphic hardcover book you love that works with your space\u2019s existing color scheme is great, but if you need a book suggestion, I love Hilton Carter\u2019s Wild Interiors\u2014it\u2019s the ideal blend of gorgeous interiors and lush houseplants, and the cover and spine are absolutely stunning. It\u2019s perfect if your living room could use a pop of color, and it looks just as beautiful alone on the table as it would in a short stack of books.\n\nKeep scrolling to shop more of my living room decor picks, including my go-to frames for larger art, my favorite candle brand, a sleek and stylish mid-century modern coffee table, side tables that can show off pretty books and magazines, coasters, and more\u2014not to mention, the superbly soft and beautiful area rug that anchors my own living room.\n\nCraig Frames 16\u201d by 20\u201d Ornate Gold Frame\n\nAmazon\n\nFirminana Mid-Century Modern Coffee Table\n\nAmazon\n\nEtspolt Set of 4 Multicolor Acrylic Coasters\n\nAmazon\n\nLoloi x Rifle Paper Co.

When combined with Amazon OpenSearch Service, it enables robust Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. This post shows you how to set up RAG using DeepSeek-R1 on Amazon SageMaker with an OpenSearch Service vector database as the knowledge base. This example provides a solution for enterprises looking to enhance their AI capabilities.\n\nOpenSearch Service provides rich capabilities for RAG use cases, as well as vector embedding-powered semantic search. You can use the flexible connector framework and search flow pipelines in OpenSearch to connect to models hosted by DeepSeek, Cohere, and OpenAI, as well as models hosted on Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker. In this post, we build a connection to DeepSeek\u2019s text generation model, supporting a RAG workflow to generate text responses to user queries.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nIn this walkthrough, you will use a set of scripts to create the preceding architecture and data flow. First, you will create an OpenSearch Service domain, and deploy DeepSeek-R1 to SageMaker. You will execute scripts to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for invoking SageMaker, and a role for your user to create a connector to SageMaker. You will create an OpenSearch connector and model that will enable the retrieval_augmented_generation processor within OpenSearch to execute a user query, perform a search, and use DeepSeek to generate a text response. You will create a connector to SageMaker with Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 to create embeddings for a set of documents with population statistics. Finally, you will execute the query to compare population growth in Miami and New York City.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nWe\u2019ve created and open-sourced a GitHub repo with all the code you need to follow along with the post and deploy it for yourself. You will need the following prerequisites:\n\nGit \u2013 Clone the repo at https://github.com/Jon-AtAWS/opensearch-examples.git.\n\n\u2013 Clone the repo at https://github.com/Jon-AtAWS/opensearch-examples.git.

AWS CLI \u2013 Make sure to configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) with the account you plan to use. Alternately, you can follow the Boto 3 documentation to make sure you use the right credentials.\n\nDeploy DeepSeek on Amazon SageMaker\n\nYou will need to have or deploy DeepSeek with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. To learn more about deploying DeepSeek-R1 on SageMaker, refer to Deploying DeepSeek-R1 Distill Model on AWS using Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\nCreate an OpenSearch Service domain\n\nRefer to Create an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain for instructions on how to create your domain. Make note of the domain Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and domain endpoint, both of which can be found in the General information section of each domain on the OpenSearch Service console.\n\nDownload and prepare the code\n\nRun the following steps from your local computer or workspace that has Python and git:\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, clone the repo into a local folder using the following command:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Jon-AtAWS/opensearch-examples.git\n\nCreate a Python virtual environment:\n\ncd opensearch-examples/opensearch-deepseek-rag python -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThe example scripts use environment variables for setting some common parameters. Set these up now using the following commands. Be sure to update with your AWS Region, your SageMaker endpoint ARN and URL, your OpenSearch Service domain\u2019s endpoint and ARN, and your domain\u2019s primary user and password.\n\nexport DEEPSEEK_AWS_REGION='<your current region>' export SAGEMAKER_MODEL_INFERENCE_ARN='<your SageMaker endpoint\u2019s ARN>' export SAGEMAKER_MODEL_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT='<your SageMaker endpoint\u2019s URL>' export OPENSEARCH_SERVICE_DOMAIN_ARN='<your domain\u2019s ARN>\u2019 export OPENSEARCH_SERVICE_DOMAIN_ENDPOINT='<your domain\u2019s API endpoint>' export OPENSEARCH_SERVICE_ADMIN_USER='<your domain\u2019s master user name>' export OPENSEARCH_SERVICE_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<your domain\u2019s master user password>'\n\nYou now have the code base and have your virtual environment set up. You can examine the contents of the opensearch-deepseek-rag directory. For clarity of purpose and reading, we\u2019ve encapsulated each of seven steps in its own Python script. This post will guide you through running these scripts. We\u2019ve also chosen to use environment variables to pass parameters between scripts. In an actual solution, you would encapsulate the code in classes and pass the values where needed. Coding this way is clearer, but is less efficient and doesn\u2019t follow coding best practices. Use these scripts as examples to pull from.\n\nFirst, you will set up permissions for your OpenSearch Service domain to connect to your SageMaker endpoint.\n\nSet up permissions\n\nYou will create two IAM roles. The first will allow OpenSearch to call your SageMaker endpoint. The second will allow you to make the create connector API call to OpenSearch.\n\nExamine the code in create_invoke_role.py. Return to the command line, and execute the script:\n\npython create_invoke_role.py\n\nExecute the command line from the script\u2019s output to set the INVOKE_DEEPSEEK_ROLE environment variable.\n\nYou have created a role named invoke_deepseek_role, with a trust relationship for OpenSearch Service to assume the role, and with a permission policy that allows OpenSearch Service to invoke your SageMaker endpoint. The script outputs the ARNs for your role and policy and additionally a command line command to add the role to your environment. Execute that command before running the next script. Make a note of the role ARN in case you need to return at a later time.\n\nNow you need to create a role for your user to be able to create a connector in OpenSearch Service.\n\nExamine the code in create_connector_role.py. Return to the command line and execute the script:\n\npython create_connector_role.py\n\nExecute the command line from the script\u2019s output to set the CREATE_DEEPSEEK_CONNECTOR_ROLE environment variable.\n\nYou have created a role named create_deepseek_connector_role, with a trust relationship with the current user and permissions to write to OpenSearch Service. You need these permissions to call the OpenSearch create_connector API, which packages a connection to a remote model host, DeepSeek in this case. The script prints the policy\u2019s and role\u2019s ARNs, and additionally a command line command to add the role to your environment. Execute that command before running the next script. Again, make note of the role ARN, just in case.\n\nNow that you have your roles created, you will tell OpenSearch about them. The fine-grained access control feature includes an OpenSearch role, ml_full_access, that will allow authenticated entities to execute API calls within OpenSearch.\n\nExamine the code in setup_opensearch_security.py. Return to the command line and execute the script:\n\npython setup_opensearch_security.py\n\nYou set up the OpenSearch Service security plugin to recognize two AWS roles: invoke_create_connector_role and LambdaInvokeOpenSearchMLCommonsRole. You will use the second role later, when you connect with an embedding model and load data into OpenSearch to use as a RAG knowledge base. Now that you have permissions in place, you can create the connector.\n\nCreate the connector\n\nYou create a connector with configuration that tells OpenSearch how to connect, provides credentials for the target model host, and provides prompt details. For more information, see Creating connectors for third-party ML platforms.\n\nExamine the code in create_connector.py. Return to the command line and execute the script:\n\npython create_connector.py\n\nExecute the command line from the script\u2019s output to set the DEEPSEEK_CONNECTOR_ID environment variable.\n\nThe script will create the connector to call the SageMaker endpoint and return the connector ID. The connector is an OpenSearch construct that tells OpenSearch how to connect to an external model host. You don\u2019t use it directly; you create an OpenSearch model for that.\n\nCreate an OpenSearch model\n\nWhen you work with machine learning (ML) models, in OpenSearch, you use OpenSearch\u2019s ml-commons plugin to create a model. ML models are an OpenSearch abstraction that let you perform ML tasks like sending text for embeddings during indexing, or calling out to a large language model (LLM) to generate text in a search pipeline. The model interface provides you with a model ID in a model group that you then use in your ingest pipelines and search pipelines.\n\nExamine the code in create_deepseek_model.py. Return to the command line and execute the script:\n\npython create_deepseek_model.py\n\nExecute the command line from the script\u2019s output to set the DEEPSEEK_MODEL_ID environment variable.\n\nYou created an OpenSearch ML model group and model that you can use to create ingest and search pipelines. The _register API places the model in the model group and references your SageMaker endpoint through the connector (connector_id) you created.\n\nVerify your setup\n\nYou can run a query to verify your setup and make sure that you can connect to DeepSeek on SageMaker and receive generated text. Complete the following steps:\n\nOn the OpenSearch Service console, choose Dashboard under Managed clusters in the navigation pane. Choose your domain\u2019s dashboard.\n\nChoose the OpenSearch Dashboards URL (dual stack) link to open OpenSearch Dashboards. Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards with your primary user name and password. Dismiss the welcome dialog by choosing Explore on my own. Dismiss the new look and feel dialog. Confirm the global tenant in the Select your tenant dialog. Navigate to the Dev Tools tab. Dismiss the welcome dialog.\n\nYou can also get to Dev Tools by expanding the navigation menu (three lines) to reveal the navigation pane, and scrolling down to Dev Tools.\n\nThe Dev Tools page provides a left pane where you enter REST API calls. You execute the commands and the right pane shows the output of the command. Enter the following command in the left pane, replace your_model_id with the model ID you created, and run the command by placing the cursor anywhere in the command and choosing the run icon.\n\nPOST _plugins/_ml/models/<your model ID>/_predict{ \"parameters\": { \"inputs\": \"Hello\" }}\n\nYou should see output like the following screenshot.\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve now created and deployed an ML model that can use the connector you created to call to your SageMaker endpoint, and use DeepSeek to generate text. Next, you will use your model in an OpenSearch search pipeline to automate a RAG workflow.\n\nSet up a RAG workflow\n\nRAG is a way of adding information to the prompt so that the LLM generating the response is more accurate. An overall generative application like a chatbot orchestrates a call to external knowledge bases and augments the prompt with knowledge from those sources. We\u2019ve created a small knowledge base comprising population information.\n\nOpenSearch provides search pipelines, which are sets of OpenSearch search processors that are applied to the search request sequentially to build a final result. OpenSearch has processors for hybrid search, reranking, and RAG, among others. You define your processor and then send your queries to the pipeline. OpenSearch responds with the final result.\n\nWhen you build a RAG application, you choose a knowledge base and a retrieval mechanism. In most cases, you will use an OpenSearch Service vector database as a knowledge base, performing a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search to incorporate semantic information in the retrieval with vector embeddings. OpenSearch Service provides integrations with vector embedding models hosted in Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker (among other options).\n\nMake sure that your domain is running OpenSearch 2.9 or later, and that fine-grained access control is enabled for the domain. Then complete the following steps:\n\nOn the OpenSearch Service console, choose Integrations in the navigation pane. Choose Configure domain under Integration with text embedding models through Amazon SageMaker.\n\nChoose Configure public domain. If you created a virtual private cloud (VPC) domain instead, choose Configure VPC domain.\n\nYou will be redirected to the AWS CloudFormation console.\n\nFor Amazon OpenSearch Endpoint, enter your endpoint. Leave everything else as default values.\n\nThe CloudFormation stack requires a role to create a connector to the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, hosted on SageMaker, called LambdaInvokeOpenSearchMLCommonsRole. You enabled access for this role when you ran setup_opensearch_security.py. If you changed the name in that script, be sure to change it in the Lambda Invoke OpenSearch ML Commons Role Name field.\n\nSelect I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names, and choose Create stack.\n\nFor simplicity, we\u2019ve elected to use the open source all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, hosted on SageMaker for embedding generation. To achieve high search quality for production workloads, you should fine-tune lightweight models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2, or use OpenSearch Service integrations with models such as Cohere Embed V3 on Amazon Bedrock or Amazon Titan Text Embedding V2, which are designed to deliver high out-of-the-box quality.\n\nWait for CloudFormation to deploy your stack and the status to change to Create_Complete.\n\nChoose the stack\u2019s Outputs tab on the CloudFormation console and copy the value for ModelID.\n\nYou will use this model ID to connect with your embedding model.\n\nExamine the code in load_data.py. Return to the command line and set an environment variable with the model ID of the embedding model:\n\nexport EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID='<the model ID from CloudFormation\u2019s output>'\n\nExecute the script to load data into your domain:\n\npython load_data.py\n\nThe script creates the population_data index and an OpenSearch ingest pipeline that calls SageMaker using the connector referenced by the embedding model ID. The ingest pipeline\u2019s field mapping tells OpenSearch the source and destination fields for each document\u2019s embedding.\n\nNow that you have your knowledge base prepared, you can run a RAG query.\n\nExamine the code in run_rag.py. Return to the command line and execute the script:\n\npython run_rag.py\n\nThe script creates a search pipeline with an OpenSearch retrieval_augmented_generation processor. The processor automates running an OpenSearch k-NN query to retrieve relevant information and adding that information to the prompt. It uses the generation_model_id and connector to the DeepSeek model on SageMaker to generate a text response for the user\u2019s question. The OpenSearch neural query (line 55 of run_rag.py) takes care of generating the embedding for the k-NN query using the embedding_model_id. In the ext section of the query, you provide the user\u2019s question for the LLM. The llm_model is set to bedrock/claude because the parameterization and actions are the same as they are for DeepSeek. You\u2019re still using DeepSeek to generate text.\n\nExamine the output from OpenSearch Service. The user asked the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023? How is the trending comparing with Miami?\u201d The first portion of the result shows the hits\u2014documents OpenSearch retrieved from the semantic query\u2014as the population statistics for New York City and Miami. The next section of the response includes the prompt, as well as DeepSeek\u2019s answer.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023 and compare it with Miami's growth. Let me start by looking at the data provided in the search results. From SEARCH RESULT 2, I see that in 2021, NYC had a population of 18,823,000. In 2022, it was 18,867,000, and in 2023, it's 18,937,000. So, the increase from 2021 to 2022 is 18,867,000 - 18,823,000 = 44,000. Then from 2022 to 2023, it's 18,937,000 - 18,867,000 = 70,000. Adding those together, the total increase from 2021 to 2023 is 44,000 + 70,000 = 114,000. Now, looking at Miami's data in SEARCH RESULT 1. In 2021, Miami's population was 6,167,000, in 2022 it was 6,215,000, and in 2023 it's 6,265,000. The increase from 2021 to 2022 is 6,215,000 - 6,167,000 = 48,000. From 2022 to 2023, it's 6,265,000 - 6,215,000 = 50,000. So, the total increase is 48,000 + 50,000 = 98,000.Comparing the two, NYC's increase of 114,000 is higher than Miami's 98,000. So, NYC's population increased more over that period.\"\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve connected to an embedding model, created a knowledge base, and used that knowledge base, along with DeepSeek, to generate a text response to a question on population changes in New York City and Miami. You can adapt the code from this post to create your own knowledge base and run your own queries.\n\nClean up\n\nTo avoid incurring additional charges, clean up the resources you deployed:\n\nDelete the SageMaker deployment of DeepSeek. For instructions, see Cleaning Up. If your Jupyter notebook has lost context, you can delete the endpoint: On the SageMaker console, under Inference in the navigation pane, choose Endpoints. Select your endpoint and choose Delete. Delete the CloudFormation template for connecting to SageMaker for the embedding model. Delete the OpenSearch Service domain you created.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe OpenSearch connector framework is a flexible way for you to access models you host on other platforms. In this example, you connected to the open source DeepSeek model that you deployed on SageMaker. DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning capabilities, augmented with a knowledge base in the OpenSearch Service vector engine, enabled it to answer a question comparing population growth in New York and Miami.\n\nFind out more about AI/ML capabilities of OpenSearch Service, and let us know how you are using DeepSeek and other generative models to build!\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nJon Handler is the Director of Solutions Architecture for Search Services at Amazon Web Services, based in Palo Alto, CA.

            "content": "\n\nAttorney General Brian L. Schwalb today announced a $3.95 million settlement with Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Logistics, Inc. (Amazon) to resolve a lawsuit filed by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), which alleged that the company misled DC consumers by assuring them that 100% of tips would go to Amazon Flex delivery drivers when in fact much of the tips were diverted to reduce Amazon\u2019s labor costs and increase profits. As a result of previous legal action, Amazon drivers have already been reimbursed for the wages they were denied. Now, under this agreement, Amazon is required to pay additional financial penalties, cover the cost of OAG\u2019s litigation, and change its business practices to clearly disclose how tips are being used.\n\n\n\n\"When companies mislead customers to boost their profits by stealing tips intended for their workers, they are cheating their consumers, their employees, and their competitors who play by the rules,\" said Attorney General Schwalb. \"It\u2019s not sufficient, after being caught, to simply give back the ill-gotten gains. Rather, there must be meaningful consequences to deter misconduct from happening in the first place. Especially when living expenses are harder and harder to afford, my office will continue to ensure that hardworking District residents receive every penny of their earnings and consumers have confidence that they are not being misled.\"\n\nAmazon launched its Amazon Flex service, which offers fast delivery of Amazon products, in 2015. During the checkout process, Amazon encouraged consumers to tip their delivery drivers, offering a default tip amount and assuring consumers that 100% of tips would go to the drivers. In 2016, Amazon changed its driver payment model so that a large portion of tips did not go towards increasing drivers\u2019 total compensation but were instead used to cover a portion of the base wages Amazon had promised to pay the drivers. Amazon hid this change and continued assuring consumers that all of the tips would go to drivers, even though the company was using tips to cover its own existing obligations to drivers.\n\nOAG filed suit in 2022, alleging that Amazon violated the District\u2019s consumer protection laws by falsely leading customers to believe their tips were increasing delivery worker pay by the amount they tipped. The lawsuit detailed how DC consumers paid millions of dollars in tips, believing they were rewarding delivery drivers for the service they provided, while in effect Amazon captured much of the tips to save on its own operating costs. Amazon reimbursed Amazon Flex drivers for the misappropriated tips as part of a previous restitution-only settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. OAG brought its lawsuit for injunctive relief and civil penalties under District law because it is not enough for a company to repay stolen funds\u2014significant fines are necessary to disincentivize unlawful behavior.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, Amazon must:\n\nPay $3.95 million to the District. This includes $2.45 million in penalties and $1.5 million in costs.\n\n\n\nThis includes $2.45 million in penalties and $1.5 million in costs. Maintain transparent tipping practices. If Amazon uses tips for any purpose other than increasing driver compensation, the company must make clear disclosures about how tips are used on both its website and its app.\n\nA copy of the settlement agreement is available here.\n\nThis matter was handled by Assistant Attorneys General Norman Anderson, Sarah Levine, Jessica Micciolo, Jude Nwaokobia, and Morgan Sperry, Workers\u2019 Rights and Antifraud Section Assistant Chief Dennis Corkery, and Workers\u2019 Rights and Antifraud Section Chief Graham Lake, investigators Kenithia Alson and Shelby Miller, and interns Kaylah Paras and Adam Strathearn.\n\nResources for District Residents\n\nTo report unfair business practices, scams, or fraud, you can contact OAG by:\n\nSubmitting a consumer complaint online at: https://oag.dc.gov/consumer-protection/submit-consumer-complaint\n\nCalling the OAG Consumer Hotline at (202) 442-9828\n\nEmailing consumer.protection@dc.gov\n\nVisit OAG\u2019s website to learn more about the office\u2019s work to protect DC consumers.\n\nHow to Report Wage and Hour Violations\n\nWorkers who believe that their rights have been violated, or that they have experienced wage theft or other wage and hour violations, can contact OAG by calling (202) 724-7730 or emailing workers@dc.gov or trabajadores@dc.gov.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenue derived from advertising increased 18% year over year to $17.29 billion in Q4 2024, according to an earnings statement. That marks a deceleration in the rate of growth from the year-ago period and a figure that narrowly missed analyst estimates.\n\nExecutives emphasized a focus on full-funnel advertising, including upper-funnel tactics that can build brand awareness. A key part of that strategy is Amazon Prime Video, which is entering its second year of running ads, but it\u2019s an area where Amazon still lacks maturity compared to its core retail media offerings.\n\nStill, the upper-funnel shift has helped Amazon attract more non-endemic advertisers, or advertisers that wouldn\u2019t normally sell products through its e-commerce marketplace, such as automotive and financial services brands. Ad-supported streaming is an area where competition is quickly heating up.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon\u2019s ad segment is a juggernaut that has made the company into one of the most formidable platforms in the digital media arena. That said, its rate of growth continues to cool, suggesting that areas like lower-funnel retail media are maturing while upper-funnel bets are too fresh to have yet realized their full monetization potential. Sponsored product ads, which remain the largest contributor to Amazon\u2019s advertising, still have a runway for more growth, CEO Andy Jassy said on a call discussing the results with investors.\n\n\u201cWe also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cOn the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we\u2019re quite pleased with the early progress and headed into this year with momentum.\u201d\n\nIn Q4 2023, Amazon\u2019s ad revenue was up 27%, compared to 18% over the same period in 2024. Despite the slowdown, the company is attracting an \u201cincreasingly large base\u201d of advertisers, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the analyst call.\n\nPrime Video is the core piece of Amazon\u2019s upper-funnel pitch, bolstered by prime-time programming like NFL \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d A strong content slate has welcomed non-endemic advertisers into the fold. Amazon\u2019s full-year advertising haul reached $56.2 billion in 2024, the first year in which ads ran on Prime Video. That\u2019s nearly double the figure from three years prior.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that Prime Video accounts for a significant portion of the roughly $19 billion that Amazon Ads saw in 2024 year-over-year net revenue growth,\u201d said Gartner Vice President Analyst Eric Schmitt in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cMuch of Amazon\u2019s growth is also coming from non-endemic sellers, such as financial services and telecom companies keen to tap into Amazon\u2019s audience reach, premium streaming TV inventory and built-in data assets and commerce connections,\u201d Schmitt added.\n\nSome sort of deceleration is to be expected as any business matures. Crucially for Amazon, advertising is still providing a boost to profitably, which could help as the e-commerce giant navigates future headwinds. Amazon reported robust Q4 earnings overall but its Q1 2025 forecast was weak, anticipating an \u201cunusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates.\n\nWhile Amazon was a front-runner in bringing premium live sports to streaming, it is facing stiffer competition in 2025. Netflix, which is also making ad-supported streaming a bigger part of its growth agenda, has seen traction thanks to moves like airing two Christmas Day NFL games and the blockbuster Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match last year.",

Given the profits at Amazon and what it\u2019s worth, $30 an hour is incredibly reasonable.\"\n\nAmazon, the nation\u2019s second largest private sector employer, has faced increasing pressure from unions in recent months. And despite the fact that North Carolina has the lowest percentage of union membership among workers of any state \u2013 only 2.4% of workers overall, which is less than one-quarter of the national average \u2013 leaders of the union\u2019s efforts said that they are confident about the outcome of the vote.\n\n\"As you imagine Amazon has been doing everything to make sure we don\u2019t win,\" said Medelius-Marsano. \"The amount of money that Amazon is pouring into this, the people they\u2019re flying in to take us on, the propaganda\u2014all of that tells us they\u2019re scared. That fear tells us that they know we\u2019re on the verge of something great.\"\n\nThe company said that it is confident that workers in Garner, a town of 35,000 just outside of Raleigh, want to keep the sorting and distribution warehouse union-free.\n\n\"The fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits,\" a statement from Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards read in part.\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $2.4 trillion and made $59 billon in net income in 2024, nearly double what it made the year before. Hards also said the upstart union has never negotiated a union contract anywhere and has \"no experience representing workers or their interest.\"\n\n\"No company is perfect, I understand that,\" said Sharron, an Amazon worker. \"But those imperfections are huge with they come to the employee. Amazon is making the money I think they made. We helped them make double what they made last year and we didn't get a Christmas bonus.\"\n\nHards provided CNN-affiliate WRAL News with the following statement:\n\n\u201cWe've always said that we want our employees to have their voices heard, and we hope and expect this process allows for that. We believe our employees favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team. The fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits\u2014including health care on day one, pre-paid college tuition, and a 401k with company match\u2014opportunities for career growth, and more.\"\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board is overseeing a six-day vote starting Monday, with votes due to be counted Saturday. A win by the union, Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, in the town of Garner would be just the second Amazon facility to see a union win a representation vote, following a 2022 election at one of the company\u2019s major sorting and distribution centers in Staten Island, New York.\n\nAmazon\u2019s history of fighting union efforts\n\nBut even if the union wins, it could take years to negotiate a first contract. Amazon has continued to challenge the union representation vote it lost at the Staten Island facility in court, nearly three years after the NLRB certified the vote results. And it has refused to negotiate with the Amazon Labor Union, the upstart union that won the vote, or the Teamsters union, with which ALU members voted to affiliate last year.\n\n\"As we have shared before, we strongly disagree with the outcome of the election at (Staten Island),\" said Hards. \"Both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome and that is why we don\u2019t believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.\"\n\nThe official total showed that 55% of the workers who voted supported the union.\n\nOrganizers in Garner said they have gotten support from other unions that are trying to organize other Amazon facilities and that it has learned from past union defeats at the company. Amazon has defeated union organizing votes twice at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama, as well as at a second Staten Island facility next to the one that voted for the union, as well as one just outside of Albany, New York.\n\nBut the organizers in North Carolina said the fact that theirs is an independent union is an advantage.\n\n\"Amazon paints us as an outside group,\" said Ryan Brown, a union organizer who was fired by Amazon in December, after five years at the company. \"But the workers here know we\u2019re not outsiders. Those of us who have lived in the South all of our lives know our culture, which is that we\u2019re skeptical of strangers, of outsiders.\"\n\nBrown and the union claim that his firing was due to his union activity. The company denies this, saying it was due to \"repeated and well-documented incidents of misconduct.\"\n\nBut despite Amazon trying to hold back union representation, it has been facing greater pressure than ever before from union efforts.\n\nUnions stepping up efforts at Amazon\n\nWorkers at a Whole Foods in Philadelphia just became the first at the Amazon-owned grocery chain to vote to for a union.\n\nAnd the Teamsters announced a six-day strike just before Christmas.\n\nIn addition to the workers in Staten Island, that strike primarily involved drivers who deliver packages for Amazon exclusively but who the company argues are not its employees, because they officially work for \"independent contractors.\"\n\nCAUSE filed complaints of unfair labor practices against Amazon on Thursday, which is not unusual, as the company already has multiple such complaints filed against it with the NLRB. The labor agency staff and administrative law judges have found against Amazon in numerous cases.\n\nOne of those judges issued a decision finding substantiated unfair labor practice allegations against Amazon, requiring the court to set aside the 2022 rerun election in Alabama and ordering a third election there. But before that can happen that case needs to be considered by the agency\u2019s full board, and upon taking office, President Donald Trump fired a sitting NLRB board member for the first time in history, which means there is no longer the quorum necessary to hear such cases. The fired board member is challenging her dismissal in court.\n\nSo even if a union is to win the vote, it will face an uphill battle to win the contract it says its members deserve, given Amazon\u2019s track record fighting unionization efforts in the rest of the country. The union leaders said they\u2019re ready for that.\n\n\"When you look at the civil rights movement, it was years and years to get the justice some Americans weren\u2019t getting,\" Brown said. \"I am committed to this fight for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"The workers want Amazon to recognize their humanity and not treat them like robots,\" Medelius-Marsano added. \"Our cheap labor has helped produce so much wealth. But they won\u2019t even meet us halfway.\"\n\nWRAL reporter Willie Daniely contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

            "content": "Amazon and Nokia are fighting over multiple streaming technology patents. The dispute at the Regional Court D\u00fcsseldorf concerned EP 2 271 048 B1 and EP 2 130 150 B1.\n\nEP 048 protects a method for provisioning a multimedia service to display additional information, for example about actors, in parallel to streaming a video. EP 150 covers systems, methods, devices and computer program products for arranging a user\u2019s media files. This technology is used, for example, to recommend other content that may be of interest to users of a streaming service.\n\nThe 4c Chamber of the Regional Court D\u00fcsseldorf has now found EP 048 infringed (case ID: 4c O 49/23). The panel included Sabine Wimmers and Stephan Janich and presiding judge Sabine Klepsch. The judges ordered Amazon to cease and desist from using the infringing technology in their video software and devices. They also ordered Amazon to provide information concerning the use since 1 January 2023. Furthermore, the court ruled Amazon must compensate the plaintiff for the damages incurred and to be incurred as a result of the infringement.\n\nIn order to enforce the ruling, Nokia must provide a security of \u20ac646.75 million.\n\nHowever, in the case of EP 150, the court dismissed the infringement claim (case ID 4c O 50/23).\n\nNokia filed several lawsuits against Amazon in autumn 2023 for the unauthorised use of Nokia\u2019s video-related technologies in its services and devices. The lawsuits focus on the Amazon Prime Video service and Amazon\u2019s streaming devices. In Europe, Nokia has filed lawsuits in Germany, the UK, and with the UPC. In a ruling of September 2024, the Munich Regional court found that Amazon infringed one of Nokia\u2019s patents.\n\nJUVE Patent does not yet know if the parties will appeal today\u2019s judgment. Parallel to the infringement proceedings, nullity actions against the two patents are pending at the German Federal Patent Court. In addition, Nokia has filed lawsuits in the US and India.\n\nFighting on many fronts\n\nIn the parallel proceedings at the UPC, the parties are disputing EP 2 661 892, covering motion prediction in video coding (case ID: UPC_CoA_835/2024). Nokia filed its first lawsuit at the court with the Munich local division.\n\nThe Finnish company has also sued Amazon at the UK High Court over three patents. In Germany, Amazon is facing one lawsuit each at the Mannheim and Munich regional courts in addition to the two lawsuits at D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Court.\n\nNokia\u2019s patents, some of which the patent holder considers SEPs, protect technologies for video compression, content delivery, content recommendation and aspects relating to hardware. They are relevant for video streaming, video coding and cloud computing.\n\nArnold Ruess for Nokia\n\nNokia turned to its regular advisors from D\u00fcsseldorf IP boutique Arnold Ruess, led by founding partner Bernhard Arnold and including partners Cordula Schumacher and Arno Ri\u00dfe. The team also included counsel Jan Wergin, Tim Smentkowski, and associates Sophia Zeng, Anja Penners, Felix K\u00f6tterheinrich and Felix Beck.\n\nThe representatives are also conducting the proceedings before the UPC.\n\nArnold Ruess is one of the Finnish tech company\u2019s go-to law firms when it comes to litigation in Germany. The litigators are also representing the client in parallel proceedings against HP before Munich Regional Court and the UPC, which also involve technology related to video streaming. They are also acting for Nokia against Amazon regarding HEVC patents.\n\nPartners and patent attorneys Christoph Walke, Matthias Waters, and Martin R\u00fctten of IP firm Cohausz & Florack provided support in technical matters. The teams worked closely with Armin Schwitulla, senior litigation counsel and Huw Edwards, director head of litigation operations at Nokia.\n\nAmazon turns to Hogan Lovells\n\nHogan Lovells is representing the defendant Amazon before the German courts as well as at the UPC. The international law firm\u2019s IP team is also acting for the US company in several proceedings, including the HEVC technology case.\n\nIn the current case, Munich-based partners Steffen Steininger and Benjamin Schr\u00f6er took the lead. Associates Nathaniel Kellerer, Fabian Langer and Teresa Sedelmaier assisted. The mixed team also included patent attorneys from the firm. Munich-based partner Andreas Schmid and associate Alexander Lebschy provided support in technical details.\n\nA London team from Hogan Lovells is active in the UK High Court action.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon reported capital expenditures of $26.3 billion during the final three months of 2024, primarily on infrastructure to support AI and cloud, CEO Andy Jassy said during a Thursday earnings call. The company expects to sustain that level of quarterly spending through the end of the year, exceeding $100 billion.\n\nThe executive defended elevated spend levels. \u201cWhen AWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly on what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign medium to long term for the AWS business,\u201d Jassy said.\n\nAWS\u2019 revenues increased 19% year over year in Q4 and the fiscal year to $28.8 billion and $107.6 billion, respectively. \u201cWe continued to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI offerings as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI,\u201d CFO Brian Olsavsky said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs generative AI boosted cloud consumption, the big three providers mounted a rapid response. AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud doubled down on infrastructure, pouring tens of billions of dollars into building the capacity needed to train AI models and satisfy enterprise demand in 2024.\n\nAWS ramped up capital spending throughout the year and the vendor\u2019s two primary cloud competitors followed suit. Microsoft CapEx grew to $22.6 billion during the final three months of last year and Google Cloud spent $14 billion in Q4.\n\nDespite posting capital investments that neared cloud revenues for the quarter, Amazon didn\u2019t blink Thursday. Instead, Jassy doubled down on AWS\u2019 buildout strategy, noting that revenues would have been higher if not for cloud capacity constraints.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to complain when you have a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI like we do, and it's growing triple-digit percentage year over year,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cHowever, it is true that we could be growing faster, if not for some of the constraints on capacity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to building out cloud infrastructure, Amazon expanded its partnership with generative AI model maker Anthropic in November, doubling its investment in the company to $8 billion. The company also unveiled its Nova multimodal LLM family and expanded an alliance with PwC around industry-tailored generative AI solutions as the year came to a close.\n\nJassy touted practical applications of AWS\u2019 suite of AI models, pointing to Amazon Q capabilities designed to help enterprises migrate applications from Windows to Linux, shift workloads from VMware to cloud and ease migration to cloud from mainframe.\n\n\u201cWhile AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of companies\u2019 technology infrastructure from on premises to the cloud,\u201d Jassy said.\n\nAWS expects capacity constraints to ease in the second half of the year but there are big hurdles to overcome.\n\n\u201cThe world is still constrained on power,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cThere are some components in the supply chain, like motherboards, too, that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers.\u201d",

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\n\nFirst Quarter 2025 Guidance\n\nNet sales are expected to be between $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion, or to grow between 5% and 9% compared with first quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or 150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates. Also, as a reminder, in first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately $1.5 billion in net sales.\n\nOperating income is expected to be between $14.0 billion and $18.0 billion, compared with $15.3 billion in first quarter 2024.\n\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

The DeepSeek-R1 models are now accessible through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, and distilled variants are available through Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. According to DeepSeek AI, these models offer strong capabilities in reasoning, coding, and natural language understanding. However, their deployment in production environments\u2014like all models\u2014requires careful consideration of data privacy requirements, appropriate management of bias in output, and the need for robust monitoring and control mechanisms.\n\nOrganizations adopting open source, open weights models such as DeepSeek-R1 have important opportunities to address several key considerations:\n\nEnhancing security measures to prevent potential misuse, guided by resources such as OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE Atlas\n\nMaking sure to protect sensitive information\n\nFostering responsible content generation practices\n\nStriving for compliance with relevant industry regulations\n\nThese concerns become particularly critical in highly regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and government services, where data privacy and content accuracy are paramount.\n\nThis blog post provides a comprehensive guide to implementing robust safety protections for DeepSeek-R1 and other open weight models using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. We\u2019ll explore:\n\nHow to use the security features offered by Amazon Bedrock to protect your data and applications\n\nPractical implementation of guardrails to prevent prompt attacks and filter harmful content\n\nImplementing a robust defense-in-depth strategy\n\nBy following this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to use the advanced capabilities of DeepSeek models while maintaining strong security controls and promoting ethical AI practices. Whether developing customer-facing generative AI applications or internal tools, these implementation patterns will help you meet your requirements for secure and responsible AI. By following this step-by-step approach, organizations can deploy open weights LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1 in line with best practices for AI safety and security.\n\nDeepSeek models and deployment on Amazon Bedrock\n\nDeepSeek AI, a company specializing in open weights foundation AI models, recently launched their DeepSeek-R1 models, which according to their paper have shown outstanding reasoning abilities and performance in industry benchmarks. According to third-party evaluations, these models consistently achieve top three rankings across various metrics, including quality index, scientific reasoning and knowledge, quantitative reasoning, and coding (HumanEval).\n\nThe company has further developed their portfolio by releasing six dense models derived from DeepSeek-R1, built on Llama and Qwen architectures, which they\u2019ve made open weight models. These models are now accessible through AWS generative AI solutions: DeepSeek-R1 is available through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and SageMaker Jumpstart, while the Llama-based distilled versions can be implemented through Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import.\n\nAmazon Bedrock offers comprehensive security features to help secure hosting and operation of open source and open weights models while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance. Key features include data encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained access controls, secure connectivity options, and various compliance certifications. Additionally, Amazon Bedrock provides guardrails for content filtering and sensitive information protection to support responsible AI use. AWS enhances these capabilities with extensive platform-wide security and compliance measures:\n\nOrganizations should customize these security settings based on their specific compliance and security needs when deploying to production environments. AWS conducts vulnerability scanning of all model containers as part of its security process and accepts only models in Safetensors format to help prevent unsafe code execution.\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards to help safely build generative AI applications at scale. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can also be integrated with other Amazon Bedrock tools including Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build safer and more secure generative AI applications aligned with responsible AI policies. To learn more, see the AWS Responsible AI page.\n\nCore functionality\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails can be used in two ways. First, it can be integrated directly with the InvokeModel and Converse API call, where guardrails are applied to both input prompts and model outputs during the inference process. This method is suitable with models hosted on Amazon Bedrock through the Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. Alternatively, the ApplyGuardrail API offers a more flexible approach, allowing for independent evaluation of content without invoking a model. This second method is useful for assessing inputs or outputs at various stages of an application, working with custom or third-party models outside of Amazon Bedrock. Both approaches enable developers to implement safeguards customized to their use cases and aligned with responsible AI policies, ensuring secure and compliant interactions in generative AI applications.\n\nKey Amazon Bedrock Guardrails policies\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails provides the following configurable guardrail policies to help safely build generative AI applications at scale:\n\nContent filters Adjustable filtering intensity for harmful content Predefined categories: Hate, Insults, Sexual Content, Violence, Misconduct, and Prompt Attacks Multi-modal content including text and images (preview)\n\nTopic filters Capability to restrict specific topics Prevention of unauthorized topics in both queries and responses\n\nWord filters Blocks specific words, phrases, and profanity Custom filters for offensive language or competitor references\n\nSensitive information filters Personally identifiable information (PII) blocking or masking Support for custom regex patterns Probabilistic detection for standard formats (such as SSN, DOB, and addresses)\n\nContextual grounding checks Hallucination detection through source grounding Query relevance validation\n\nAutomated Reasoning checks for hallucination prevention (gated preview)\n\nOther capabilities\n\nModel-agnostic implementation:\n\nCompatible with all Amazon Bedrock foundation models\n\nSupports fine-tuned models\n\nExtends to external custom and third-party models through the ApplyGuardrail API\n\nThis comprehensive framework helps customers implement responsible AI, maintaining content safety and user privacy across diverse generative AI applications.\n\nSolution Overview\n\nGuardrail configuration Create a guardrail with specific policies tailored to your use case and configure the policies.\n\nIntegration with InvokeModel API Call the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API with the guardrail identifier in your request.\n\nWhen you make the API call, Amazon Bedrock applies the specified guardrail to both the input and output.\n\nGuardrail evaluation process\n\nInput evaluation: Before sending the prompt to the model, the guardrail evaluates the user input against the configured policies. Parallel policy checking: For improved latency, the input is evaluated in parallel for each configured policy. Input intervention: If the input violates any guardrail policies, a pre-configured blocked message is returned, and the model inference is discarded. Model inference: If the input passes the guardrail checks, the prompt is sent to the specified model for inference. Output evaluation: After the model generates a response, the guardrail evaluates the output against the configured policies. Output intervention: If the model response violates any guardrail policies, it will be either blocked with a pre-configured message or have sensitive information masked, depending on the policy. Response delivery: If the output passes all guardrail checks, the response is returned to the application without modifications\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore setting up guardrails for models imported using the Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import feature, make sure you meet these prerequisites:\n\nAn AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock along with the necessary IAM role with the required permissions. For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center.\n\nMake sure that a custom model is already imported using the Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import service. For illustration, we\u2019ll use DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, which can be imported using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. You have two options for deploying this model: Follow the instructions in Deploy DeepSeek-R1 distilled Llama models to deploy DeepSeek\u2019s distilled Llama model. Use the notebook available from aws-samples for deployment.\n\n\n\nYou can create the guardrail using the AWS Management Console as explained in this blog post. Alternatively, you can follow this notebook for a programmatic example of how to create the guardrail in this solution. This notebook does the following :\n\nInstall the required dependencies Create a guardrail using the boto3 API and filters to meet the use case mentioned previously. Configure the tokenizer for the imported model. Test Amazon Bedrock Guardrails using prompts that show various Amazon Bedrock guardrail filters in action.\n\nThis approach integrates guardrails into both the user inputs and the model outputs. This makes sure that any potentially harmful or inappropriate content is intercepted during both phases of the interaction. For open weight distilled models imported using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, critical filters to implement include those for prompt attacks, content moderation, topic restrictions, and sensitive information protection.\n\nImplementing a defense-in-depth strategy with AWS services\n\nWhile Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides essential content and prompt safety controls, implementing a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy is crucial when deploying any foundation model, especially open weights models such as DeepSeek-R1. For detailed guidance on defense-in-depth approaches aligned with OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, see our previous blog post on architecting secure generative AI applications.\n\nKey highlights include:\n\nDeveloping organizational resiliency by starting with security in mind\n\nBuilding on a secure cloud foundation using AWS services\n\nApplying a layered defense strategy across multiple trust boundaries\n\nAddressing the OWASP Top 10 risks for LLM applications\n\nImplementing security best practices throughout the AI/ML lifecycle\n\nUsing AWS security services in conjunction with AI and machine learning (AI/ML)-specific features\n\nConsidering diverse perspectives and aligning security with business objectives\n\nPreparing for and mitigating risks such as prompt injection and data poisoning\n\nThe combination of model-level controls (guardrails) with a defense-in-depth strategy creates a robust security posture that can help protect against:\n\nData exfiltration attempts\n\nUnauthorized access to fine-tuned models or training data\n\nPotential vulnerabilities in model implementation\n\nMalicious use of AI agents and integrations\n\nWe recommend conducting thorough threat modeling exercises using AWS guidance for generative AI workloads before deploying any new AI/ML solutions. This helps align security controls with specific risk scenarios and business requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nImplementing safety protection for LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 models, is crucial for maintaining a secure and ethical AI environment. By using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API and the ApplyGuardrails API, you can help mitigate the risks associated with advanced language models while still harnessing their powerful capabilities. However, it\u2019s important to recognize that model-level protections are just one component of a comprehensive security strategy.\n\nThe strategies outlined in this post address several key security concerns that are common across various open weights models hosted on Amazon Bedrock using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, and through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. These include potential vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, the generation of harmful content, and other risks identified in recent assessments. By implementing these guardrails alongside a defense-in-depth approach, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of misuse and better align their AI applications with ethical standards and regulatory requirements.\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, it\u2019s essential to prioritize safety and responsible use of generative AI. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides a configurable and robust framework for implementing these safeguards, allowing developers to customize protection measures according to their specific use cases and organizational policies. We strongly recommend conducting thorough threat modeling of your AI workloads using AWS guidance to evaluate security risks and implementing appropriate controls across your entire technology stack.\n\nRemember to regularly review and update not only your guardrails but all security controls to address new potential vulnerabilities and help maintain protection against emerging threats in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI security. While today we focus on DeepSeek-R1 models, the AI landscape is continuously evolving with new models emerging regularly. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, combined with AWS security services and best practices, provides a consistent security framework that can adapt to protect your generative AI applications across various open weights models, both current and future. By treating security as a continuous process of assessment, improvement, and adaptation, organizations can confidently deploy innovative AI solutions while maintaining robust security controls.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nSatveer Khurpa is a Sr. WW Specialist Solutions Architect, Bedrock at Amazon Web Services.

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) stock slipped late Thursday despite fourth-quarter results that beat expectations. The tech giant guided for lower-than-expected sales and operating income for the current quarter, citing currency exchange headwinds.\n\nAmazon said in a news release that it earned $1.86 per share on sales of $187.8 billion. Investors, meanwhile, were expecting earnings of $1.49 per share and revenue of $187.3 billion from the Seattle-based tech behemoth.\n\nBut Amazon's forecast of $153.3 billion at the midpoint of its range was below previous analyst projections of $158.6 billion, according to FactSet. Amazon is the latest company to blame a strong dollar for weaker-than-expected revenue guidance. Amazon said in its news release that its Q1 guidance reflects \"an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or 150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates.\"\n\nThe company's Q1 guidance for operating income also came in lower than expected, at a midpoint of $16 billion compared with projections of $18.4 billion.\n\nAmazon said it expects operating income of $16 billion for the March quarter, at the midpoint of its range. Analysts were projecting $18.4 billon.\n\nOn the stock market today, Amazon stock shed more than 5% to 225.55 in after-hours action. Shares gained 1% to close at 238.83 in regular trading.\n\nAmazon Cloud Growth 'Immaterially Below' Views\n\nRBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson wrote to clients late Thursday that \"Amazon's Q4 was solid, with in-line overall revenue and a meaningful EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EPS beat. First-party retail was the main upside driver, which was offset by a slight miss from third-party and advertising and AWS immaterially below Street.\"\n\nAmazon's closely watched cloud business, Amazon Web Services, collected $28.79 billion in sales, up 19% year over year. That was narrowly below the $28.84 billion analysts were projecting ahead of the report. Amazon's cloud business was brought into even greater focus by investors after rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) posted lower-than-expected cloud sales growth for their December quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, total operating income for Amazon came in at $21.2 billion. Analysts were looking for roughly $19 billion in operating income for the quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nAWS was Amazon's fastest-growing segment. Advertising sales grew 18% year over year to $17.3 billion. Subscription services, such as Amazon Prime, grew 10% to $11.5 billion. Third-party seller services revenue growth decelerated for a fourth consecutive quarter, coming in at 9% growth to total $47.5 billion. Amazon's online stores segment (e-commerce sales it makes directly) grew sales 7% to $75.6 billion.\n\nAmazon Stock Near Buy Zone\n\nAhead of the report, MarketSurge shows Amazon stock hovering within a 5% buy range above a 233 entry point from a flat-base pattern, based on its weekly chart.\n\nAmazon stock has gained roughly 8% so far this year after gaining 45% in 2024.\n\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows Amazon stock holds a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nUSPS Resumes Accepting Packages From China.

Analysts were expecting $158.5 billion, according to LSEG.\n\n\"This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact\" from foreign exchange rates, the company said. The impact amounts to $2.1 billion, or 1.5%, Amazon said.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index \u2014 which measures the greenback against a basket of rivals \u2014 hit its highest level in more than two years last month, ahead of President Donald Trump's inauguration. The dollar climbed steadily from late November through mid-January and has since fallen slightly.\n\nBased on Amazon's forecast, the company expects revenue growth of only 5% to 9% in the first quarter. At the low end of the range, that would mark the slowest growth on record. Amazon went public in 1997.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter rose 10% from $170 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nNet income almost doubled to $20 billion, or $1.86 per share, from $10.6 billion, or $1 a share, a year ago. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a cost-cutting campaign since late 2022. The company laid off more than 27,000 corporate employees in 2022 and 2023. Job cuts continued in 2024 and have stretched into this year.\n\nAmazon has been able to bolster profits by trimming expenses and through continued strength in the high-margin cloud business. Amazon's operating margin, the profit left after accounting for costs to run the business, climbed to 11.3% in the period from 11% in the prior quarter and 7.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSales in Amazon's cloud division were a hair below consensus estimates, but grew faster than the same quarter last year. Revenue increased 19% during the quarter compared with 13% growth a year ago. AWS still isn't growing as quickly as its competitors. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services at Microsoft rose 31%. Alphabet's cloud revenue was up 30%.\n\nAmazon's capital expenditures totaled $27.8 billion during the quarter, compared with $14.6 billion a year ago. The company has been pumping billions of dollars into data centers and equipment such as Nvidia processors to power its artificial intelligence products. The company is responding to increased competition in generative AI from rivals including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, as well as AI startup Anthropic, which counts Amazon among its investors.\n\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company expects to boost capital expenditures to $100 billion in 2025, up from spending of roughly $83 billion in 2024. Olsavsky said the jump in spending \"primarily relates to AWS, including to support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments.\"\n\nJassy highlighted the company's AI investments in the earnings release, including a new set of AI models, called Nova, and its homegrown Trainium chips.\n\n\"These benefits are often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment and we're excited to see what customers build,\" Jassy said in a statement.\n\nTech companies are under greater pressure from investors to prove their big AI spending is worthwhile, especially following the launch of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 model. DeepSeek claims it took only two months and less than $6 million to develop R1, which it says rivals OpenAI's o1. The announcement caught Wall Street and Silicon Valley by surprise, challenging the assumption that tech companies must spend heavily on chips and data centers in order to build cutting-edge AI models.\n\nAdvertising revenue increased 18% to $17.3 billion, as brands continue to spend heavily for prominent positioning on Amazon's app. In recent years, Amazon has emerged as one of the top digital ad companies, behind only Alphabet and Meta in the U.S.\n\nAs of Thursday's close, Amazon shares were up 9% for the year. They rose 44% in 2024, topping the Nasdaq, which gained 29%.\n\nWATCH: Amazon's Jamil Ghani on Prime's 2024 performance",

            "content": "Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.\n\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.\n\nBut the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates \u201can unusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates, it said.\n\nAmazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\n\nAmazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.\n\nAcross the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.\n\nSales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.\n\nAmazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.\n\n\u201cWe think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we\u2019re pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.\u201d\n\nJassy added during the call that Amazon, like many others, was \u201cimpressed\u201d by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.\n\nAmazon\u2019s quarterly report comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.\n\nTrump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.\n\nThe new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.\n\nAdditionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon\u2019s first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.",

Together with the reduction in the number of opportunities to advance their careers, some cited the company\u2019s cutbacks on projects like cashierless checking and telehealth and its requirement to return to the office five days a week.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Bloomberg, per the report, that the reduction in the number of managers \u201cimpacts a relatively small subset of employees and aims to increase our team members\u2019 ability to move fast, clarify and strengthen their sense of ownership, and drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most affects customers and the business. Each organization is determining the best way to reach this goal, and our internal surveys show that employee sentiment remains strong.\u201d\n\nJassy wrote in a message shared with Amazon\u2019s employees and posted online in September that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office as part of an effort to \u201coperate like the world\u2019s largest startup.\u201d\n\nIn the case of managers, Jassy said Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAmazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000.",

            "content": "There is consistent customer feedback that AI assistants are the most useful when users can interface with them within the productivity tools they already use on a daily basis, to avoid switching applications and context. Web applications like Amazon Q Business and Slack have become essential environments for modern AI assistant deployment. This post explores how diverse interfaces enhance user interaction, improve accessibility, and cater to varying preferences.\n\nBy offering seamless experiences across environments, organizations can increase user satisfaction and adoption rates. The assistant employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that integrates credible and authoritative sources within responses across these interfaces, bolstering trustworthiness and educational value. This multi-interface, RAG-powered approach not only strives to meet the flexibility demands of modern users, but also fosters a more informed and engaged user base, ultimately maximizing the assistant\u2019s effectiveness and reach. By combining RAG with multiple interfaces, the assistant delivers consistent, accurate, and contextually relevant information regardless of the user\u2019s preferred environment and productivity tools.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the application\u2019s architectural design.\n\nYou can find the complete code and the steps to deploy the solution in the GitHub repository.\n\nClick here to open the AWS console and follow along.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou must have the following prerequisites:\n\nActive AWS account\n\nDocker installed\n\nThe AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed\n\nThe AWS CDK\n\nSlack workspace with the following: Parent channel \u2013 A public Slack channel where users will be interacting with the Slack assistant Child channel \u2013 A private Slack channel where metrics report will be sent to\n\n\n\nDeploy the solution\n\nFor the set-up steps, refer to the README in the GitHub repo.\n\nSolution components\n\nIn this section, we discuss two key components to the solution: the data sources and vector database.\n\nData sources\n\nWe use Spack documentation RST (ReStructured Text) files uploaded in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. Whenever the assistant returns it as a source, it will be a link in the specific portion of the Spack documentation and not the top of a source page. For example, Spack images on Docker Hub.\n\nSpack is a versatile package manager for supercomputers, Linux, and macOS that revolutionizes scientific software installation by allowing multiple versions, configurations, environments, and compilers to coexist on a single machine. Developed by Todd Gamblin at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2013, Spack addresses the limitations of traditional package managers in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Brian Weston, Cloud Transformation for Mission Science Program Lead at LLNL, advised in the development of this assistant.\n\nAdditionally, we use text files uploaded to an S3 bucket that is accessible through an Amazon CloudFront link. There is also an automated ingestion job from Slack conversation data to the S3 bucket powered by an AWS Lambda function. This enables the assistant to also use previous conversations from users to answer questions and cite its sources. We opted to use CloudFront links as opposed to using Slack links because when this source is cited in Amazon Q, the user might not have access to the Slack data. There is also an alternative to this methodology using the Slack connector for Amazon Kendra.\n\nThis solution could support other data types such as PDFs, Word documents, and more as long as their text can be extracted and fed into the vector database with some code changes. Their raw files can be served in a CloudFront distribution.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates a sample CloudFront URL.\n\nUpon deployment, existing data is automatically uploaded into an S3 bucket and processed to be used by the assistant. The solution also includes automatic daily ingestion of data from Slack into the application using Amazon EventBridge.\n\nVector database\n\nThis solution uses Amazon Kendra as its vector database, offering significant advantages in simplicity and cost-effectiveness. As a fully managed AWS service, Amazon Kendra reduces both development and maintenance costs. Amazon Q, which supports two types of retrievers (native retriever and Amazon Kendra), is seamlessly integrated into this setup. By using Amazon Kendra, the solution efficiently employs the same retriever for both the Amazon Q and Slack interfaces. This approach not only streamlines the overall architecture but also provides a more consistent user experience across both environments. The result is a cohesive, cost-efficient system that maintains uniformity in information retrieval and presentation, regardless of the user\u2019s chosen interface.\n\nAmazon Kendra also supports the use of metadata for each source file, which enables both UIs to provide a link to its sources, whether it is the Spack documentation website or a CloudFront link. Furthermore, Amazon Kendra supports relevance tuning, enabling boosting certain data sources. For this solution, we boosted the results for the Spack documentation.\n\nUser interfaces\n\nIn this section, we discuss the UIs used in this solution.\n\nAmazon Q Business\n\nAmazon Q Business uses RAG to offer a secure, knowledge-enhanced AI assistant tailored to your organization. As an AWS native solution, it seamlessly integrates with other AWS services and features its own user-friendly interface. This integration, combined with its straightforward setup and deployment process, provides a smooth implementation experience. By fusing generative AI capabilities with intelligent information retrieval from your enterprise systems, Amazon Q Business delivers precise, context-aware responses firmly rooted in your organization\u2019s specific data and documents, enhancing its relevance and accuracy.\n\nThe following screenshot is an example of the Amazon Q Business UI.\n\nSlack\n\nSlack is a popular collaboration service that has become an integral part of many organizations\u2019 communication forums. Its versatility extends beyond team messaging to serve as an effective interface for assistants. By integrating AI-powered assistants into Slack, companies can use its familiar environment to provide users with instant access to information.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of the Slack UI with a message thread.\n\nMonitoring\n\nAmazon Q has a built-in feature for an analytics dashboard that provides insights into user engagement within a specific Amazon Q Business application environment. It offers valuable data on usage patterns, conversation dynamics, user feedback, and query trends, allowing you to analyze and optimize your AI assistant\u2019s performance and user interaction.\n\nFor Slack, we are collecting user feedback, as shown in the preceding screenshot of the UI. Users can add a \u201cthumbs up\u201d or a \u201cthumbs down\u201d to the assistant response to keep track of its performance. Furthermore, we have built a custom solution that uses an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard to mimic the Amazon Q analytics dashboard to further align the experience between the two applications.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of the Slack CloudWatch dashboard.\n\nIn addition, there is a daily scheduled Slack message that summarizes the Slackbot data for the past day, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nClean up\n\nTo avoid incurring ongoing charges, clean up the resources you created as part of this post with the command mentioned in the readme.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe implementation of a multi-interface AI assistant using RAG represents a leap in AI-driven organizational communication. By integrating Amazon Q Business and Slack interfaces with a robust backend powered by Amazon Kendra, this solution offers seamless, environment-agnostic access to accurate, context-aware information. The architecture\u2019s strengths lie in its consistency across environments, automatic data ingestion processes, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities. This approach not only enhances user engagement and productivity, but also positions organizations to adapt swiftly to evolving communication needs in an increasingly AI-centric landscape, marking a pivotal step towards more efficient and intelligent information management systems.\n\nTo learn more about the AWS services used in this solution, refer to the Amazon Q User Guide, Deploy a Slack gateway for Amazon Bedrock, and the Amazon Kendra Developer Guide.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nNick Biso is a Machine Learning Engineer at AWS Professional Services.

In 2011, the company let paying users access 5,000 films and TV shows, kickstarting what we know today as Prime Video; it launched Prime Music in 2014; teamed up with GrubHub to offer subscribers free food delivery in 2022; and obviously still provides its all-important same- and next-day delivery service. For better or worse, it\u2019s become a subscription that many Americans choose not to live without.\n\nPrime numbers\n\nAccording to estimates from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the number of US shoppers who use Prime \u2014 not paid subscribers, just those who access a membership \u2014 hit a record 194 million by the end of 2024. The stat\u2019s made even more impressive by the fact that just two years ago, the same firm declared that subscribers to Amazon\u2019s flagship service were plateauing, a charge that Amazon publicly disputed at the time.\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t commented on this latest release from CIRP, but then, why would it? The 194 million figure would mean that over 75% of US adults were using Prime in 2024, per Census Bureau data \u2014 a pretty healthy market share by anyone\u2019s standards.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Amazon will be the first of America's major retailers to report fourth-quarter earnings when it posts results after markets close on Thursday.\n\nAfter a record-breaking holiday shopping season, analysts expect retailers to report strong sales.\n\nConsumer spending growth is expected to accelerate this year, but analysts warn tariffs and a stock market downturn could curb momentum.\n\nAmazon will kick off the earnings reporting season for major retailers this week, offering investors a snapshot of consumer spending in the wake of a blockbuster holiday season.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, followed by Walmart (WMT) on February 20. Costco (COST) and Target (TGT) are both slated to report in early March.\n\nRetailers are likely to report strong sales after a record-breaking holiday shopping season that exceeded expectations, said Mark Matthews, executive director of research at the National Retail Federation.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsumers remain engaged,\u201d Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach said on the company's earnings call last week, according to a transcript from AlphaSense. \u201cAffluent consumers have benefited from the wealth effect, while the mass segment remains supported by the labor market.\u201d\n\nSales are expected to rise slightly in 2025, but analysts warn tariffs or a stock market correction could curb the momentum.\n\nWhat Analysts Expect From the Big Retailers This Year\n\nUBS analysts estimate Amazon, Walmart, and Costco accounted for 40-50% of all retail sales growth (excluding automobiles) in the past year.\n\nOnline shopping has gained ground as Americans have hunted for bargains and convenience. Amazon moved more merchandise than ever during its main holiday sale, and appears poised for a 10% year-over-year increase in the value of goods sold on its platform in 2025, UBS analysts said.\n\nWalmart has also made shopping more convenient by expanding its delivery service, which has attracted high-income households, executives said last quarter. Granted, the chain still appeals to bargain-hunters, and consumers\u2019 search for value could help Walmart achieve a 2-4% year-over-year increase in same-store sales in 2025, UBS said.\n\nCostco has been ramping up its e-commerce business, and its long-time focus on value is resonating with consumers, UBS analysts said. They project that same-store sales at the wholesale club could grow 3.8-5.8% in 2025.\n\nDiscounts have been playing a big role in driving sales at Target, the company said in November. Consumer pullbacks can be a challenge for Target, which stocks fewer essential items than some of its counterparts. But UBS said the replacement cycle for discretionary items may benefit Target, which could report flat to 3% growth in same-store sales this year, according to its estimates.\n\nWhat Factors Are at Play?\n\nConsumers are estimated to have spent about 2% more on goods in 2024 than in 2023, and are expected to increase their expenditures another 2.5% this year, according to a UBS forecast.\n\nUBS analysts argue conditions are favorable for robust spending: Inflation has moderated, while the job market remains stable and stocks have gained value. They expect tax cuts, reduced government spending and deregulation under the Trump administration, could accelerate economic growth and, subsequently, \u201csupercharge\u201d apparel and shoe sales.\n\nBut a range of outcomes, including a drop in retail spending, are possible. Tariffs broadly imposed on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada could have \u201cmeaningful consequences,\" adding 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points to inflation over the following three to four months, analysts at Morgan Stanley said. They estimate that could ultimately halve the rate of consumer spending growth in 2025.\n\nA correction in the stock market is another risk, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, who estimated appreciation of equity investments drove about one-third of consumer spending growth last year.\n\n",

Before I found this desk solution, I would feel drained from staying in one position all day. Something had to change.\n\nWhen I started my search for an electric standing desk, I knew I only needed something basic that would fit in my small office and not cost a fortune\u2014and I found the perfect fit with this . After using it for months now, I can't stress enough how much it's changed my work-from-home life for the better.\n\nEasy to Assemble Huanuo Electric Standing Desk $160 at Amazon Credit: Huanuo\n\nHere's why I love it:\n\nThe Price Can't Be Beat\n\nIf spending $500 to $1,000 on an electric standing desk is not in the cards for you, follow in my footsteps and try this Huanuo desk. The price is so right, I even got one for my husband. Even better, it often goes on sale, so I paid $119 instead of $160 for one in November of 2024. (Spoiler alert: It's on sale now, too!)\n\nNot to mention that I immediately liked the wood-grain options (solid black or white was not going to work in my office) and size variety.\n\nIt's Easy to Assemble\n\nThe assembly instructions are clear (see and check out the on Amazon), and all of the tools you'll need are included. The only tool of my own I used was an electric screwdriver, but any Phillips head screwdriver should work just as well. It only took me a little over an hour to build the base, hook up the motor and control panel, and attach the desktop to the base. I plugged it in, and it worked like a dream.\n\nIt's Easy to Use\n\nA control panel on the desk lets you move it up or down to the exact height you need, but it also has four memory buttons for saving your preferred settings. I have two of mine set at my favorite standing and sitting heights for quick changes. The desk rises up to 46.5 inches, which is plenty for me and my husband (I'm 5'1\", he's 6')\u2014but if you're taller, you may find that this desk doesn't rise high enough for you.\n\nAlso of note: Because the desk is electric, you need access to a wall socket. The cord is over six feet long, though, so I still personally felt like I had a lot of options for where to place the desk.\n\nIs the Huanuo Amazon Standing Desk Worth It?\n\nAbsolutely. It's an undeniably reasonable price, looks great in my home office, is easy to put together\u2014and most of all, it's changing my work-from-home life.\n\nI usually start my day by checking emails standing up while I have my coffee. When I'm writing and need to concentrate\u2014or if I'm in a meeting\u2014I tend to sit. As the afternoon goes on, if I feel my back and legs getting stiff, I stand at my new desk for 15 to 30 minutes, which allows me to stretch my lower body and help my circulation. It even helps my posture, since it forces me to stop slumping down in my office chair. I always feel better and more focused afterwards.\n\nIn short: I consider this desk to be not just an investment in my home office decor, but also in my overall health.",

Prime costs about $180 per year if paid in monthly installments or about $140 if paid annually.\n\n\u201cI do believe it is a fact that Amazon's delivery speeds are increasing, but so is the cost of Prime,\u201d Rick Watson, founder and CEO of RMW Commerce, said by email, adding that the company is keen on reminding its Prime customers of the value of their membership.\n\nThe e-commerce giant in recent years has beefed up its fulfillment network. In 2023, its worldwide shipping costs rose over 7%, approaching $90 billion. Much of that investment has gone toward Amazon\u2019s effort to speed up delivery times for its U.S. Prime members. Last year, the company expanded its number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% and now serves more than 140 metro areas.\n\nAmazon has also pulled out of some areas. In December, Washington, D.C.\u2019s attorney general office sued the e-commerce giant, saying it \u201cdeliberately \u2014 and secretly \u2014 stopped providing its fastest delivery service to the nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in historically underserved communities east of the Anacostia River,\u201d in violation of the city\u2019s Consumer Protection Procedures Act. Amazon refuted that, saying that it adjusted delivery routes and times to protect drivers and that it is always transparent about delivery times.\n\nMore broadly, Amazon these days seems to be prioritizing AI over its sellers and retail business, even as competition is rising, according to Watson.\n\n\u201cWhat Amazon really needs to worry about long term is the growth of its marketplace itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this new world, Walmart is growing much faster than Amazon and has the resources and scale to compete with it.\u201d",

And now, Amazon Prime offers 300 million items across 35 categories with tens of millions of items that can be delivered the same or next day. In 2024, Amazon delivered more than 9 billion items during that time frame, the Seattle-based retailer said.\n\nPrime customers worldwide also saved nearly $95 billion on delivery costs; the average U.S. Prime customer saved $500 a year on shipping costs, Jamil Ghani, VP of Amazon Prime, who leads the Prime program globally, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview.\n\nWhat is Amazon Prime?\n\nFor $14.99 a month or $139 a year, customers in the U.S. can join Prime. That gives customers access to free delivery on eligible items. Prime has also increased its other perks for members, Ghani said.\n\nSome highlights include exclusive access to shopping events like Prime Day and other perks such as a 10-cent discount off a gallon of gas at select Amoco, AM/PM and BP gas stations, as well as free delivery on certain Grubhub+ orders . Prime members also have access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos and online and in-store discounts at Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. There are also prescription savings via Amazon Pharmacy.\n\nSign up for Amazon Prime\n\nAmazon doesn't disclose how many U.S. Prime customers it has, but Ghani said there are more than 200 million Prime members worldwide in 24 countries and every continent but Antarctica.\n\nThe average U.S. Prime customer placed nearly 100 orders last year \u2013 or nearly two orders every week.\n\nHow has Amazon Prime changed in 20 years?\n\nThere are now 20 times more selections that can be delivered twice as fast since Amazon Prime started in 2005, Ghani said.\n\n\"We find that really earns more and more of a busy household's mind share and shopping share,\" Ghani said, referring to a term in marketing for what brand comes to mind first for a customer. \"You can just count on Prime for so many additional things than back in 2005, which was a game-changer then, and we like to feel like we're raising the bar every single day.\"\n\nAmazon has increased its availability and delivery speeds by investing in its network and regionalizing its network, putting inventory closer to customers, Ghani said.\n\nA particular focus for Amazon is to have \"household everyday essentials\" and pantry items, such as diapers, available quickly for consumers, he said. Last year, more than 2 billion \"everyday essentials\" items were delivered within the same day or the next day.\n\nThat was a 50% increase from the previous year's performance, Ghani said. That category is growing 90% faster than other segments of the Amazon Prime store offerings, he said.\n\nThe company's same-day network also has been expanded and now serves more than 140 metro areas in the U.S., an increase of more than 60% in 2024, he said.\n\nAmazon has taken Prime in the past 20 years \"from a service focused on delivery to a membership scheme that provides a whole host of benefits,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at the research and analytics firm GlobalData.\n\n\"Delivery is still important to members of Prime \u2013 and most people make their annual fee back on the savings they make from free shipping \u2013 but a lot of subscribers take advantage of other features like movie and TV content,\" Saunders told USA TODAY. \"Amazon has created the most compelling membership program in retail, which is why it has so many subscribers and high loyalty rates.\n\n\"There are a lot more imitations out there these days, but none of them have the firepower of Amazon Prime, which means it will still be relevant over the years ahead.\"\n\nWhat are the benefits of having Amazon Prime?\n\nThe free shipping benefits are usually what initially get consumers to subscribe to Amazon Prime, and the entertainment offerings keep consumers engaged and subscribed, said Douglas Bowman, a marketing professor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Georgia. Bowman researches consumer behavior and brand and product management.\n\nMost Prime members don\u2019t fully realize all the benefits they have access to, Bowman told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Many consumers feel they are getting enough value from shipping alone and overlook additional benefits or don\u2019t regularly check for added updates or perks,\" he said. \"Amazon doesn\u2019t always make salient many of the benefits that may be valued by only a subset of members.\"\n\nNo cashiers: What is Amazon's Just Walk Out technology at some retail locations?\n\nFor consumers, Amazon Prime combines shopping, entertainment and everyday essentials into one seamless experience, Bowman said.\n\n\"It\u2019s addicting and becomes part a consumer\u2019s everyday life,\" he said.\n\nStill, over-reliance on Prime could mean consumers \"may not fully research offerings from other retailers and miss out on better deals or other products that better meet their needs,\" Bowman said. \"In the long run, there are concerns of reduced competition in e-commerce that will lead to higher prices and reduced offerings.\"\n\nPrime also can encourage overspending by consumers, he said.\n\n\"The convenience of fast and free shipping may mean more impulse purchases. The algorithms encourage add-on purchases that can lead to unnecessary spending,\" he said. And with any subscription service, there is always a concern that a consumer is not using the service frequently enough to make it worthwhile but forgets to cancel, Bowman said.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Following the fieldwork abroad, they will draft research papers this spring, concluding with a presentation to the Law School community.\n\nAccording to S\u00e1nchez, Indigenous peoples\u2019 global activism has led to notable achievements, such as the adoption of the U.N.

That prompted some employees to ask about this ahead of the meeting in late January with Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, the vice president of technology at Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe question about DEI received the highest interest among employees, Tomsen Bukovec said, according to a meeting transcript obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe AWS executive said she wasn't aware of the changes to Amazon's DEI websites. She said she asked internally to ensure that Amazon was still committed to its DEI programs. The feedback she received was \"no change,\" she said.\n\n\"We are not pulling back on DEI initiatives. I looked at all the changes. We are not making any changes to any of the benefits,\" Tomsen Bukovec added. \"There's no change to the commitment, but we didn't roll it out that well.\"\n\nTomsen Bukovec, who's been at AWS for almost 15 years, is a senior, high-profile executive at the cloud division. She often speaks on behalf of the company at public events and was one of the speakers at last year's re:Invent conference. In 2023, Tomsen Bukovec was included in BI's AI 100 list.\n\nOther companies, including Meta, Target, and McDonald's, have pulled back or ended DEI programs in recent months as pressure from conservative activists and Donald Trump's administration increased. At the same time, other companies, such as JPMorgan and Costco, are continuing support for DEI.\n\nMedia reports in recent months have suggested Amazon's approach to DEI may be changing.\n\nIn December, Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, said the company was shutting down several \"outdated\" DEI programs to focus on those with \"proven outcomes,\" according to Bloomberg. Amazon also recently removed or changed some words about its DEI benefits on some of its websites, The Information previously reported.\n\nDuring the late January staff meeting, Tomsen Bukovec said Amazon consolidated some words and dropped some paragraphs from its DEI websites and blogs. But the company \"didn't change the underlying capabilities that people can do, and we did not change any of the commitment that we have to the programs,\" she said.\n\nShe specifically addressed a transgender benefit that Amazon offers and said, \"We are not making any changes to that.\"\n\n\"We just made some changes to the words, and then I think we deprioritized one or two programs that were not making much of a difference anyway,\" she added.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of this story but shared a link to the company's policy positions that show its commitment \"to creating a diverse and inclusive\" culture.\n\nThe spokesperson also shared a copy of Castleberry's December email that said, \"We remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon?

            "content": "This is a guest post written by Francesco Ongaro, Piero Ciffolillo, Alessandro Dovico and Matteo Lanati of Storm Reply and Marcello Tava and Toaha Umar of BMW Group.\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) and data visualization are vital for making quick, informed decisions. They provide insights and visibility into processes, performance, costs, and customer behavior, enabling businesses to adapt swiftly to market changes and improve operational efficiency across various areas.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple and diverse traditional on-premise solutions can often hinder innovation due to slow functional evolution, data fragmentation, scalability issues, and high maintenance and licensing costs.\n\nTo address these challenges, the BMW Group is continuously exploring cloud-native BI solutions. By adopting these tools, the BMW Group aims at overcoming the obstacles posed by traditional systems and solving scalability and operating cost issues.\n\nIn this post, AWS premier consulting partner Storm Reply and the BMW Group share how they collaborated to migrate BMW Group\u2019s traditional on-premises BI tools to Amazon QuickSight. By using advanced code automation, generative AI, and an AWS serverless architecture, the team simplified the BMW Group\u2019s BI processes, reduced manual efforts, and achieved scalability. The post outlines the specific challenges encountered during the migration and explains how they were overcome through a collaborative approach, using cloud-centered solutions.\n\nThe results of the pilot, achieved in just 6 weeks, highlighted the potential of the solution as a standard migration tool. This led the BMW Group to extend its cooperation with Storm Reply to industrialize the solution at scale.\n\nKey challenges in the migration process\n\nBMW Group faced the significant task of migrating a very large number of on-premises dashboards. Transitioning traditional BI tools to a modern, cloud-centered, fully managed solution like QuickSight requires substantial effort and expertise.\n\nKey challenges include manual data transformation, converting dashboards and functionalities (such as calculated fields) between different tools, and providing a smooth transition without disrupting ongoing operations while maintaining a similar user experience.\n\nStreamlined migration to QuickSight for enhanced BI\n\nFor this pilot, we selected a number of dashboards hosted on an internal BMW Group data exchange platform for business analysts This platform is visited by more than 10,000 unique internal BMW Group employees yearly and contains more than 100 dashboards. It is currently based on Tableau on-premises servers.\n\nThe pilot goals were to demonstrate that following aspects:\n\nThe user experience would be adequate and similar to Tableau\n\nThe solution would offer a high level of automation to enable large-scale migration\n\nManual code conversion would be minimal, facilitated by an upfront complexity analysis report, thanks to generative AI\n\nThe solution would be generic enough to be applied to other BI tools in the future\n\nTo achieve these goals, we began to define a modular approach, described later in this post, that addresses the main challenges. We developed conversion libraries and scripts to automate most tasks, using generative AI to assess the complexity of the transformation and translate tool-specific configurations that would otherwise require significant manual effort. Our goal was to create an automated, agnostic solution that could be scaled and evolved to accommodate other BI tools besides Tableau.\n\nSolution overview\n\nWe started by designing a migration workflow, keeping in mind the importance of defining a block strategy, useful for future evolutions.\n\nThe workflow, depicted in the following diagram, begins with the export of a Tableau file describing the component of a dashboard.\n\nThe file is then analyzed by our generative AI complexity analysis tool, which estimates the time it takes a developer to perform the relevant manual transformation tasks. This is important to understand how much time and resources we could save through this automated solution.\n\nThe next step is automation, where the conversion from Tableau to QuickSight takes place.\n\nThe QuickSight API is invoked by passing the results obtained in the previous step.\n\nFinally, the dashboards are ready and available in QuickSight and can be audited by the end-user.\n\nComplexity analysis\n\nWithin the complexity analysis component, described in the following diagram, we developed a parsing script that takes the Tableau file and extracts all the parameters of a specific dashboard, such as how many charts are present, the type of charts, the number of fields calculated, and so on.\n\nThe results are stored in a JSON file that is then sent to a large language model (LLM) along with appropriate prompts. The result of the complexity analysis tool is a complexity report.\n\nThe solution is based on Amazon Bedrock, and we used Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM family.\n\nAutomation\n\nThe automation component consists of two different streams, as shown in the following diagram. The first stream, at the top, starts parsing and analyzing the Tableau file and extracts relevant information about the main components, such as charts, labels, colors, and more.\n\nThe results are fed into an intermediate file, which we designed. This allows us to have a solution agnostic to BI platforms, which can be used in the future to translate other different BI tools. From there the intermediate file is processed by an analysis script that creates a QuickSight model.\n\nThis model is then merged with the result from the lower branch, where the Tableau input functions reside, which are language-specific expressions used to change the appearance of the dashboard.\n\nThe resulting data flows into an LLM that performs a crucial task: translating the calculated fields from Tableau to QuickSight, because they use a different syntactic language.\n\nFinally, the results of the combinations between the QuickSight calculated fields and the analysis model are sent to the QuickSight API, which creates all the dashboards with their filters, labels, colors, and so on.\n\nPilot migration outcomes and insights\n\nDuring this pilot, we focused on five types of graphs using anonymized infotainment data from the BMW Group:\n\nLine chart\n\nHorizontal bar chart\n\nVertical bar chart\n\nTable chart\n\nMap chart\n\nAfter developing the components outlined in the previous sections, we executed our migration workflow. The results of the conversion are illustrated in the following figures, where we compare the initial dashboard (on the left) with the QuickSight dashboard (on the right), which was automatically generated by our solution. All data displayed is examples or mock-up data without real meaning.\n\n\n\nTableau Line Chart QuickSight Line Chart\n\n(Automatically Generated)\n\nTableau Horizontal Bar Chart\n\nQuickSight Horizontal Bar Chart\n\n(Automatically Generated)\n\nTableau Vertical Bar Chart QuickSight Vertical Bar Chart\n\n(Automatically Generated)\n\nTableau Table Chart QuickSight Table Chart (Automatically Generated)\n\nTableau Map Chart\n\nQuickSight Map Chart (Automatically Generated)\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nAt this stage, the joint team of Storm Reply and BMW Group aims to expand the range of chart types available, improve complexity analysis, and enhance accuracy through generative AI, covering complex data correlation and transformation, making migrations even more efficient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe pilot project, conducted over 6 weeks, successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of automating the migration of traditional BI dashboards to QuickSight. By using advanced automation scripting and generative AI, we achieved a significant reduction in migration efforts, up to 80%, compared to traditional manual methods. This approach enabled us to convert complex data visualizations and charts from existing BI tools into the specific syntax and format required by QuickSight, achieving a high preservation rate of 90% of the original data after conversion without manual intervention.\n\nThe complexity analysis tool played a key role in estimating migration efforts, enabling informed planning and resource allocation. By identifying potential challenges early, we improved the overall efficiency of the project. In addition, the insights gained from this analysis are critical in defining an accurate business case for this type of project, providing valuable data to assess its feasibility.\n\nOverall, this project highlights the transformative potential of combining automation and generative AI in modernizing BI processes, enabling organizations to use data more effectively and make informed decisions quickly.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nFrancesco Ongaro is a Senior Manager and Business Unit Manager at Storm Reply, based in Munich, Germany.

            "content": "We've invested in more than 230 solar and wind projects across Europe to date, bringing new carbon-free energy sources to local grids and helping match the electricity consumed by our operations. The investment brings us another step closer to our Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040.\n\nThe total portfolio of European projects will provide an estimated 9 gigawatts (GW) of new carbon-free energy capacity in the region, and is expected to generate enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 6.7 million European homes annually. The projects include more than 100 utility-scale solar, wind, and offshore wind farms across the region, as well as onsite solar arrays on more than 100 buildings that host our operations.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the amount of renewable energy on Europe\u2019s electricity grids is the fastest and cheapest way to help Europe\u2019s economy decarbonize at scale and fight against climate change,\u201d said Lindsay McQuade, Director of Energy for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at Amazon. \u201cAs Europe\u2019s top corporate investor in renewable energy, we will continue to work with governments, industry and communities to unlock more of Europe\u2019s renewable energy potential.\u201d\n\nBringing new renewable energy sources to Europe\n\nAmazon has invested in 26 renewable energy projects and 20 onsite installations in Europe in 2024.\n\n\n\nSpain : 15 new utility-scale solar and wind farms and two onsite solar installations.\n\n: 15 new utility-scale solar and wind farms and two onsite solar installations.

According to the developer, the \u20ac350 million project will create over 700 jobs at the peak of construction. The wind complex is sited next to the T\u00e2mega hydroelectric complex and is the largest hybridisation project in the country, designed to make use of the grid connection point already built at the site.\n\nIn Spain, we've now invested in a total of 94 renewable energy projects. One of our new PPAs will help enable the Ciudad Rodrigo solar project near Salamanca in western Spain. With an investment of close to \u20ac200 million by the developer, the project is expected to create more than 800 jobs during peak construction periods. As part of the project, Iberdrola has committed to the Ciudad Rodrigo municipality to help restore the Plaza Amayuelas town square to make it a space for the whole community to enjoy.\n\nIn Greece, we recently joined the Greek Minister of Environment and Energy and the National Bank of Greece to announce a collaboration supporting three new utility-scale wind farms, which will be located in the Western and Central Macedonia regions, and the Peloponnese region. In Poland, Amazon agreed to purchase energy from two wind farms located in Jastrowie and Okonek, in Wielkopolskie Voivodeship.\n\nSupporting local communities\n\nIn 2023, Amazon met its goal to match 100% of the electricity consumed in its operations with renewable energy, seven years ahead of our original target. Amazon has now invested in enough renewable energy projects globally to power the equivalent of 24.6 million European homes. The renewable energy projects supported not only help match the electricity used by our own operations, but also provide new sources of carbon-free energy to the local communities where Amazon\u2019s customers, vendors and employees live and work. The projects also help create jobs, support local businesses, and boost the local economy, which are all part of Amazon\u2019s commitment to become a more sustainable company.\n\nTo learn more about Amazon\u2019s broader carbon-free energy strategy, click here.",

            "content": "MSG Networks is the oldest RSN in the US\n\nCarriage disputes have affected revenue streams\n\nDebts believed to be up to US$829m\n\nMSG Networks, the regional sports network (RSN) operated by New York Knicks owner James Dolan, is reportedly nearing a deal with Amazon to save it from bankruptcy.\n\nThe channel is the oldest RSN in existence and airs local broadcasts for the NBA\u2019s Knicks and the NHL\u2019s New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils.\n\nIt is currently owned by Sphere Entertainment, an MSG-owned subsidiary previously known as MSG Entertainment (MSGE), that serves as a sister company to MSG Sports, the holding company that owns both the Knicks and the Rangers.\n\nHowever, MSG Networks is saddled with debts of up to US$829 million. Creditors, including JPMorgan, have extended payment deadlines on several occasions, however the New York Post reports that the aim now is for MSG Networks to restructure its liabilities rather than seek another extension.\n\nWith Dolan not indicating any willingness to step in himself, The New York Post says the most likely outcome is outside investment in exchange for a stake in the business, with Amazon a possible suitor.\n\nAmazon already has a distribution deal with Main Street Sports, formerly known as Diamond Sports Group (DSG), which operates the FanDuel TV network of RSNs. It also has a stake in another New York RSN, YES Network, allowing it to air selected local broadcasts involving Major League Baseball\u2019s New York Yankees.\n\nMSG Networks is currently embroiled in a carriage dispute with Altice\u2019s Optimum cable platform, meaning up to one million households in the New York area currently don\u2019t have access to the service. Meanwhile Comcast \u2018s Xfinity cable platform hasn\u2019t carried the channel since 2021.\n\nThe subsequent reduction in carriage fees is exacerbating longer term structural challenges affecting all RSNs, as evidenced by Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s (WBD) exit from the market and Main Street\u2019s well-documented spell in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nRSNs have traditionally been one of the main beneficiaries of the cable bundle, which sees consumers pay for a collection of channels rather than picking and choosing which services they want to receive.\n\nCable providers pay the RSN a fee regardless of whether the customer wants the channel or not, which means a steady, reliable stream of revenues. However, as more consumers ditch cable for streaming services, RSNs are disproportionately affected.\n\nFalling subscriber numbers make it more difficult for RSNs to honour expensive rights agreements that were struck during an era where cable was dominant and streaming wasn\u2019t a factor.\n\nMSG Networks is already one of the most expensive RSNs on the market and is seeking greater carriage fees to compensate for lower viewership, something which has led to its disputes with major cable providers.\n\nSeveral RSNs have launched direct to consumer (DTC) streaming services to attract cord-cutters, including MSG Networks. MSG+ went live in 2023 and is now part of Gotham Sports App, a combined platform that also includes YES Network.\n\nHowever streaming offers a less reliable source of revenue given DTC services must actively attract and retain subscribers, and involves significant expenses in technology, marketing and customer service. The Post reports that MSG Networks\u2019 DTC products have not yet attracted a large subscriber base, making carriage fees all the more important.\n\nShould MSG Networks be unable to find a solution, then its creditors could take control and seek to use bankruptcy as an opportunity to renegotiate contracts with the Knicks and Rangers. It\u2019s also possible that Dolan himself could agree to lower the two teams\u2019 demands as part of a restructure.",

In AWS\u2019s case, that means giving its business customers access to a wide range of AI models to utilize, now including DeepSeek\u2019s R1, which is an open-source model.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune on Friday, shortly after Amazon announced multiple ways that business could begin testing the R1 model natively through its cloud computing arm, AWS director Ankur Mehrotra made the case that R1\u2019s out-of-nowhere rise is exactly the type of occurrence that AWS\u2019 AI approach is built for.\n\n\u201cOur whole strategy when we started building our Gen AI capabilities\u2026 was that 'Hey, we think that no one model will be sufficient to meet all customers needs' \u2026 we're seeing that it has proven to be true.\u201d\n\nTold by this reporter that Amazon leaders seem to be enjoying a bit of a victory lap -- AWS CEO Matt Garman also promoted the company's AI strategy in LinkedIn posts this week -- Mehrotra smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s victory for customers,\u201d he quipped.\n\nBut a reality check will arrive in the next week, when Amazon reports its fourth-quarter financial results on February 6. Last quarter, AWS posted its largest quarterly operating profit in its history even amid massive investments in Gen AI infrastructure. AWS\u2019s operating margin was boosted two percentage points in the quarter by an accounting change related to how Amazon judges the useful life of its data centers. Another contributor to expanded margins in AWS was a more \u201cmeasured\u201d pace in hiring.\n\nAs of Thursday, AWS customers could start accessing R1 through AWS Bedrock Marketplace, which offers a choice of more than 100 foundation models, large and small, for both generalized and specialized use cases. The service includes the ability to deploy the model with guardrails to help businesses guard against the model spewing outputs that may include unsafe or inappropriate content. Earlier in the week, others, including the AI chipmaker Cerebras, began offering the model, hosted on US servers, to enterprises. And on Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satay Nadella, said that its Azure could service would offer DeepSeek to customers.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "Brazilian Amazon states are leading an offensive against environmental regulations in the Amazon and beyond.\n\nThe movement gained momentum in October when Brazil\u2019s granary, Mato Grosso state, approved a bill undermining a voluntary agreement to protect the Amazon from soy expansion.\n\nBefore Mato Grosso, other Amazon states like Acre and Rond\u00f4nia had already approved bills reducing protected areas and weakening the fight against illegal mining.\n\nWith its economy highly reliant on agribusiness, Mato Grosso is considered a successful model for other parts of the Amazon. See All Key Ideas\n\nIn effect for the past 18 years, the soy moratorium seemed established in Brazil. The voluntary agreement in which large soy traders commit to not buying soy from Amazon areas deforested after 2008 had helped to maintain the country\u2019s reputation in international markets. According to the Brazilian Vegetable Oil Industries Association (Abiove), which gathers some of the world\u2019s largest soy companies, this commitment contributed to a 69% reduction in deforestation until 2022.\n\nIn 2024, however, the agreement suffered an unexpected setback. In July, Rond\u00f4nia state approved a law punishing its members by withdrawing their fiscal tax incentives. The biggest strike, however, came in October, when a similar law was approved in Mato Grosso. Known as \u201cBrazil\u2019s granary,\u201d the state in the west-central region is the country\u2019s largest soy, cotton, corn and beef producer.\n\n\u201cOur country is sovereign, and no company can break our environmental laws, which are the most restrictive in the world,\u201d Governor Mauro Mendes said when sanctioning the new law, arguing the moratorium was undermining Brazil\u2019s environmental legislation. A similar bill has also been filed in the Brazilian Congress, threatening the moratorium on a national level. According to The Guardian, the offensive made Abiove evaluate changes to soften the agreement \u2014 in a WhatsApp message to Mongabay, the organization\u2019s PR person said it wouldn\u2019t comment.\n\n\u201cMato Grosso has always been a great laboratory,\u201d said Edilene Fernandes do Amaral, the legal adviser of the civil society network Observa-MT, which advocates for environmental protection in the state, referring to controversial initiatives born in the region and replicated in other parts of Brazil.\n\nIn early January, Mato Grosso\u2019s deputies approved a bill redefining Amazon areas, where landowners must protect 80% of the property, as Cerrado areas, where the required preservation area falls to 35%. According to Observa-MT, it could lead to deforestation in 5.2 million hectares (12.8 million acres), an area larger than Slovakia. The law was vetoed by the Governor, but the issue is not over. According to the Brazilian news outlet ((o))eco, Mendes agreed with lawmakers and agribusiness representatives to discuss alternatives to the bill.\n\n\u201cThe law applies to the transition area between the two biomes, which is in the north of the state,\u201d L\u00fadio Cabral, a Mato Grosso state deputy who opposes the environmental setbacks, told Mongabay. \u201cThis is exactly where the \u2018arc of deforestation\u2019 is, where most forest fires occur and where there are many agrarian conflicts.\u201d\n\nMato Grosso soy producers are also notable critics of the European Union anti-deforestation law, fueling a campaign that managed to postpone it. The legislation forbids EU buyers from importing goods produced in recently cleared areas.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely at the opposite end of the global debate,\u201d Cabral said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lack of intelligence. If we continue with this exploitation model, in 10 or 20 years, we will have a serious problem of water scarcity that will jeopardize agribusiness activity itself.\u201d\n\nState-level siege\n\nMato Grosso is not alone in its counter-offensive. As international markets threatened to ban Brazilian products, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s administration sought to restore environmental protection after four years of intentional lockdown during the tenure of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), which favored agribusiness and supported deforestation. Lula\u2019s team resumed raids on the ground against environmental criminals, seized illegal cattle herds and destroyed illegal mining machinery. New legislation also made it harder to sell illegal gold, and the government increased fines against ranchers setting vegetation on fire.\n\nAs the siege increased, Amazonian states responded by passing controversial bills to undermine environmental control. Roraima and Rond\u00f4nia, for example, tried to forbid agents from destroying machinery used for environmental crimes. Also in Rond\u00f4nia, lawmakers and the local government are trying to scrap 11 conservation units and reduce two others.\n\nIn Acre state, a law approved in August allowed the privatization of an area approximately the size of New York City inside five Amazon conservation units. According to the Associated Press, deforestation in these areas more than tripled, thanks to the bill.\n\nIn Par\u00e1 state, lawmakers and ranchers started advocating for a change in the national Forest Code to grant amnesty to all deforestation made until 2020.\n\nThe powerful agribusiness lobby was also heard loud and clear in the National Congress, which approved two proposals from the so-called Destruction Package, a set of 28 measures pushed by the agribusiness caucus.\n\n\u201cThese proposals are being given a place they never had before,\u201d Suely Ara\u00fajo, public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory, a network of civil society organizations, told Mongabay. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-out attack.\u201d\n\nThe so-called Poison Bill, which slashes pesticide regulations, and the marco temporal (time frame) provision, which threatens the demarcation of Indigenous territories, have been signed into law, although the marco temporal bill is still under discussion in the Supreme Court.\n\nOther equally harmful bills may still be approved, like the one that withdraws protection on non-forestry vegetation and another one reducing the mandatory preservation area in rural properties, the so-called legal reserve.\n\n\u201cIt really is a very negative scenario,\u201d Ara\u00fajo said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that parliamentarians take a little more responsibility in what they vote on when it comes to protecting socioenvironmental rights.\u201d\n\nAn Amazonian dream\n\nFor many decades, Mato Grosso has been the destiny of small and impoverished peasants from other parts of Brazil \u2014 especially from the south \u2014 in search of larger chunks of land. The real agricultural revolution, however, happened in the 1980s, when large ranchers entered the scene counting on the government\u2019s technical assistance to improve soil conditions.\n\nToday, Mato Grosso\u2019s agriculture is based on expensive machinery, extensive use of pesticides and voluminous financing, with an economic strength that overflows to the political arena. \u201cIn the main cities of Mato Grosso and the state government, it is impossible to win an election without the support of agribusiness,\u201d political scientist Jo\u00e3o Edson, who lives in the state\u2019s capital, Cuiab\u00e1, told Mongabay.\n\nThanks to agribusiness, whole cities developed from zero, and Sinop, known as the \u201ccapital of the north,\u201d is the most symbolic. \u201cSinop is a center for health, education and business. The airport has daily direct flights to S\u00e3o Paulo and Bras\u00edlia, which are always full,\u201d Edson said.\n\nThese attributes make Mato Grosso a role model to other Amazonian states. \u201cThe municipalities in the north of Mato Grosso are our references,\u201d Novo Progresso\u2019s mayor, Gelson Dill, told Mongabay in his office in mid-October. \u201cIn Sorriso, Sinop, and Lucas do Rio Verde, the quality of life is very good because of soy, corn and agricultural production. We want that.\u201d\n\nHowever, people coming to Mato Grosso for wealth are often unqualified to work in the state\u2019s high-tech crops and face high living expenses. \u201cAt farm parties, it\u2019s very common for the ranch\u2019s airport to have 60, 70 aircraft parked. The farmers use the planes as if they were their cars,\u201d Edson said. \u201cBut if you go to the city\u2019s outskirts, the worker rides a bus.\u201d\n\nMato Grosso\u2019s development model also comes with a high environmental cost. The state is the only one in Brazil harboring three biomes \u2014 the Amazon, the Pantanal wetlands and Cerrado savanna \u2014 but is usually the second in the deforestation ranking and the first in the number of fire outbreaks.\n\n\u201cThe agribusiness and monoculture model has expanded from the Cerrado and advanced into the forest and the edges of the Pantanal, producing severe environmental damage,\u201d the state deputy Cabral told Mongabay.\n\nStill, Mato Grosso usually maintains a respectable environmental profile, partly due to a more progressivist wing of agribusiness represented by large corporations. Soy moratorium ratifiers, for example, are highly dependent on international financing and more susceptible to environmental scandals.\n\n\u201cThese companies have a more industrial model,\u201d political scientist Jo\u00e3o Edson said. \u201cAgribusiness is just one of their businesses, which also includes ports and other companies outside the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, however, this group has been facing sharp resistance from a more reactionary part of agribusiness. Strongly linked to former President Bolsonaro, it is composed of rural producers gathered in the state\u2019s soybean and corn producers association, Aprosoja, and Mato Grosso\u2019s agricultural and livestock federation, Famato. \u201cThe emergence of Bolsonaro ended up creating this rupture,\u201d Edson said.\n\nAmaral, from Observa-MT, said Mato Grosso has a well-structured environment secretary, especially compared with other Amazonian states. \u201cTransparency in the environmental area is also greater, and monitoring is carried out using advanced technologies.\u201d\n\nHowever, much of this reputation is supported by legislative changes designed to legalize illegal practices \u2014 like the one that magically \u201ctransformed\u201d Amazon areas into Cerrado ones.\n\nAmaral also points to the conciliation sessions promoted by Mato Grosso\u2019s administration, in which ranchers fined for illegal deforestation may be totally discharged or receive up to 90% discount on their environmental fines.\n\n\u201cThey are legalizing everything. First with the dismantling of legislation, bringing what is illegal into legality, and second with the conciliation task force,\u201d she said.\n\nBanner Image: Known as Brazil\u2019s granary, Mato Grosso is the country\u2019s top producer of soy, corn, cotton and beef.

            "content": "Analysts expect $187 billion in revenue, up from last quarter\u2019s $159 billion\n\nAmazon is set to report earnings Thursday, after the market close.\n\nEarnings are expected to increase from a year ago as the stock price trades near record highs.\n\nThe options market expects Amazon to move +/- 15 points, or 6% of Monday\u2019s stock price.\n\n\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal earnings on Thursday, after the market close. A conference call for investors will take place at 4:00 p.m. CST.\n\nThe earnings announcement, which represents one of the biggest releases for the U.S. market, comes amid a volatile market. S&P 500 futures sold off sharply in early morning trading on Monday as the market digested tariff headlines, which sent the S&P 500 VIX, otherwise known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, sharply higher.\n\nAmazon managed to weather the storm and turned positive through afternoon trading despite the broader market remaining in the red. The relative outperformance comes after Amazon posted new record highs over the past week, showing that investors remain bullish on the stock despite broader market headwinds.\n\nJanuary saw Amazon stock climb 8.3%, extending a healthy performance over the past year that sent its stock price up 44%, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 23% return. Investors have been bullish since Trump\u2019s election victory, seeing an easing of regulations and reduction in corporate income taxes as a tailwind for prices.\n\nAmazon even held up relatively well to last week\u2019s DeepSeek news that affected market sentiment in companies focused on artificial intelligence. Besides investing in its own proprietary AI, Amazon acts as an intermediary and has already employed DeepSeek in its customer base through Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do investors expect?\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.49 for the October to December period, according to TradingView. That would be up from an EPS of $1.00 a year ago. Last quarter, Amazon reported EPS of $1.43.\n\nRevenue is expected to cross the wires at $187.3 billion, which would compare to $170 billion a year ago. It would also be up from last quarter\u2019s $159 billion in revenue.\n\nAmazon has beaten EPS expectations every time over the last four quarters, although it\u2019s missed on revenue one time. Still, that is a solid track record compared to companies in the broader market.\n\nThe average one-year price target for the stock is 252.18, representing a 6% increase from Monday\u2019s 238.78 stock price. Analysts are mainly bullish on the stock, with 70 strong buy or buy ratings. Three issued hold ratings and only one gave it a sell rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Amazon earnings\n\nAmazon traded with an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 68.5, meaning that volatility is elevated compared to the past 12 months of trading. The options market is pricing in an expected move of +/- 14.98 points, or 6.3% of Monday\u2019s stock price.\n\nThe technical structure for Amazon is on the bullish side, with prices holding above a recent swing high at 233 from December. A break below that level would threaten the upward sloping 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which has supported prices since early October. Alternatively, Amazon is near all-time highs and a move higher could see additional strength come into the stock.\n\nGiven the heightened volatility, traders looking to get long could sell a put spread with the short at 232.5, which would work out if Amazon holds above the December swing high and has a positive to neutral reaction to earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "There are many high-flying stocks out there right now benefiting from enormous trends. But it can be difficult to gauge whether they're just flash-in-the-pan companies or great long-term investments.\n\nThankfully, plenty of established companies offer investors an opportunity to benefit from emerging trends, like artificial intelligence (AI), while still holding a leading position in other markets. Here are three reasons Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) is one such company, making it a great stock to buy right now.\n\n1. E-commerce continues growing\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business continues to be one of its core strengths, with the company holding about 40% of the e-commerce market in the U.S. last year. That's an impressive figure on its own, and even more impressive when you consider that Walmart took just 7% of U.S. e-commerce sales last year.\n\nI get that e-commerce doesn't seem as interesting as other tech-focused investments these days, but sometimes the boring -- but very large -- markets provide big opportunities. Statista estimates that the U.S. e-commerce market will be worth $1.9 trillion in 2029, a nearly 58% increase from 2024.\n\nAmazon's North American sales jumped 9% in the most recent quarter to $95.5 billion, proving this e-commerce juggernaut can continue expanding sales and benefit from this expanding market.\n\n2. Advertising is a huge opportunity\n\nAmazon isn't always thought of as an advertising company, but an increasing amount of its sales comes from ads on its e-commerce and video streaming services. Ad revenue spiked 19% in the third quarter, to $14.3 billion. That's notable because just six years ago, it made less than that in annual ad sales.\n\nThe company is also grabbing a larger share of the U.S. digital ad market. The latest estimates from eMarketer show that it will have nearly 14% of the market next year, and its ad sales will reach about $95 billion.\n\nAmazon's ad opportunity is even more impressive when you consider that by 2029, an estimated 83% of U.S. advertising spending will come from digital ads. With the company already seeing significant sales and market share gains in advertising, it's likely to continue benefiting from this space for years to come.\n\n3. AI cloud computing has enormous potential\n\nLast but certainly not least is its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's already ahead of the competition, with 31% of the cloud market, outpacing Microsoft with 20% and Alphabet's Google with 12%, and there could be more growth on the way.\n\nCompanies are rapidly expanding their AI cloud spending, and Goldman Sachs estimates that global cloud computing sales will reach $2 trillion by 2030, thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nAmazon has already seen the benefit from this, with chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky saying on the recent earnings call that customers are recognizing that to truly benefit from generative AI, \"they also need to move to the cloud.\"\n\nAWS' operating income rose by 48.5% in the third quarter to $10.4 billion, by far Amazon's most profitable business. Its established lead in cloud computing will help the company benefit even more as AI spending ramps up in the coming years.\n\nThe stock isn't cheap right now. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38 makes it pricier than the S&P 500's average of 24.3. But with Amazon's opportunities in advertising, e-commerce, and AI cloud computing, buying shares of an established leader in so many markets could end up being a great long-term decision.",

            "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Alexis Damancio Silva can't forget the hardship in his town of Puerto Narino in far southern Colombia last year when extreme drought nearly dried up the Amazon River. Pink dolphins and fish died. Crops dried up. The town lost its easy access to markets.\n\nSilva is hopeful the U.S. will help fund projects that would make Indigenous communities like his more resilient -- solar panels for energy to refrigerate fish, for example, or cisterns to catch precious rain water.\n\n\"We ask the government of President Trump ... to send us resources,\" to help the region's Indigenous people, he said in a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. Little comes from the state, he said.\n\nEnvironmental groups say that's unlikely to happen, and that was even before Trump froze new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nThey fear Donald Trump's second administration will bring nothing good for the Amazon rainforest. Besides Trump's Day 1 move to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, they fear he'll cut U.S. funding for policing that has targeted illegal logging, mining and other things that have damaged the rainforest. They also worry he will back right-wing politicians who favor aggressive development in the Amazon, which is critical for storing carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet.\n\n\"The implications of the Trump administration for the Amazon rainforest range from very concerning to horrifying,\" said Andrew Miller, advocacy director of nonprofit Amazon Watch.\n\nTrump's first week back in office was loaded with executive orders that prioritized fossil fuels, including declaring an energy emergency in the U.S. and his intent to sweep aside barriers to developing oil and gas. They've also been wrapped in an \"America First\" message that doesn't fit with expansive foreign aid.\n\nLast Sunday, he swiftly faced down Colombia President Gustavo Petro by threatening steep tariffs after Petro refused to allow military planes carrying deported migrants to land in Colombia. Trump's plans to play hardball in the region were evident weeks ago when he suggested he could use military force to take control of the Panama Canal.\n\nMiller said his organization had advised its partners \"to assume the Trump administration priorities will not include climate, environmental or Indigenous rights programs.\"\n\nIn Trump's first term, U.S. Agency for International Development's budget ranged from about $17 billion to $27 billion annually, with significant proposed cuts that were often moderated by Congress. Under President Joe Biden, USAID's budget rose to $30.5 billion in 2024, with a focus on global health, climate action, humanitarian aid and promoting democracy. The new administration said the aid freeze would be in place for 90 days as it considers which programs to keep.\n\nIn Brazil, home to around 60% of the Amazon, organized crime like logging and drug trafficking thrived under the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, with severe environmental consequences. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva made the protection of the Amazon a central priority when he took office in 2023.\n\nBrazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, told the AP that Trump's return poses a significant test for U.S. democracy and international institutions, and that as the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it is \"crucial\" the U.S. fulfills its responsibilities.\n\nShe sees some hope, saying the world has much stronger climate governance nowadays in the face of the climate crisis.\n\n\"This doesn't mean we'll have an easy time with Trump in office, quite the opposite,\" Marina Silva said. \"We just have to acknowledge that we're already seeing some companies and leaders ... abandoning or loosening commitments made previously.\"\n\nSince Trump's election, several major U.S. banks have withdrawn from a network aimed at lending practices that square with a global commitment to reduced emissions.\n\nSilva said it's important for countries to keep \"reaffirming the size of the climate challenges\" and showing how to overcome them. \"Reality needs to take precedence over President Trump's well-known denialist rhetoric,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nDevelopment in the Amazon is a polarizing issue in Brazil. Lawmakers who support it focus on economic growth, job creation and infrastructure. More liberal lawmakers, environmentalists and Indigenous rights groups oppose it over damage to the environment and effects on people who live in the forest.\n\nLula has had some success in clamping down on illegal logging, mining, drug trafficking and conversion of land for agriculture. That came with support from Biden, who in November became the first U.S. president to visit the Amazon and pledged $50 million to the Amazon Fund, which raises money to protect the Amazon rainforest. Much of that money went toward increased policing in the region.\n\nCarlos Nobre, a Brazilian climate scientist and leading researcher studying the Amazon rainforest, said he didn't see Trump continuing that commitment. He also said he is concerned about Trump's past support for Bolsonaro, and expected him to again boost right-wing politicians.\n\nThough Bolsonaro is prohibited from running for office until 2030, his son Eduardo is a potential presidential candidate next year and Brazil's National Congress has plenty of members who favor Amazonian development.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, who has supported Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, tried to attend his inauguration but wasn't allowed to leave Brazil to attend. Eduardo Bolsonaro did attend.\n\nMiller expected Trump to tilt toward \"extreme right-wing candidates\" who offer him praise, boosting them in elections.\n\n\"Their policies, should they be elected, will spell disaster for the Amazon rainforest in the foreseeable future,\" Miller said. \"Trump 2.0 will offer Amazonian governments a permission structure to ignore or walk back climate commitments, precisely at the moment when protection of the rainforest demands greater ambition and regional coordination.\"\n\nMiller is most concerned about U.S. support for multilateral human rights mechanisms like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\n\"Both are important for the protection of threatened Amazon community leaders and environmental defenders,\" he said.\n\nJohn Walsh, director for drug policy and the Andes at the Washington Office on Latin America, said funding cuts are his major concern after policy.\n\n\"We can expect steep cuts if not entire elimination of U.S. foreign aid that was directed towards climate mitigation and adaptation globally,\" Walsh said. \"That's matched by the incoming administration's focus on how to cut the federal budget in ways that will fall almost entirely on discretionary programs that don't have solid constituencies domestically.\"\n\nTrump was generally skeptical of multinational cooperation in his first term, preferring a more unilateral approach to foreign policy with his administration often prioritizing U.S. interests over international agreements or collaborations.\n\n\"For an issue like climate change, that is a collective action problem ... and for the world's largest economy and historically the largest emitter of carbon dioxide to absent itself from that ... is significant,\" Walsh said.",

            "content": "AMAZON RIVER BASIN, Northwest Brazil \u2013 A profound spiritual transformation is unfolding in the Amazon.\n\nFor centuries, the Catholic Church held a near-monopoly in the region. Today, evangelical Christianity is reshaping the region's spiritual fabric, leading to new converts and churches. CBN News traveled to Brazil's northwest Amazon region to witness it firsthand for this exclusive report.\n\nLinger on the banks of the Amazon River and you'll uncover more than the rich tapestry of life amid the natural splendor.\n\nFor many, such as Ramos, the river isn't just a backdrop; it's a sanctuary.\n\n\"My family and I all grew up here. My grandmother, grandfather and my parents lived and died in this house. I was born in this house and I'm also going to die here,\" Ramos told CBN News.\n\nAs an 83-year-old resident of the Amazon River, Ramos refuses to trade his floating bamboo house for life in any Brazilian city.\n\n\"It's so much cooler here than in the city. You cannot walk freely in the city. It's very dangerous, many cars, many people. I'm free here. I keep my windows open. The doors are always open. At my age, I've never faced danger,\" Ramos said.\n\nSpanning more than 6 million square miles of South America, 60% of the Amazon rain forest is in northwest Brazil. The approximately 30 million Amazonians currently living here are experiencing an unprecedented evangelical revival.\n\n\"God is everything for me. God is my father and without Jesus I'm nothing,\" Ramos told us.\n\nRamos epitomizes this spiritual shift.\n\nGrowing up Catholic, he remembers when the faith dominated his riverside community. Not anymore.\n\nThe Amazon River here in the northern part of Brazil is filled with hundreds of these small tributaries that in essence snake through the jungle, and over the many years evangelical Christians have been traversing these waters in an attempt to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to the Amazonian people.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n\"Those early days were definitely much, much more difficult than today,\" said Josu\u00e9 Bengtson, pastor of Belem Foursquare Church.\n\nBengtson has spent decades traversing the river's intricate network, first as a missionary then as a pastor spreading the evangelical message of salvation.\n\n\"Back when we started evangelizing in this region, we had just a few workers and, in some municipalities, pastors had to walk 10 to 15 km to open a congregation,\" Bengtson told CBN News. \"Today, almost all medium-sized churches in the Amazon have a small boat.\"\n\nBengtson helped establish one of the Amazon's first Foursquare churches.\n\nToday, he says the evangelical presence here is undeniable, with 3,200 Foursquare congregations alone flourishing across the region.\n\n\"In the first six months of this year we baptized 14,500 people. Our goal for this year is to baptize over 30,000 people,\" said Bengtson.\n\nWe obtained a video that captures a remarkable mass baptism in the Amazon River, where hundreds including, men, women, the elderly, young adults, and children \u2014 publicly profess their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd this growth goes beyond numbers, reaching the hearts of many like Esequiel Santo.\n\n\"I was 15 years old when God called me to reach the unreached peoples of the Amazon,\" Santo told CBN News.\n\nSanto spent 32 years as a missionary in the jungle's interior.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges was the isolation and getting used to living among the indigenous or riverside communities,\" Santo said. \"But God was with us in the work, we saw lives being transformed, so many people heard the gospel and now we are seeing the fruits.\"\n\nSanto says sharing the gospel here can be full of challenges.\n\n\"I'm from Rio de Janeiro, and back then since I couldn't afford a plane ticket, I had to take a 6-day bus journey to Belem. From there I went by boat for another six days to the outskirts of the Amazon basin,\" Santo said. \"Once I got there, it took at least 15 days by canoe, not a motorized boat, to paddle up the Solim\u00f5es River and the Purus River, until we reached the remote communities where we worked. Sometimes it would take 35 days just to get to these remote areas.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Eustaquio Alves, a leading Brazilian sociologist, says evangelical churches here benefit from long term pastors or missionaries like Santo who foster deep community ties and growth.\n\n\"The Catholic Church has a lot of difficulty in training new priests, so it is very common to see Catholic Churches in the Amazon but not enough priests to lead congregations,\" Dr. Alves said. \"A priest goes once a month or once every semester to the Amazon and is often far from the community. Evangelicals, on the other hand, quickly train pastors who integrate into the community and for a long time.\"\n\nToday, small evangelical churches like this one are springing up in remote riverside communities.\n\n\"I think that the revival that we have been waiting for here in Brazil is happening in the Amazon,\" said Alves.\n\nBrazilian senator and evangelical Pastor Damares Regina Alves sees this movement as a miracle that's not only reshaping spiritual practices but also fostering a sense of community and empowerment.\n\n\"For many years, people looked at the Amazon and only saw rivers and trees. Today, people are beginning to remember that there are people living there who need to be taken care of, need to hear the gospel and whose lives need a transformation. The church is making this revolution happen,\" said Alves.\n\nEvangelical Christians often must rely on small canoes or medium-sized boats to hold church services and other ministry activities as they reach remote regions.\n\nMeanwhile, church teams from Brazil's major cities send volunteers here to conduct educational, humanitarian, and medical missions.\n\nThis outreach often helps introduce people to the gospel message.\n\nThese pastors, missionaries and many others laboring in this vast expanse believe the shift is more than just a change in religious practice \u2013 it's a movement that promises to redefine the region's spiritual and social landscape for generations to come.\n\nMUST SEE REPORT: Thousands of Mosques Close as 1 Million Muslims Choose Christ Instead",

King Charles III is set to join the entrepreneurial couple in the nonfiction film space, with production already underway for an Amazon Prime feature about his urgent concerns about the future of the planet.\n\nThe film has yet to be publicly named, but according to the UK Times, it will center on the ideals presented by King Charles in his 2010 book, Harmony: A New Way of Looking At Our World.\n\nSpeaking with Vanity Fair at the time of the book\u2019s release, the then-prince of Wales said that he wrote the philosophical treatise because \u201cI am absolutely determined to be the defender of nature. Full stop. That\u2019s what the rest of my life is going to be concerned with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a call to revolution,\u201d the longtime environmentalist wrote in the opening of the now-15-year-old book. \u201cThe Earth is under threat. It cannot cope with all that we demand of it.

            "content": "Billionaires haven't missed out on the artificial intelligence (AI) story. Managers of some of the world's biggest funds have piled into this popular growth area, investing in stocks that have fueled gains in all three major indexes.\n\nLast year, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 23% and 28%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 12% thanks to excitement about this technology.\n\nAnd one of the most sought-after stocks has been Nvidia (NVDA -4.05%), a player that's been roaring higher since the early days of the AI boom. The stock climbed 171% last year alone.\n\nIt's the leading designer of AI chips, and this has helped the company's revenue soar to records quarter after quarter. This AI star was one of the four most popular tech stocks in a Motley Fool analysis last year of 16 hedge funds run by billionaires.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only company benefiting right now from the AI boom. Amazon (AMZN -2.83%), through its cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells a wide variety of AI products and services to customers, and this helped AWS report an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. Shares rose 44% last year.\n\nThough both of these stocks are important fixtures in many successful investors' portfolios, in recent times, billionaires have been buying one and selling the other.\n\nA glimpse into the minds of billionaires\n\nManagers overseeing $100 million or more must file a report each quarter detailing their investment moves, and these 13F forms offer us a glimpse into the minds of some of the world's best investors. Copying every one of their moves isn't realistic, and certain buys or sells may not even align with your strategy or investment style.\n\nBut a look through the 13F window into what billionaires are doing could offer us valuable insights -- and some investing ideas -- since they have proved their knowledge of the market over time. And in recent times, billionaires have been buying Amazon and selling Nvidia.\n\nIn the third quarter, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Associates, Stephen Mandel Jr.'s Lone Pine Capital, and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management each added to their shares of Amazon. Caxton made a particularly big move, increasing its Amazon holding by more than 400%, and it now represents 10% of the portfolio, up from just under 2%.\n\nAt the same time, Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office sold all of his Nvidia shares, and Appaloosa Management's David Tepper and Coatue's Laffont reduced their positions in the top chip designer.\n\nOf course, these moves don't necessarily mean Nvidia's growth is over. Druckenmiller even said in an interview with Bloomberg that he regretted his sale of the stock and would consider buying it again if the price were right.\n\nIn many cases, investors are locking in profits on Nvidia and looking for other players that may have a lot to gain in the next wave of AI growth. And that company may be Amazon.\n\nAI scores wins in e-commerce and cloud computing\n\nAmazon is winning in AI in two ways. The company's e-commerce operation has become more efficient thanks to its investment in the technology.\n\nFor example, AI-powered robotics have streamlined operations in fulfillment centers. And this helps lower costs, allowing it to keep offering low prices to customers and still generate a solid profit. This is immediately positive for earnings and should boost profits down the road as customers, liking those low prices, keep coming back.\n\nBut where Amazon may score the biggest win is in cloud computing. As mentioned, AWS sells a massive portfolio of AI products and services, and this already has supercharged revenue growth.\n\nNow, as we enter the agentic AI era, Amazon could play a major role. Agentic AI is software that can reason and apply a solution to a problem, allowing the progress we've seen so far in the technology to be applied to the real world.\n\nIt's seen as driving a whole new wave of AI growth. And AWS, with its platform for building agentic AI, could become one of the big winners.\n\nSo billionaires who have been buying shares of Amazon may be setting themselves up for additional AI gains this year and in the years to come. And the good news is that you don't have to be a billionaire, drop Nvidia, or overhaul your strategy to potentially score a win, too. Instead, just add a few shares of Amazon to your portfolio and hold on as this AI growth story moves into the next exciting stages.",

            "content": "This is a guest blog post co-written with Jordan Knight, Sara Reynolds, George Lee from Travelers.\n\nFoundation models (FMs) are used in many ways and perform well on tasks including text generation, text summarization, and question answering. Increasingly, FMs are completing tasks that were previously solved by supervised learning, which is a subset of machine learning (ML) that involves training algorithms using a labeled dataset. In some cases, smaller supervised models have shown the ability to perform in production environments while meeting latency requirements. However, there are benefits to building an FM-based classifier using an API service such as Amazon Bedrock, such as the speed to develop the system, the ability to switch between models, rapid experimentation for prompt engineering iterations, and the extensibility into other related classification tasks. An FM-driven solution can also provide rationale for outputs, whereas a traditional classifier lacks this capability. In addition to these features, modern FMs are powerful enough to meet accuracy and latency requirements to replace supervised learning models.\n\nIn this post, we walk through how the Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) collaborated with leading property and casualty insurance carrier Travelers to develop an FM-based classifier through prompt engineering. Travelers receives millions of emails a year with agent or customer requests to service policies. The system GenAIIC and Travelers built uses the predictive capabilities of FMs to classify complex, and sometimes ambiguous, service request emails into several categories. This FM classifier powers the automation system that can save tens of thousands of hours of manual processing and redirect that time toward more complex tasks. With Anthropic\u2019s Claude models on Amazon Bedrock, we formulated the problem as a classification task, and through prompt engineering and partnership with the business subject matter experts, we achieved 91% classification accuracy.\n\nProblem Formulation\n\nThe main task was classifying emails received by Travelers into a service request category. Requests involved areas like address changes, coverage adjustments, payroll updates, or exposure changes. Although we used a pre-trained FM, the problem was formulated as a text classification task. However, instead of using supervised learning, which normally involves training resources, we used prompt engineering with few-shot prompting to predict the class of an email. This allowed us to use a pre-trained FM without having to incur the costs of training. The workflow started with an email, then, given the email\u2019s text and any PDF attachments, the email was given a classification by the model.\n\nIt should be noted that fine-tuning an FM is another approach that could have improved the performance of the classifier with an additional cost. By curating a longer list of examples and expected outputs, an FM can be trained to perform better on a specific task. In this case, given the accuracy was already high by just using prompt engineering, the accuracy after fine-tuning would have to justify the cost. Although at the time of the engagement, Anthropic\u2019s Claude models weren\u2019t available for fine-tuning on Amazon Bedrock, now Anthropic\u2019s Claude Haiku fine-tuning is in beta testing through Amazon Bedrock.\n\nOverview of solution\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution pipeline to classify an email.\n\nThe workflow consists of the following steps:\n\nThe raw email is ingested into the pipeline. The body text is extracted from the email text files. If the email has a PDF attachment, the PDF is parsed. The PDF is split into individual pages. Each page is saved as an image. The PDF page images are processed by Amazon Textract to extract text, specific entities, and table data using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Text from the email is parsed. The text is then cleaned of HTML tags, if necessary. The text from the email body and PDF attachment are combined into a single prompt for the large language model (LLM). Anthropic\u2019s Claude classifies this content into one of 13 defined categories and then returns that class. The predictions for each email are further used for analysis of performance.\n\nAmazon Textract served multiple purposes, such as extracting the raw text of the forms included in as attachments in emails. Additional entity extraction and table data detection was included to identify names, policy numbers, dates, and more. The Amazon Textract output was then combined with the email text and given to the model to decide the appropriate class.\n\nThis solution is serverless, which has many benefits for the organization. With a serverless solution, AWS provides a managed solution, facilitating lower cost of ownership and reduced complexity of maintenance.\n\nData\n\nThe ground truth dataset contained over 4,000 labeled email examples. The raw emails were in Outlook .msg format and raw .eml format. Approximately 25% of the emails had PDF attachments, of which most were ACORD insurance forms. The PDF forms included additional details that provided a signal for the classifier. Only PDF attachments were processed to limit the scope; other attachments were ignored. For most examples, the body text contained the majority of the predictive signal that aligned with one of the 13 classes.\n\nPrompt engineering\n\nTo build a strong prompt, we needed to fully understand the differences between categories to provide sufficient explanations for the FM. Through manually analyzing email texts and consulting with business experts, the prompt included a list of explicit instructions on how to classify an email. Additional instructions showed Anthropic\u2019s Claude how to identify key phrases that help distinguish an email\u2019s class from the others. The prompt also included few-shot examples that demonstrated how to perform the classification, and output examples that showed how the FM is to format its response. By providing the FM with examples and other prompting techniques, we were able to significantly reduce the variance in the structure and content of the FM output, leading to explainable, predictable, and repeatable results.\n\nThe structure of the prompt was as follows:\n\nPersona definition\n\nOverall instruction\n\nFew-shot examples\n\nDetailed definitions for each class\n\nEmail data input\n\nFinal output instruction\n\nTo learn more about prompt engineering for Anthropic\u2019s Claude, refer to Prompt engineering in the Anthropic documentation.\n\n\u201cClaude\u2019s ability to understand complex insurance terminology and nuanced policy language makes it particularly adept at tasks like email classification. Its capacity to interpret context and intent, even in ambiguous communications, aligns perfectly with the challenges faced in insurance operations. We\u2019re excited to see how Travelers and AWS have harnessed these capabilities to create such an efficient solution, demonstrating the potential for AI to transform insurance processes.\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Pelosi, Anthropic\n\nResults\n\nFor an FM-based classifier to be used in production, it must show a high level of accuracy. Initial testing without prompt engineering yielded 68% accuracy. After using a variety of techniques with Anthropic\u2019s Claude v2, such as prompt engineering, condensing categories, adjusting document processing process, and improving instructions, accuracy increased to 91%. Anthropic\u2019s Claude Instant on Amazon Bedrock also performed well, with 90% accuracy, with additional areas of improvement identified.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we discussed how FMs can reliably automate the classification of insurance service emails through prompt engineering. When formulating the problem as a classification task, an FM can perform well enough for production environments, while maintaining extensibility into other tasks and getting up and running quickly. All experiments were conducted using Anthropic\u2019s Claude models on Amazon Bedrock.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nJordan Knight is a Senior Data Scientist working for Travelers in the Business Insurance Analytics & Research Department.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUPS will reduce the amount of Amazon volume it delivers by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 under an agreement in principle reached by the two companies, UPS announced Thursday.\n\nThe carrier determined if it took no action on its relationship with Amazon, it would likely result in diminishing returns, CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said on a Q4 earnings call.\n\n\"Amazon is our largest customer, but it's not our most profitable customer,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe agreement marks an acceleration of UPS' yearslong push to reduce its reliance on Amazon for volume and revenue. The carrier is striving to capture volume from more profitable segments like healthcare product shippers and small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAmazon has built out its own logistics network to deliver more customer orders itself but still uses a mix of carriers to cover the remainder of its orders. According to Amazon, it offered to increase UPS' volumes as the e-commerce giant\u2019s delivery needs continued to grow.\n\n\u201cDue to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement emailed to sister publication Supply Chain Dive. \"We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nEven with previous volume reduction efforts, Amazon still makes up a large portion of UPS' business. Executives said about 20% to 25% of volume in UPS' U.S. network is tied to Amazon, and the percentage of revenue derived from the company last year was 11.8%.\n\nThe decline in Amazon volume will lead to fewer packages being delivered by UPS, but at more profitable rates. In 2025, UPS expects average daily U.S. volume to drop about 8.5% year over year while revenue per package is projected to increase by 6%, per an earnings presentation.\n\n\"The results of this change will be lower overall volume levels, but an improved customer base at a significantly higher revenue per piece,\" EVP and CFO Brian Dykes said, adding that UPS will adjust its network as necessary to match capacity with demand.\n\nTom\u00e9 said she doesn't believe the remainder of Amazon's volume is on the chopping block, noting Amazon's reliance on The UPS Store locations for customer returns.\n\n\"I don't think it will go all away,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"I think we're landing at the right spot with this accelerated glide down.\"",

What will this mean for UPS Teamsters and how can we protect our jobs?\n\n\n\nWhy They\u2019re Doing It\n\nFirst, this isn\u2019t happening because UPS is in financial trouble.\n\nUPS is highly profitable. The company made $8.9 billion in profits last year. Now, UPS is reducing Amazon deliveries to make even more.\n\nAmazon accounts for 20% to 25% of UPS\u2019s packages in the U.S. But UPS makes less profit per Amazon package. That\u2019s one reason UPS has already been cutting the number of Amazon packages it delivers every year.\n\n\u201cAmazon is our largest customer, but it\u2019s not our most profitable customer,\u201d CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 told investor analysts.\n\nUPS is reducing the amount of Amazon volume to increase the company\u2019s profits per package and overall operating margins.\n\n\u201cBetter Not Bigger\u201d\n\nThis is all part of the company\u2019s \u201cbetter not bigger\u201d strategy which puts more emphasis on profit margins than on volume and job creation.\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason that UPS is closing rural buildings and older facilities and building modern, automated hubs. UPS told investors it wants to close 10% of its facilities.\n\nUPS Teamsters want the company to be successful to protect and create good union jobs.\n\nCEO Carol Tome wants higher profit margins. She\u2019s catering to Wall Street. Their idea of \u201cbetter\u201d is very different from ours. So what do we do?\n\nFocus on Contract Enforcement and Union Action\n\nIt\u2019s been a month of whiplash for UPS Teamsters. Earlier this month, Surepost ended and volume surged. Now UPS is announcing Amazon volume will drop over the next 18 months.\n\nAs union members, we need to focus on what we can control. That\u2019s not volume. It\u2019s contract enforcement.\n\nWhen volume and excessive overtime surges, 9.5 rights and 8-hour requests are tools we have to fight excessive overtime. When volume drops, they become tools to protect jobs by distributing the work.\n\nInside workers have other tools, including supervisors working grievances and protecting our daily guarantee.\n\nThe company has their agenda which is higher profit margins. Our agenda is enforcing our contract and protecting good union jobs.\n\nUPS Teamsters need to get behind our union\u2019s efforts to organize Amazon and stop the race to the bottom in our industry.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to be protecting ourselves by enforcing the contract and uniting as Teamsters to protect good union jobs.\n\nCheck out our most recent webinar for tips on contract enforcement and protecting ourselves from discipline:",

            "content": "The stunning revelation of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) decision to seek information from a Chinese e-commerce platform, Temu, to build an antitrust case against Amazon reflects an outrageous disregard of the agency\u2019s prosecutorial discretion. However, this collaboration between a U.S. regulatory body and a Chinese Communist Party-linked competitor represents more than just questionable regulatory practice\u2014it reveals a fundamental misalignment between America\u2019s strategic interests and its antitrust policy. The FTC\u2019s decision to work with a geopolitical rival to attack a leading American technology company demands immediate scrutiny and reconsideration by the new Trump administration.\n\nTo be sure, the FTC\u2019s case against Amazon was marketed to the public as anything but an opportunity to collaborate with the Chinese firm that constitutes Amazon\u2019s largest global competitor and has now surpassed it in monthly active users. Specifically, the FTC has long proclaimed that its antitrust attack against Amazon was part of an effort to fight for and work with small businesses and ordinary Americans against an alleged monopolist engaged in conduct that, in Khan\u2019s own words, was \u201churting consumers and sellers\u201d and that it was \u201csmall businesses survival that\u2019s on the line.\u201d The reality of the FTC working with large rival platforms like Temu paints an entirely different picture of what may have been really going on.\n\nMoreover, Temu is not merely a big digital platform. It maintains documented connections to the Chinese Communist Party and faces significant ethical concerns regarding labor practices, intellectual property violations, and data privacy. In fact, Temu was created in 2022 to compete with Amazon. This meteoric rise mirrors China\u2019s broader pattern of using its vast domestic market and state resources to build \u201cnational champions\u201d that can then outcompete U.S. firms globally. The idea that the FTC would seek collaboration with such an entity\u2014one that embodies the very market distortions and strategic challenges that American policymakers have long warned about\u2014represents a profound and unacceptable lapse of judgment by an agency that has historically known far better.\n\nUnfortunately, engaging in problematic foreign collaborations to undermine Amazon is nothing new for Khan\u2019s FTC. Early last year, the FTC coordinated with European regulators to block Amazon\u2019s acquisition of iRobot (Roomba\u2019s maker), leading to EU objections that forced the deal\u2019s collapse and required iRobot to lay off a third of its workforce while Chinese state-subsidized competitors gained advantage. This opened the door to Chinese domination in the home robot sector. And, while even coordination with allied nations can raise strategic concerns when targeting companies vital to American technological leadership, working with CCP-adjacent Chinese companies to this end reaches a whole other level of regulatory insanity.\n\nWithout question, the FTC\u2019s course of conduct against Amazon, also taken in conjunction with the highly problematic antitrust claims it alleges, can only be explained by a deeply rooted hostility against the company. To be sure, beginning with her flawed law review article, breaking up Amazon has long been former Chair Khan\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, pivoting her in just a few short years from law student to legal stardom. Of course, despite Amazon\u2019s formal recusal requests citing federal ethics rules and due process concerns, Khan declined to recuse herself from the case. In fact, Khan\u2019s disregard for ethical standards in her crusade against Big Tech contributed to the resignation of one of the FTC commissioners, whose ethics objections were smothered by the FTC.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the FTC\u2019s collaboration with Temu to acquire ammunition in its antitrust lawsuit against Amazon was clearly at odds with even the broader intergovernmental and bipartisan recognition of the China threat. Specifically, even the Biden administration identified China as America\u2019s primary strategic competitor, with Congress actively working to pass legislation enhancing American competitiveness. All the while, the FTC was working with a Chinese competitor against an American technology leader. Indeed, the fact that the U.S. government banned TikTok over national security concerns while its FTC collaborates with another Chinese platform underscores the disconnect between strategic goals and regulatory enforcement.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s decision to collaborate with Chinese Big Tech firms against leading American innovators is particularly troubling given the pivotal U.S.-China rivalry in areas like artificial intelligence. Indeed, leadership in artificial intelligence will shape not only technological dominance but also national economic power, industrial strength, and military advantage. As demonstrated by DeepSeek\u2019s recent development of an artificial intelligence model matching GPT-4 performance levels at substantially lower costs, it is clear that China can innovate at or beyond the capabilities of America\u2019s top tech firms. At bottom, working with Temu to attack Amazon, which has committed billions to drive U.S. AI development, adds the worst kind of insult to an already injurious antitrust policy.\n\nThe new Trump administration should realign antitrust policy with strategic objectives. While legitimate antitrust concerns deserve attention, enforcement actions must be calibrated to protect rather than undermine America\u2019s strategic interests. This means fostering constructive collaboration with American companies while preventing antitrust policy from becoming an ideological weapon that advantages foreign competitors. Without such a realignment, continued aggressive regulatory action against leading U.S. technology companies will seriously impair America\u2019s capacity to innovate and maintain its technological edge\u2014particularly in critical areas like AI\u2014precisely when maintaining such leadership is most crucial.",

Earnings for Amazon stock are due Feb. 6 and management will likely comment on the sudden emergence of DeepSeek.\n\nControlled by Chinese hedge fund High Flyer, DeepSeek competes with U.S. companies like startups OpenAI and Anthropic as well as tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). Meta has been the leader in open-source AI models but DeepSeek poses a challenge.\n\nAmazon Web Services has offered AI app developers access to models from Anthropic, Meta and many other providers. Amazon has invested $8 billion in Anthropic.\n\nPrices have been falling rapidly for software developers renting AI models via cloud computing services. AI model makers typically split revenue with cloud companies.\n\nDeepSeek's prices are reportedly much lower than OpenAI or Anthropics.\n\nAmazon Stock: DeepSeek AI Model\n\n\"With AWS, you can use DeepSeek-R1 models to build, experiment, and responsibly scale your generative AI ideas by using this powerful, cost-efficient model with minimal infrastructure investment,\" AWS said on its cloud computing website on Thursday.\n\nOn the stock market today, AMZN stock rose 2% to 239.42 in midday trading.\n\nMeanwhile, a rivalry is brewing between DeepSeek and open source leader Meta, which offers its Llama family of models.\n\nOn Meta's fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts on Jan. 29, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"I also just think in light of some of the recent news, the new competitor, DeepSeek from China, I think it also just puts \u2014 it's one of the things that we're talking about is there's going to be an open source standard globally. And I think for our kind of own national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard.\"\n\nAmazon Stock: U.S., China Competition\n\nThe U.S. aims to stay ahead of China in the race to develop AGI, or artificial general intelligence. AGI capability is considered the highest form of AI, featuring humanlike or better cognitive capabilities.\n\nThe AI trend has relied mainly on large language models, or LLMs, which require massive amounts of data to be trained. Large language models allow users to interact with AI systems without the need to write algorithms.\n\nThe capabilities of open-source models, which are free to developers, have advanced rapidly.\n\nAnyone can reuse open-source LLMs and build on top of them. As a result, more efficient open-source models are emerging that reduce the computing power needed to \"train\" LLMs, or essentially feed them data.\n\nFalling Prices Commoditize AI Models\n\nJPMorgan analyst Gokul Hariharan, in a report published Friday, said: \"Significant cost differences in training of AI models with comparable reasoning performance brings into question the necessity of large-scale GPU investment, higher training costs and large cluster sizes, and whether better model performance in a cost-efficient manner can instead be achieved.\"\n\n\"The inference prices for users with DeepSeek R1 are only 3% to 4% vs. those of OpenAI-o1. Even before DeepSeek R1's introduction, AI inference costs have been dropping at around 85% to 90% per year, which has been a driving force in triggering new AI applications that were not previously possible or cost-effective,\" he added.\n\nAmazon Stock: Cloud Vendors Divvy Up Business\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI, having provided over $13 billion in funding to the generative AI leader. However, Microsoft has moved away from being the exclusive provider of cloud computing infrastructure to OpenAI, which has turned to Oracle (ORCL), Coreweave and others.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently announced the $100 billion Stargate AI project.\n\nDespite close ties to OpenAI, revenue growth of Microsoft's Azure cloud business has disappointed amid capacity issues.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure business grew 31% year over year in fiscal Q2, at the low end of its guidance range and a deceleration from prior quarters. The company predicted Azure growth in the current quarter of 31% to 32% in constant currency, dashing hopes for a re-acceleration of growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nOn its earnings call with analysts, management noted that Azure was offering access to DeepSeek training models.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon stock has gained 7% in 2025.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nLearn The Best Stock Trading Rules From IBD's Investor's Corner\n\nWant To Trade Options?

            "content": "Having tested both and the rest of the Kindle lineup , I can safely say that each has its perks, but what's my winner? Read on to find out.\n\nYou know the bit from The Office where Pam asks Creed to find the differences between the two photos? And the kicker is that they're the same photo. That's how I feel comparing Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition . These devices have more in common than not, which is exactly why I think people so commonly ask what the differences between the two are.\n\nWhat the Paperwhite and Signature Edition have in common: Specs and performance\n\nBoth the Kindle Paperwhite (L) and the Paperwhite Signature Edition (R) have adjustable brightness and warmth. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nYou won't spot any differences between the two devices just by looking at them. They're the same size, with the same resolution screen. The power button, charging port, and audio jack are in the same spot on both devices. And they both have the following specs:\n\n7-inch display, up to 94 nits brightness, and 300 ppi resolution\n\nUSB-C charging port with up to 12 weeks of battery life\n\nIPX8 waterproof rating \u2014 can be fully submerged in water for up to one hour\n\nThroughout my weeks of testing, I found no difference between the devices' speed and usability. Both e-readers provide exceptional performance. The 2024 models are the fastest e-readers I've tested, quickly downloading books and flipping between pages.\n\nWhile other e-readers lag when swiping between pages, the Paperwhite and Signature Edition move quickly between pages, never needing time to load. If you need to flip a few pages ahead, just a few taps get you there without delay. Not to mention, both Kindles have a 12-week battery life, so you rarely have to charge them.\n\nEach device has adjustable brightness and warmth for reading in any environment. Turning up the warmth is one of the best features of the Paperwhite and Signature Edition, making it easier to read at night without eye strain.\n\nPlus, Kindle has mastered Libby integration. To get library books on your Kindle, you just need to push a button in the Libby app.\n\nKindle Paperwhite vs. Signature Edition: Color\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is just a slightly duller version of the Signature Edition's metallic jade. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nAs mentioned, the build and design of the Paperwhite and Signature Edition are nearly identical, except for color \u2014 and only kind of. The Paperwhite and Signature Edition come in three shades: black, jade, and raspberry. The slight difference between the two is that the shades on the Signature Edition are metallic, while the Paperwhite is matte.\n\nWhile the Signature Edition shades are nicer, the difference is so miniscule that it's not worth it to pick a model based on the colors, especially when there is a $40 price difference.\n\nKindle Paperwhite vs. Signature Edition: Storage\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the Paperwhite and Paperwhite Signature Edition isn't seen. The Paperwhite has 16GB of storage, while the Paperwhite Signature Edition has twice that at 32GB.\n\nWhen it comes to phones and laptops, 16 or 32GB of storage is nothing these days. But for e-readers, 16GB is plenty of storage. The average e-book takes up to 2MB of storage, meaning you can hold thousands of e-books with 16GB. That's plenty of storage for me, and 32GB is overkill. However, if you've used an e-reader with 16GB and have run out of storage, then 32GB might be totally necessary.\n\nKindle Paperwhite vs. Signature Edition: Price\n\nWhen considering price, the Paperwhite is the more affordable option. The Kindle Paperwhite starts at $159.99, while the Paperwhite Signature Edition costs $199.99. The Signature Edition's price isn't just because of its shiny metallic shade. For $40 more, you get added features like auto-adjusting brightness, 32GB of storage, and an ad-free lock screen.\n\nKindle Paperwhite vs. Signature Edition: All the extras\n\nThe Paperwhite Signature Edition even works with the Apple MagSafe charger. Credit: Samantha Mangino / Mashable\n\nSpeaking of features, the Signature Edition shines. For $40 more, you'll get more storage, wireless charging, auto-adjusting brightness, and an ad-free lock screen.\n\nThe best feature of the bunch is the ad-free lock screen. On the Kindle Paperwhite, when not in use, your Kindle will push through various ads from the Kindle shop. It's not the worst, but if you're getting a Kindle for digital reading without distraction, not having ads is a massive perk. (Plus, some of the suggestions can be pretty out there.) The downside is that with no ads, the Signature Edition's lock screen has no \"swipe to unlock\" feature, so it tends to unlock on its own when you leave it in your bag. However, if you grab a case with a cover, it's an easy workaround.\n\nI'm far less impressed when it comes to the auto-adjusting brightness and wireless charging. I've used the Signature Edition for months, and the auto-adjusting brightness works about 20 percent of the time, and even when it does, I still need to go in and manually adjust it. The wireless charging is also fine. Amazon makes a wireless charging pad you can purchase; however, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is also compatible with other chargers like the Apple MagSafe charger. That said, I never found this feature necessary since USB-C chargers are plentiful these days, and the Kindle only needs to be charged every two to three months.",

            "content": "Updated on February 5, 2025 \u2014 DeepSeek-R1 Distill Llama and Qwen models are now available in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.\n\nDuring this past AWS re:Invent, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared valuable lessons learned from Amazon\u2019s own experience developing nearly 1,000 generative AI applications across the company. Drawing from this extensive scale of AI deployment, Jassy offered three key observations that have shaped Amazon\u2019s approach to enterprise AI implementation.\n\nFirst is that as you get to scale in generative AI applications, the cost of compute really matters. People are very hungry for better price performance. The second is actually quite difficult to build a really good generative AI application. The third is the diversity of the models being used when we gave our builders freedom to pick what they want to do. It doesn\u2019t surprise us, because we keep learning the same lesson over and over and over again, which is that there is never going to be one tool to rule the world.\n\nAs Andy emphasized, a broad and deep range of models provided by Amazon empowers customers to choose the precise capabilities that best serve their unique needs. By closely monitoring both customer needs and technological advancements, AWS regularly expands our curated selection of models to include promising new models alongside established industry favorites. This ongoing expansion of high-performing and differentiated model offerings helps customers stay at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\nThis leads us to Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. DeepSeek launched DeepSeek-V3 on December 2024 and subsequently released DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Zero with 671 billion parameters, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill models ranging from 1.5\u201370 billion parameters on January 20, 2025. They added their vision-based Janus-Pro-7B model on January 27, 2025. The models are publicly available and are reportedly 90-95% more affordable and cost-effective than comparable models. Per Deepseek, their model stands out for its reasoning capabilities, achieved through innovative training techniques such as reinforcement learning.\n\nToday, you can now deploy DeepSeek-R1 models in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI. Amazon Bedrock is best for teams seeking to quickly integrate pre-trained foundation models through APIs. Amazon SageMaker AI is ideal for organizations that want advanced customization, training, and deployment, with access to the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, you can also use AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia to deploy DeepSeek-R1-Distill models cost-effectively via Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\nWith AWS, you can use DeepSeek-R1 models to build, experiment, and responsibly scale your generative AI ideas by using this powerful, cost-efficient model with minimal infrastructure investment. You can also confidently drive generative AI innovation by building on AWS services that are uniquely designed for security. We highly recommend integrating your deployments of the DeepSeek-R1 models with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to add a layer of protection for your generative AI applications, which can be used by both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI customers.\n\nYou can choose how to deploy DeepSeek-R1 models on AWS today in a few ways: 1/ Amazon Bedrock Marketplace for the DeepSeek-R1 model, 2/ Amazon SageMaker JumpStart for the DeepSeek-R1 model, 3/ Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import for the DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, and 4/ Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances for the DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.\n\nLet me walk you through the various paths for getting started with DeepSeek-R1 models on AWS. Whether you\u2019re building your first AI application or scaling existing solutions, these methods provide flexible starting points based on your team\u2019s expertise and requirements.\n\n1. The DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace\n\nAmazon Bedrock Marketplace offers over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized FMs alongside the current selection of industry-leading models in Amazon Bedrock. You can easily discover models in a single catalog, subscribe to the model, and then deploy the model on managed endpoints.\n\nTo access the DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, go to the Amazon Bedrock console and select Model catalog under the Foundation models section. You can quickly find DeepSeek by searching or filtering by model providers.\n\nAfter checking out the model detail page including the model\u2019s capabilities, and implementation guidelines, you can directly deploy the model by providing an endpoint name, choosing the number of instances, and selecting an instance type.\n\nYou can also configure advanced options that let you customize the security and infrastructure settings for the DeepSeek-R1 model including VPC networking, service role permissions, and encryption settings. For production deployments, you should review these settings to align with your organization\u2019s security and compliance requirements.\n\nWith Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, you can independently evaluate user inputs and model outputs. You can control the interaction between users and DeepSeek-R1 with your defined set of policies by filtering undesirable and harmful content in generative AI applications. The DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace can only be used with Bedrock\u2019s ApplyGuardrail API to evaluate user inputs and model responses for custom and third-party FMs available outside of Amazon Bedrock. To learn more, read Implement model-independent safety measures with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails can also be integrated with other Bedrock tools including Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build safer and more secure generative AI applications aligned with responsible AI policies. To learn more, visit the AWS Responsible AI page.\n\nUpdated on 1st February \u2013 You can use the Bedrock playground for understanding how the model responds to various inputs and letting you fine-tune your prompts for optimal results.\n\nWhen using DeepSeek-R1 model with the Bedrock\u2019s playground or InvokeModel API, please use DeepSeek\u2019s chat template for optimal results. For example, <\uff5cbegin_of_sentence\uff5c><\uff5cUser\uff5c>content for inference<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c> .\n\nRefer to this step-by-step guide on how to deploy the DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace. To learn more, visit Deploy models in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace.\n\n2. The DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart\n\nAmazon SageMaker JumpStart is a machine learning (ML) hub with FMs, built-in algorithms, and prebuilt ML solutions that you can deploy with just a few clicks. To deploy DeepSeek-R1 in SageMaker JumpStart, you can discover the DeepSeek-R1 model in SageMaker Unified Studio, SageMaker Studio, SageMaker AI console, or programmatically through the SageMaker Python SDK.\n\nIn the Amazon SageMaker AI console, open SageMaker Studio and choose JumpStart and search for \u201c DeepSeek-R1 \u201d in the All public models page.\n\nYou can select the model and choose deploy to create an endpoint with default settings. When the endpoint comes InService, you can make inferences by sending requests to its endpoint.\n\nYou can derive model performance and ML operations controls with Amazon SageMaker AI features such as Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, Amazon SageMaker Debugger, or container logs. The model is deployed in an AWS secure environment and under your virtual private cloud (VPC) controls, helping to support data security.\n\nAs like Bedrock Marketpalce, you can use the ApplyGuardrail API in the SageMaker JumpStart to decouple safeguards for your generative AI applications from the DeepSeek-R1 model. You can now use guardrails without invoking FMs, which opens the door to more integration of standardized and thoroughly tested enterprise safeguards to your application flow regardless of the models used.\n\nRefer to this step-by-step guide on how to deploy the DeepSeek-R1 model in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. To learn more, visit Discover SageMaker JumpStart models in SageMaker Unified Studio or Deploy SageMaker JumpStart models in SageMaker Studio.\n\n3. DeepSeek-R1-Distill models using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import\n\nAmazon Bedrock Custom Model Import provides the ability to import and use your customized models alongside existing FMs through a single serverless, unified API without the need to manage underlying infrastructure. With Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, you can import DeepSeek-R1-Distill models ranging from 1.5\u201370 billion parameters. As I highlighted in my blog post about Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation, the distillation process involves training smaller, more efficient models to mimic the behavior and reasoning patterns of the larger DeepSeek-R1 model with 671 billion parameters by using it as a teacher model.\n\nAfter storing these publicly available models in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon SageMaker Model Registry, go to Imported models under Foundation models in the Amazon Bedrock console and import and deploy them in a fully managed and serverless environment through Amazon Bedrock. This serverless approach eliminates the need for infrastructure management while providing enterprise-grade security and scalability.\n\nUpdated on 1st February \u2013 After importing the distilled model, you can use the Bedrock playground for understanding distilled model responses for your inputs.\n\nWatch a demo video made by my colleague Du\u2019An Lightfoot for importing the model and inference in the Bedrock playground.\n\nRefer to this step-by-step guide on how to deploy DeepSeek-R1-Distill models using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. To learn more, visit Import a customized model into Amazon Bedrock.\n\n4.

            "content": "OAKLAND \u2013 California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced a settlement with Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon) resolving allegations under Proposition 65 and the Unfair Competition Law arising from Amazon\u2019s facilitation of sales into California of skin-lightening creams with high mercury levels. As part of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, Amazon will pay nearly $600,000 in civil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs to the Attorney General, and will agree to injunctive provisions aimed at preventing creams with high mercury levels from being sold through Amazon\u2019s website into California. The Attorney General\u2019s settlement will also resolve the claims of two Proposition 65 private enforcers, Larry Lee and As You Sow, the latter an environmental non-profit organization, which prior to Attorney General Bonta\u2019s investigation had discovered that Amazon had facilitated the sale of mercury-containing face creams in California, and had litigated against the company.\n\n\u201cAt the California Department of Justice, we are unwavering in our commitment to upholding laws that protect the safety and well-being of Californians,\u201d said Attorney General Bonta. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement reflects that commitment, and we will continue to hold accountable those who violate our state environmental and consumer laws.\u201d\n\nMercury is a powerful neurotoxin that impairs the nervous system, and prenatal exposure can impede normal development in fetuses and young children. Exposure to mercury can lead to irritability, muscle incoordination, memory loss, brain damage, and even death. Mercury is capable of being absorbed through skin, and the transfer of mercury from a consumer\u2019s hand to a common surface area can also create an exposure source for children and other household members.\n\nThe Attorney General investigated Amazon for facilitating third-party sales of skin-lightening face creams that contain mercury following lawsuits by the private enforcers. The California Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) investigation identified several face creams that contained very high mercury levels\u2014ranging from 121 to 16,000 parts per million, well in excess of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s maximum limit of 1 part per million\u2014and that required a warning about those mercury levels under Proposition 65. Amazon had failed to provide such warnings for creams sold through its site, thereby violating both Proposition 65 and the Unfair Competition Law.\n\nFollowing his investigation, the Attorney General asked Amazon to cease and desist from facilitating the sale of face creams identified as containing excessive mercury. Amazon, which does not manufacture these products, agreed to implement a sale-prevention protocol, or \u201csuppression rule,\u201d to prevent face creams with dangerous levels of mercury from being available for sale on its website.\n\nUnder the proposed consent judgment, Amazon will pay $218,560 in civil penalties to the Attorney General\u2019s Office pursuant to Proposition 65 and the Unfair Competition Law, $278,942 to reimburse a portion of the Attorney General\u2019s Office\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and $65,000 for future monitoring costs. Amazon will pay additional penalties and fees to resolve the claims of the private enforcers. The settlement also contains injunctive provisions, including that Amazon must do the following: continue to implement the suppression rule, and continuously adjust it to ensure that it remains effective; retain an independent product consultant who has significant experience with these skin-lightening products; and create a list of pre-approved brands that do not include mercury in their products.\n\nA copy of the complaint and proposed consent judgment, which remain subject to court approval, can be found here and here.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUPS will reduce the amount of Amazon volume it delivers by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 under an agreement in principle reached by the two companies, UPS announced Thursday.\n\nThe carrier determined if it took no action on its relationship with Amazon, it would likely result in diminishing returns, CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said on a Q4 earnings call.\n\n\"Amazon is our largest customer, but it's not our most profitable customer,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe agreement marks an acceleration of UPS' yearslong push to reduce its reliance on Amazon for volume and revenue. The carrier is striving to capture volume from more profitable segments like healthcare product shippers and small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAmazon has built out its own logistics network to deliver more customer orders itself but still uses a mix of carriers to cover the remainder of its orders. According to Amazon, it offered to increase UPS' volumes as the e-commerce giant\u2019s delivery needs continued to grow.\n\n\u201cDue to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement emailed to Supply Chain Dive. \"We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nEven with previous volume reduction efforts, Amazon still makes up a large portion of UPS' business. Executives said about 20% to 25% of volume in UPS' U.S. network is tied to Amazon, and the percentage of revenue derived from the company last year was 11.8%.\n\nThe decline in Amazon volume will lead to fewer packages being delivered by UPS, but at more profitable rates. In 2025, UPS expects average daily U.S. volume to drop about 8.5% year over year while revenue per package is projected to increase by 6%, per an earnings presentation.\n\n\"The results of this change will be lower overall volume levels, but an improved customer base at a significantly higher revenue per piece,\" EVP and CFO Brian Dykes said, adding that UPS will adjust its network as necessary to match capacity with demand.\n\nTom\u00e9 said she doesn't believe the remainder of Amazon's volume is on the chopping block, noting Amazon's reliance on The UPS Store locations for customer returns.\n\n\"I don't think it will go all away,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"I think we're landing at the right spot with this accelerated glide down.\"",

            "content": "A class of consumers sued Amazon.com, Inc. on Wednesday, claiming the technology company secretly tracked and sold their sensitive data without their consent.\n\nPlaintiff Felix Kolotinsky brought the class action lawsuit with a demand for a jury trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of California San Francisco Division on behalf of a group of California residents who claim the company\u2019s data collection practices violate California state law.\n\nKolotinsky alleged that the collected data includes \u201ctimestamped geolocation data that reveals where a consumer lives and works\u201d as well as personal information regarding consumers\u2019 religious beliefs, sexual orientation and medical history. The lawsuit states that the putative class members did not give Amazon permission to collect or sell such data and that there was no mechanism available for them to opt out of the company\u2019s data collection practice.\n\nThe plaintiff claims that the collecting and selling of such sensitive information violates \u00a7638.51 and \u00a7502 of the California Penal Code. \u00a7638.51 prohibits the installation of \u201cpen registers\u201d without prior court approval, and the statute defines a \u201cpen register\u201d as a \u201cdevice or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signalling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of communication.\u201d Kolotinsky claims that Amazon\u2019s software development kit (SDK) qualifies as a pen register because it timestamped information about consumers\u2019 geographic locations as well as information that could be used to identify consumers, such as device fingerprint data, from the consumers\u2019 cell phones.\n\n\u00a7502, known as the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA), protects consumers \u201cfrom tampering, interference, damage, and unauthorized access to lawfully created computer data and computer systems.\u201d The plaintiff argued that the class members\u2019 cell phones are \u201ccomputers\u201d or \u201ccomputer systems\u201d within the CDAFA\u2019s meaning since they can be used with external files and can perform functions including arithmetic, data storage, and communication. Kolotinsky asserts that Amazon knowingly accessed the putative class members\u2019 devices without permission and therefore violated the CDAFA.\n\nAn SDK is a code that platforms can provide to developers to build apps, allowing for various development tools to be stored in one place. Consumers, however, have noted concerns that the installation of an SDK into a mobile device allows platforms to track the device owner\u2019s personal data. In August 2024, a class action lawsuit brought against communications company Twilio alleged that the company\u2019s SDK violated multiple statutes, including the CDAFA. The putative class argued that Twilio secretly collected sensitive data from its consumers, such as their email addresses, names, and fingerprint data. Litigation in the case is still underway.\n\nConsumer protection and data privacy concerns have elevated in recent years, with numerous consumers and US states filing lawsuits against companies like Google, Apple and Allstate. Last week, the European Consumer Organization asked EU authorities to investigate whether Meta is violating consumer and data protection laws by using ambiguous terms and confusing interfaces that prevent users from consenting freely to data collection.",

            "content": "Amazon Haul is offering its deepest discounts yet, with some items reaching up to 90% off through layered promotions, as Amazon continues aggressive subsidization despite the looming changes to the de minimis import threshold.\n\nAmazon\u2019s 90% discount combines a 60% sitewide discount with an additional 20% off clearance items and 10% cart discount on orders over $75. This stacking of discounts means some items \u2013 for example, a sub-$1 Apple Watch strap \u2013 are selling for just 10% of their listed price. This level of discounting can turn a $79 cart filled with a dozen items into an $8 purchase \u2013 still with free shipping \u2013 suggesting Amazon is losing money on each sale to drive adoption.\n\nNow, even with Amazon offering up to 90% off through combined discounts, Haul\u2019s sales volume remains a fraction of Temu\u2019s. Still, the number of Amazon Haul products in Amazon\u2019s top 100 best seller lists has grown to highs of 4,200 in January \u2013 up from under 1,000 prior to a momentary Black Friday peak of 2,700 \u2013 this growth has come at an increasing cost.\n\nEven after introducing sponsored product ads in January \u2013 a revenue stream not present at launch \u2013 Amazon appears to be subsidizing most orders to maintain competitive prices against Temu.\n\nThe addition of sponsored placements suggests Amazon is already looking for ways to offset these losses, even before establishing meaningful market share. At current prices, though, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where sellers dedicate meaningful budgets to this new advertising real estate without further subsidies.\n\nThis aggressive discounting strategy comes as Congress prepares to eliminate the de minimis threshold that allows Chinese goods under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.\n\nThe changes would significantly impact both Amazon Haul and Temu\u2019s current business models, which rely heavily on direct shipments from China.\n\nThe challenge for Amazon is that Temu has fundamentally changed customer expectations for direct-from-China commerce. While Amazon historically succeeded by making shopping more convenient, Temu proved that many shoppers will accept slower delivery times for significantly lower prices. Now, even with Amazon offering up to 90% off through combined discounts, Haul\u2019s sales volume remains a fraction of Temu\u2019s.\n\nAmazon has a history of subsidizing growth \u2013 Prime membership operated at a loss for years while building market share. However, the timing of these Haul discounts, just as the de minimis loophole is set to close, raises questions about the long-term strategy. Once duty-free imports end, both Haul and Temu will need to fundamentally restructure their operations, likely leading to higher prices and slower delivery times.\n\nThe question remains whether Amazon can convert the current discount-driven traffic into loyal customers before the regulatory changes force a pivot. For now, the mounting losses on each sale suggest Amazon is racing against time to establish Haul as a viable alternative to Temu, even as the window for the current business model appears to be closing.",

            "content": "In production generative AI applications, responsiveness is just as important as the intelligence behind the model. Whether it\u2019s customer service teams handling time-sensitive inquiries or developers needing instant code suggestions, every second of delay, known as latency, can have a significant impact. As businesses increasingly use large language models (LLMs) for these critical tasks and processes, they face a fundamental challenge: how to maintain the quick, responsive performance users expect while delivering the high-quality outputs these sophisticated models promise.\n\nThe impact of latency on user experience extends beyond mere inconvenience. In interactive AI applications, delayed responses can break the natural flow of conversation, diminish user engagement, and ultimately affect the adoption of AI-powered solutions. This challenge is compounded by the increasing complexity of modern LLM applications, where multiple LLM calls are often needed to solve a single problem, significantly increasing total processing times.\n\nDuring re:Invent 2024, we launched latency-optimized inference for foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock. This new inference feature provides reduced latency for Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Haiku model and Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 405B and 70B models compared to their standard versions. This feature is especially helpful for time-sensitive workloads where rapid response is business critical.\n\nIn this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference can help address the challenges of maintaining responsiveness in LLM applications. We\u2019ll dive deep into strategies for optimizing application performance and improving user experience. Whether you\u2019re building a new AI application or optimizing an existing one, you\u2019ll find practical guidance on both the technical aspects of latency optimization and real-world implementation approaches. We begin by explaining latency in LLM applications.\n\nUnderstanding latency in LLM applications\n\nLatency in LLM applications is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond simple response times. When you interact with an LLM, you can receive responses in one of two ways: streaming or nonstreaming mode. In nonstreaming mode, you wait for the complete response before receiving any output\u2014like waiting for someone to finish writing a letter. In streaming mode, you receive the response as it\u2019s being generated\u2014like watching someone type in real time.\n\nTo effectively optimize AI applications for responsiveness, we need to understand the key metrics that define latency and how they impact user experience. These metrics differ between streaming and nonstreaming modes and understanding them is crucial for building responsive AI applications.\n\nTime to first token (TTFT) represents how quickly your streaming application starts responding. It\u2019s the amount of time from when a user submits a request until they receive the beginning of a response (the first word, token, or chunk). Think of it as the initial reaction time of your AI application.\n\nTTFT is affected by several factors:\n\nLength of your input prompt (longer prompts generally mean higher TTFT)\n\nNetwork conditions and geographic location (if the prompt is getting processed in a different region, it will take longer)\n\nCalculation: TTFT = Time to first chunk/token \u2013 Time from request submission\n\nInterpretation: Lower is better\n\nOutput tokens per second (OTPS) indicates how quickly your model generates new tokens after it starts responding. This metric is crucial for understanding the actual throughput of your model and how it maintains its response speed throughout longer generations.\n\nOTPS is influenced by:\n\nModel size and complexity\n\nLength of the generated response\n\nComplexity of the task and prompt\n\nSystem load and resource availability\n\nCalculation: OTPS = Total number of output tokens / Total generation time\n\nInterpretation: Higher is better\n\nEnd-to-end latency (E2E) measures the total time from request to complete response. As illustrated in the figure above, this encompasses the entire interaction.\n\nKey factors affecting this metric include:\n\nInput prompt length\n\nRequested output length\n\nModel processing speed\n\nNetwork conditions\n\nComplexity of the task and prompt\n\nPostprocessing requirements (for example, using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails or other quality checks)\n\nCalculation: E2E latency = Time at completion of request \u2013 Time from request submission\n\nInterpretation: Lower is better\n\nAlthough these metrics provide a solid foundation for understanding latency, there are additional factors and considerations that can impact the perceived performance of LLM applications. These metrics are shown in the following diagram.\n\nThe role of tokenization\n\nAn often-overlooked aspect of latency is how different models tokenize text differently. Each model\u2019s tokenization strategy is defined by its provider during training and can\u2019t be modified. For example, a prompt that generates 100 tokens in one model might generate 150 tokens in another. When comparing model performance, remember that these inherent tokenization differences can affect perceived response times, even when the models are equally efficient. Awareness of this variation can help you better interpret latency differences between models and make more informed decisions when selecting models for your applications.\n\nUnderstanding user experience\n\nThe psychology of waiting in AI applications reveals interesting patterns about user expectations and satisfaction. Users tend to perceive response times differently based on the context and complexity of their requests. A slight delay in generating a complex analysis might be acceptable, and even a small lag in a conversational exchange can feel disruptive. This understanding helps us set appropriate optimization priorities for different types of applications.\n\nConsistency over speed\n\nConsistent response times, even if slightly slower, often lead to better user satisfaction than highly variable response times with occasional quick replies. This is crucial for streaming responses and implementing optimization strategies.\n\nKeeping users engaged\n\nWhen processing times are longer, simple indicators such as \u201cProcessing your request\u201d or \u201cloading animations\u201d messages help keep users engaged, especially during the initial response time. In such scenarios, you want to optimize for TTFT.\n\nBalancing speed, quality, and cost\n\nOutput quality often matters more than speed. Users prefer accurate responses over quick but less reliable ones. Consider benchmarking your user experience to find the best latency for your use case, considering that most humans can\u2019t read faster than 225 words per minute and therefore extremely fast response can hinder user experience.\n\nBy understanding these nuances, you can make more informed decisions to optimize your AI applications for better user experience.\n\nLatency-optimized inference: A deep dive\n\nAmazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference capabilities are designed to provide higher OTPS and quicker TTFT, enabling applications to handle workloads more reliably. This optimization is available in the US East (Ohio) AWS Region for select FMs, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Haiku and Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 models (both 405B and 70B versions). The optimization supports the following models:\n\nHigher OTPS \u2013 Faster token generation after the model starts responding\n\n\u2013 Faster token generation after the model starts responding Quicker TTFT \u2013 Faster initial response time\n\nImplementation\n\nTo enable latency optimization, you need to set the latency parameter to optimized in your API calls:\n\n# Using converse api without streaming response = bedrock_runtime.converse( modelId='us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0', messages=[{ 'role': 'user', 'content': [{ 'text':'Write a story about music generating AI models' }] }], performanceConfig={'latency': 'optimized'} ) For streaming responses: # using converse API with streaming response = bedrock_runtime.converse_stream( modelId='us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0', messages=[{ 'role': 'user', 'content': [{ 'text':'Write a story about music generating AI models' }] }], performanceConfig={'latency': 'optimized'} )\n\nBenchmarking methodology and results\n\nTo understand the performance gains both for TTFT and OTPS, we conducted an offline experiment with around 1,600 API calls spread across various hours of the day and across multiple days. We used a dummy dataset comprising different task types: sequence-counting, story-writing, summarization, and translation. The input prompt ranged from 100 tokens to 100,000 tokens, and the output tokens ranged from 100 to 1,000 output tokens. These tasks were chosen to represent varying complexity levels and various model output lengths. Our test setup was hosted in the US West (Oregon) us-west-2 Region, and both the optimized and standard models were hosted in US East (Ohio) us-east-2 Region. This cross-Region setup introduced realistic network variability, helping us measure performance under conditions similar to real-world applications.\n\nWhen analyzing the results, we focused on the key latency metrics discussed earlier: TTFT and OTPS. As a quick recap, lower TTFT values indicate faster initial response times, and higher OTPS values represent faster token generation speeds. We also looked at the 50th percentile (P50) and 90th percentile (P90) values to understand both typical performance and performance boundaries under challenging or upper bound conditions. Following the central limit theorem, we observed that, with sufficient samples, our results converged toward consistent values, providing reliable performance indicators.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these results are from our specific test environment and datasets. Your actual results may vary based on your specific use case, prompt length, expected model response length, network conditions, client location, and other implementation components. When conducting your own benchmarks, make sure your test dataset represents your actual production workload characteristics, including typical input lengths and expected output patterns.\n\nBenchmark results\n\nOur experiments with the latency-optimized models revealed substantial performance improvements across both TTFT and OTPS metrics. The results in the following table show the comparison between standard and optimized versions of Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Haiku and Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 70B models. For each model, we ran multiple iterations of our test scenarios to promote reliable performance. The improvements were particularly notable in high-percentile measurements, suggesting more consistent performance even under challenging conditions.\n\nModel Inference profile TTFT P50 (in seconds) TTFT P90 (in seconds) OTPS P50 OTPS P90 us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0 Optimized 0.6 1.4 85.9 152.0 us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0 Standard 1.1 2.9 48.4 67.4 Improvement -42.20% -51.70% 77.34% 125.50% us.meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0 Optimized 0.4 1.2 137.0 203.7 us.meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0 Standard 0.9 42.8 30.2 32.4 Improvement -51.65% -97.10% 353.84% 529.33%\n\nThese results demonstrate significant improvements across all metrics for both models. For Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Haiku model, the optimized version achieved up to 42.20% reduction in TTFT P50 and up to 51.70% reduction in TTFT P90, indicating more consistent initial response times. Additionally, the OTPS saw improvements of up to 77.34% at the P50 level and up to 125.50% at the P90 level, enabling faster token generation.\n\nThe gains for Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 70B model are even more impressive, with the optimized version achieving up to 51.65% reduction in TTFT P50 and up to 97.10% reduction in TTFT P90, providing consistently rapid initial responses. Furthermore, the OTPS saw a massive boost, with improvements of up to 353.84% at the P50 level and up to 529.33% at the P90 level, enabling up to 5x faster token generation in some scenarios.\n\nAlthough these benchmark results show the powerful impact of latency-optimized inference, they represent just one piece of the optimization puzzle. To make best use of these performance improvements and achieve the best possible response times for your specific use case, you\u2019ll need to consider additional optimization strategies beyond merely enabling the feature.\n\nComprehensive guide to LLM latency optimization\n\nEven though Amazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference offers great improvements from the start, getting the best performance requires a well-rounded approach to designing and implementing your application. In the next section, we explore some other strategies and considerations to make your application as responsive as possible.\n\nPrompt engineering for latency optimization\n\nWhen optimizing LLM applications for latency, the way you craft your prompts affects both input processing and output generation.\n\nTo optimize your input prompts, follow these recommendations:\n\nKeep prompts concise \u2013 Long input prompts take more time to process and increase TTFT. Create short, focused prompts that prioritize necessary context and information.\n\n\u2013 Long input prompts take more time to process and increase TTFT. Create short, focused prompts that prioritize necessary context and information. Break down complex tasks \u2013 Instead of handling large tasks in a single request, break them into smaller, manageable chunks. This approach helps maintain responsiveness regardless of task complexity.\n\n\u2013 Instead of handling large tasks in a single request, break them into smaller, manageable chunks. This approach helps maintain responsiveness regardless of task complexity. Smart context management \u2013 For interactive applications such as chatbots, include only relevant context instead of entire conversation history.\n\n\u2013 For interactive applications such as chatbots, include only relevant context instead of entire conversation history. Token management \u2013 Different models tokenize text differently, meaning the same input can result in different numbers of tokens. Monitor and optimize token usage to keep performance consistent. Use token budgeting to balance context preservation with performance needs.\n\nTo engineer for brief outputs, follow these recommendations:\n\nEngineer for brevity \u2013 Include explicit length constraints in your prompts (for example, \u201crespond in 50 words or less\u201d)\n\n\u2013 Include explicit length constraints in your prompts (for example, \u201crespond in 50 words or less\u201d) Use system messages \u2013 Set response length constraints through system messages\n\n\u2013 Set response length constraints through system messages Balance quality and length \u2013 Make sure response constraints don\u2019t compromise output quality\n\nOne of the best ways to make your AI application feel faster is to use streaming. Instead of waiting for the complete response, streaming shows the response as it\u2019s being generated\u2014like watching someone type in real-time. Streaming the response is one of the most effective ways to improve perceived performance in LLM applications maintaining user engagement.\n\nThese techniques can significantly reduce token usage and generation time, improving both latency and cost-efficiency.\n\nBuilding production-ready AI applications\n\nAlthough individual optimizations are important, production applications require a holistic approach to latency management. In this section, we explore how different system components and architectural decisions impact overall application responsiveness.\n\nSystem architecture and end-to-end latency considerations\n\nIn production environments, overall system latency extends far beyond model inference time. Each component in your AI application stack contributes to the total latency experienced by users. For instance, when implementing responsible AI practices through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, you might notice a small additional latency overhead. Similar considerations apply when integrating content filtering, user authentication, or input validation layers. Although each component serves a crucial purpose, their cumulative impact on latency requires careful consideration during system design.\n\nGeographic distribution plays a significant role in application performance. Model invocation latency can vary considerably depending on whether calls originate from different Regions, local machines, or different cloud providers. This variation stems from data travel time across networks and geographic distances. When designing your application architecture, consider factors such as the physical distance between your application and model endpoints, cross-Region data transfer times, and network reliability in different Regions. Data residency requirements might also influence these architectural choices, potentially necessitating specific Regional deployments.\n\nIntegration patterns significantly impact how users perceive application performance. Synchronous processing, although simpler to implement, might not always provide the best user experience. Consider implementing asynchronous patterns where appropriate, such as pre-fetching likely responses based on user behavior patterns or processing noncritical components in the background. Request batching for bulk operations can also help optimize overall system throughput, though it requires careful balance with response time requirements.\n\nAs applications scale, additional infrastructure components become necessary but can impact latency. Load balancers, queue systems, cache layers, and monitoring systems all contribute to the overall latency budget. Understanding these components\u2019 impact helps in making informed decisions about infrastructure design and optimization strategies.\n\nComplex tasks often require orchestrating multiple model calls or breaking down problems into subtasks. Consider a content generation system that first uses a fast model to generate an outline, then processes different sections in parallel, and finally uses another model for coherence checking and refinement. This orchestration approach requires careful attention to cumulative latency impact while maintaining output quality. Each step needs appropriate timeouts and fallback mechanisms to provide reliable performance under various conditions.\n\nPrompt caching for enhanced performance\n\nAlthough our focus is on latency-optimized inference, it\u2019s worth noting that Amazon Bedrock also offers prompt caching (in preview) to optimize for both cost and latency. This feature is particularly valuable for applications that frequently reuse context, such as document-based chat assistants or applications with repetitive query patterns. When combined with latency-optimized inference, prompt caching can provide additional performance benefits by reducing the processing overhead for frequently used contexts.\n\nPrompt routing for intelligent model selection\n\nSimilar to prompt caching, Amazon Bedrock Intelligent Prompt Routing (in preview) is another powerful optimization feature. This capability automatically directs requests to different models within the same model family based on the complexity of each prompt. For example, simple queries can be routed to faster, more cost-effective models, and complex requests that require deeper understanding are directed to more sophisticated models. This automatic routing helps optimize both performance and cost without requiring manual intervention.\n\nArchitectural considerations and caching\n\nApplication architecture plays a crucial role in overall latency optimization. Consider implementing a multitiered caching strategy that includes response caching for frequently requested information and smart context management for historical information. This isn\u2019t only about storing exact matches\u2014consider implementing semantic caching that can identify and serve responses to similar queries.\n\nBalancing model sophistication, latency, and cost\n\nIn AI applications, there\u2019s a constant balancing act between model sophistication, latency, and cost, as illustrated in the diagram. Although more advanced models often provide higher quality outputs, they might not always meet strict latency requirements. In such cases, using a less sophisticated but faster model might be the better choice. For instance, in applications requiring near-instantaneous responses, opting for a smaller, more efficient model could be necessary to meet latency goals, even if it means a slight trade-off in output quality. This approach aligns with the broader need to optimize the interplay between cost, speed, and quality in AI systems.\n\nFeatures such as Amazon Bedrock Intelligent Prompt Routing help manage this balance effectively. By automatically handling model selection based on request complexity, you can optimize for all three factors\u2014quality, speed, and cost\u2014without requiring developers to commit to a single model for all requests.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explored throughout this post, optimizing LLM application latency involves multiple strategies, from using latency-optimized inference and prompt caching to implementing intelligent routing and careful prompt engineering. The key is to combine these approaches in a way that best suits your specific use case and requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nMaking your AI application fast and responsive isn\u2019t a one-time task, it\u2019s an ongoing process of testing and improvement. Amazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference gives you a great starting point, and you\u2019ll notice significant improvements when you combine it with the strategies we\u2019ve discussed.\n\nReady to get started?

Soon after switching to the tablet, I passed off my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation) to my daughter and my 2020 iPad to my husband. Then I tried the latest Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition and I'm not sure I can give it up.\n\nAlso: Why I pick this ultraportable Lenovo tablet over the iPad Air for mobile entertainment\n\nThe TCL tablet offers full-color, color paper, and black-and-white paper mode, so you get the full experience of a tablet and an e-reader. I love that I can turn pages and navigate the Kindle app on the TCL as quickly as I can on a smartphone or a tablet while still looking like an e-reader and putting my slow, six-year-old Kindle to shame.\n\nWhen Amazon unveiled its new Kindle lineup, I fell for it like a ripe coconut falls on a sunny beach. I've been a Kindle user for over 12 years, religiously reading each night before bed. While a new Kindle may not seem too exciting considering the device's simplicity, the 2024 lineup of Kindles is Amazon's largest upgrade in years, offering the first full-color Kindle and the fastest page turns yet.\n\nAlthough the TCL Nxtpaper tablet has many benefits, the Kindle Paperwhite SE has several key advantages that have made me reach for it more than the TCL. Most importantly, the new Kindle Paperwhite weighs just 7.5 ounces and features a smaller seven-inch display than my tablet. This makes it easier to hold the Kindle in one hand, something I struggled with daily with the 10-inch, 16.9-oz TCL tablet.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nNobody wants to carry around a 1lb book, especially if you read for long periods and like to hold your e-reader in one hand.\n\nSize and weight aside, the Kindle Paperwhite SE has up to 12 weeks of battery life on a single charge. This is based on a half hour of reading per day with the wireless off and the light setting at 13, so your mileage may vary.\n\nAlso: One of the best productivity tablets I've tested is not an iPad Pro or Remarkable\n\nMy TCL tablet, in turn, offers about 20 hours, which is impressive for a tablet. I charge it about once a week and read for about an hour each night.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nI've been using the Kindle Paperwhite for about two weeks and haven't needed to charge it after the initial charge. This is pretty typical for a Kindle; my 10th-generation Kindle Paperwhite lasted about three weeks, reading with the backlight for just under an hour a day.\n\nAfter two weeks of daily reading on a single charge, some days for up to three hours a day, my Kindle Paperwhite's battery is still at 32%. According to Amazon, the Kindle Paperwhite could last about 42 hours of reading with the brightness at 13.\n\nAlso: The iPad I bring with me everywhere is not the Pro or Air model\n\nConsidering I've read about 29.5 hours in the past two weeks, and the battery is at 32%, the estimations seem pretty accurate.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nAside from a long battery life, the fastest page turns I've seen on a Kindle, and the benefit of a lightweight, compact e-reader, the Kindle Paperwhite SE also has the advantage of being a dedicated, distraction-free reading device.\n\nThe Signature Edition also features 32GB of storage and support for wireless charging.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nYou don't have to worry about notifications or distractions from social media or other apps tearing you away from your reading, as a Kindle is a simple device that only fulfills your reading hobby.\n\nAlso: The best e-readers of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nKindle e-readers are built to last several years, so I'd recommend the Kindle Paperwhite to anyone upgrading from a three-year or older Kindle. I typically use my Kindles for six years, but I could see this new Kindle Paperwhite lasting eight years or longer, making the purchase even more worthwhile.",

Measuring approximately 5,000 sq. ft. with front of house measuring approximately 2,400 sq. ft., the store is an Amazon Go format developed specifically for suburban locations offering an expanded selection of grab-and-go food and beverage items, including a broader range of beer and wine, and a made-to-order kitchen.\n\nThe Woodland Hills Amazon Go store will operate normally until it closes Feb. 26. Two other Amazon Go stores currently operating in the Greater Los Angeles area will remain open. Amazon is working with all affected employees to find new roles within the company.\n\nThe Amazon Go format debuted at a store in Seattle in January 2018 . It features Amazon\u2019s \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology, and is designed to offer customers a quick shopping experience to pick up grab-and-go food, snacks and beverage items and a few everyday essentials.\n\nAccording to the Amazon website, it currently operates 16 Amazon Go locations (including the Woodland Hills store slated for closure) across California, Illinois, New York and Washington.\n\nAmazon operated a peak of approximately 30 Amazon Go stores in 2023 but then began gradually shrinking the format\u2019s footprint with the closure of eight locations in March 2023.",

Services teams are listening to your feedback and developing little (or big) changes that makes your life easier when working with our services. The ability to support multiple sessions in the AWS Console is my favorite one so far in 2025.\n\nBut our teams didn\u2019t stop there, let\u2019s look at the last week\u2019s new announcements.\n\nLast week\u2019s launches\n\nBeside the usual Regional expansion (new capabilities that are now available in a new Region), here are the launches that got my attention.\n\nAmazon EventBridge announces direct delivery to cross-account targets \u2013 Amazon EventBridge is now able to deliver events to targets in another AWS account directly without having to send them to the default bus in the target account first. This will simplify so many architectures out there! It supports any target that supports resource-based policies, including AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon API Gateway.\n\nAmazon Corretto quaterly update \u2013 We announced quarterly security and critical updates for Amazon Corretto Long-Term Supported (LTS) and Feature Release (FR) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 23.0.2, 21.0.6, 17.0.14, 11.0.26, 8u442 are now available for download. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. You can download the updates from the Corretto home page or just type apt-get or yum update .\n\nHigh-throughput mode for Amazon SNS FIFO Topics \u2013 Amazon SNS now supports high-throughput mode for SNS FIFO topics, with default throughput matching SNS standard topics across all Regions. When you enable high-throughput mode, SNS FIFO topics will maintain order within message group, while reducing the deduplication scope to the message-group level. With this change, you can leverage up to 30K messages per second (MPS) per account by default in US East (N. Virginia) Region, and 9K MPS per account in US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) Regions, and request quota increases for additional throughput in any Region.\n\nAmazon Connect agent workspace now supports audio optimization for Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops \u2013 Amazon Connect agent workspace now supports the ability to redirect audio from Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments to a customer service agent\u2019s local device. Audio redirection improves voice quality and reduces latency for voice calls handled on virtual desktops, providing a better experience for both end customers and agents.\n\nAmazon Redshift announces support for History Mode for zero-ETL integrations \u2013 This new capability enables you to build Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD 2) tables on your historical data from databases, out-of-the-box in Amazon Redshift, without writing any code. History mode simplifies the process of tracking and analyzing historical data changes, allowing you to gain valuable insights from your data\u2019s evolution over time.\n\nFinally, Amazon Bedrock has its own set of announcements. First, for anyone investing in retrieval-augmented generation, Bedrock now support multimodal content with Cohere Embed 3 Multilingual and Embed 3 English models. This enables you to create embeddings to not only index text, but also images.\n\nSecond, read Luma AI\u2019s Ray2 visual AI model now available in Amazon Bedrock. Luma Ray2 is a large-scale video-generation model capable of creating realistic visuals with fluid, natural movement. With Luma Ray2 in Amazon Bedrock, you can generate production-ready video clips with seamless animations, ultrarealistic details, and logical event sequences with natural language prompts, removing the need for technical prompt engineering. Ray2 currently supports 5- and 9-second video generations with 540p and 720p resolution.\n\nAnd finally, Amazon Bedrock Flows announces preview of multi-turn conversation support. Amazon Bedrock Flows enables you to link foundation models (FMs), Amazon Bedrock Prompts, Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and other AWS services together to build and scale pre-defined generative AI workflows. This week, the team announced preview of multi-turn conversation support for agent nodes in Flows. This capability enables dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue.\n\nOther AWS events\n\nCheck your calendar and sign up for upcoming AWS events.\n\nAWS Summits season is starting! I\u2019m already working with the local team to prepare content for the Summits in Paris and London. Summits are free online and in-person events that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS. Stay updated by visiting the official AWS Summit website and sign up for notifications to learn when registration opens for events in your area.\n\nAWS GenAI Lofts are collaborative spaces and immersive experiences that showcase AWS expertise in cloud computing and AI. They provide startups and developers with hands-on access to AI products and services, exclusive sessions with industry leaders, and valuable networking opportunities with investors and peers. Find a GenAI Loft location near you, and don\u2019t forget to register.\n\nBrowse all upcoming AWS led in-person and virtual events here.\n\nThat\u2019s all for this week.

            "content": "Amazon Ads is rolling out Brand+, a new offering for advertisers that combines what it estimates are \u201ctrillions of signals\u201d from shopping, browsing and streaming across its footprint.\n\nThe aim of the data-powered offering is to identify consumers who are predicted to be in the market for a brand\u2019s product or service within the next three months.\n\nMarketers can use Brand+ to deliver their messages on video streaming platforms like Prime Video and Twitch as well as top video publishers like BuzzFeed, Fox Corp. and Dotdash Meredith, Amazon said. In addition to its own platforms, Amazon is also a massive gateway to the broader streaming marketplace with Fire TV connected devices and the Amazon Channels store offering access to tens of millions of households beyond Prime and Twitch.\n\nDuring Brand+ beta testing, Amazon Ads said, some advertisers experienced a sales increase of more than 10% increase and a website traffic jump of more than 70%.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSimplifying the buying process is a key goal of Brand+, with Amazon Ads affirming that inventory can be purchased via the platform in as few as four clicks.\n\n\u201cFor the first time on the Amazon DSP, advertisers can apply AI-optimized automation to purchase TV advertising that reaches unique audiences of customers most likely to buy their products or services \u2013 a significant advancement from broad demographic reach to engaging with scaled audiences based on where customers are in the marketing funnel in near real-time,\u201d said Kelly MacLean, VP of Amazon DSP. \u201cWith this advanced AI technology, the Amazon DSP enables advertisers and agencies to automatically reach, engage, and nurture potential customers throughout their journey, turning brand awareness into a strategic driver of conversions.\u201d\n\nIn one hypothetical use case offered by Amazon Ads, a travel company looking to drive awareness among their highest potential customers could upload their first-party signals to the Amazon DSP. Brand+ would then analyze these signals and incorporate with Amazon Ads shopping and streaming signals to power machine learning, identify valuable patterns and recognize customers who have searched for travel gear, bought travel guides, and streamed travel shows. Brand+ then delivers TV ads for the travel services to this audience of potential customers.\n\nThe relevance of the resulting ads, as envisioned by Amazon, would fulfill the longtime promise of streaming. Unlike the \u201cspray-and-pray\u201d mode of linear TV, streaming can harness digital technology to give ads more traction for both seller and audience, at least under the industry\u2019s long-held theory. Any viewer of ad-supported streaming platforms can attest that the industry has not arrived at Valhalla just yet.\n\nRajiv Ragu, SVP of Growth at wellness company Thorne, said Brand+ has been a \u201cgame changer\u201d during its beta phase, increasing reach, brand engagement and returns on ad spending. \u201cGiven the success we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re doubling down on our STV strategy in 2025 and are laser focused on Brand+,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see the positive momentum and are looking forward to its continued impact for our brand and customers.\u201d",

The tool uses AI to analyze shopping, browsing, and streaming signals and then optimizes ad buys across streaming TV and online video to target an audience who is most likely to buy an advertiser\u2019s product.\n\nThe goal is to bring more of a performance focus to TV advertising, which is traditionally seen as an upper-funnel, brand awareness play.\n\nBrand+ is the newest example of how Amazon is trying to win over big-spending TV advertisers. Amazon\u2019s search and digital ads have long focused on driving conversions, and Amazon hopes to do the same with TV ads as it builds out a large streaming ad business.\n\nUsing Amazon DSP, \u201cadvertisers can apply AI-optimized automation to purchase TV advertising that reaches unique audiences of customers most likely to buy their products or services,\u201d Kelly MacLean, vice president of Amazon DSP, said in a statement. The tool, \u201c[turns] brand awareness into a strategic driver of conversions.\u201d\n\nThrough Brand+, advertisers can buy ads across Amazon-owned properties including Prime Video and Twitch as well as video publishers like Buzzfeed, Fox Corporation, and Dotdash Meredith. Amazon sells some ads for these publishers in exchange for earning a cut of ad revenue.\n\nIn beta testing, Amazon said that some advertisers saw a 10% increase in sales and over 70% increase in website traffic.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more ROAS and better reach with customers that engage with our brand over time,\u201d said Rajiv Ragu, senior vice president of growth at Thorne, in a statement. Thorne\u2014a vitamin and supplement company\u2014participated in Amazon\u2019s beta test with Brand+. \u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on our STV strategy in 2025 and are laser focused on Brand+,\u201d Ragu added.\n\nBrand+ is basically an upper-funnel pairing to another one of Amazon\u2019s tools in Amazon DSP called Performance+. Performance+ uses AI to find audiences most likely to convert on digital ads.\n\nBolstering Amazon\u2019s retail media dominance\n\nBrand+ pushes Amazon further ahead of competitors in the retail media space, noted Mike Feldman, senior vice president and global head of retail media at VaynerMedia. He said that it\u2019s a compelling play as Amazon aims to convince more clients to use Amazon DSP as their primary DSP over alternatives like Google or The Trade Desk.\n\n\u201cAmazon has more data and is using it more effectively than everyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the new tool will likely help ecommerce-first advertisers identify new or specific audiences more efficiently, Feldman said it also creates an opportunity for advertisers that don\u2019t sell direct-to-consumer online or via Amazon. Because it allows brands to target ads based on such a wide range of data, non-endemic advertisers like automakers and finance companies are also likely to benefit.\n\n\u201cThe more that you plug into Amazon\u2019s [retail media business], the more effective that\u2019s going to be, because they just have such a ridiculous amount of data,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cTo think any brand can do it on their own, or couldn\u2019t do it better with Amazon, seems really short-sighted.\u201d",

Today, at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival Producers Celebration presented by Amazon MGM Studios, held at The Park in Park City, Utah, producers of films featured in the program came together for the Sundance Institute | Amazon MGM Studios Producers Awards and a keynote address by David Hinojosa, producer and partner at 2AM who has produced Babygirl, The Brutalist, and Past Lives, among others. Winners of the Sundance Institute | Amazon MGM Studios Producers Awards were announced, with two $10,000 grants \u2014 one for fiction and the other for nonfiction \u2014 awarded to producers Joe Pirro (The Wedding Banquet) and Danielle Varga (Seeds). Both films are premiering at the 2025 Festival. Other speakers included Sundance Institute\u2019s Amanda Kelso, Michelle Satter, Kristin Feeley, Shira Rockowitz, and Maria Clement, as well as a spokesperson from Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nDavid Hinojosa is an Academy Award\u2013nominated producer most recently known for Babygirl, Past Lives, and The Brutalist. In 2020, he co-founded 2AM. Previously at Killer Films, he produced acclaimed titles including Beatriz at Dinner, Still Alice, First Reformed, Carol, and Zola. He is active in Producers United and the PGA and lectures at NYU.\n\nHighlights from David Honojosa\u2019s keynote include:\n\n[On discovering his passion for producing] \u201cOnce I figured out what filmmaking was \u2014 make mini-dv cam videos about dog, read screenplays anyway I could find them, listen to every DVD director commentary, write college essay about Paul Thomas Anderson and, finally, go to film school \u2014 I could move on to sorting out what producing was. And boy did I have some great guides along the way: Anne Carey, Ted Hope, Pam Koffler and Christine Vachon, just to name a few. These people were total heroes to me. Reading Christine Vachon\u2019s book and then working with Pam and her literally changed the course of my professional life.\u201d\n\n[On the responsibility of producers] \u201cWe must fuel our own self-renewal. No one\u2019s going to fix it for us. As the textbook definition of \u201cdoers,\u201d it\u2019s exactly that we must activate. And we are so lucky that we have a job that rewards creative entrepreneurship. But I also know for sure \u2014 we have to rely on the people in this room. We have to pool our talents, famously impossible to define or fit in a job description. We have to harness it all.\u201d\n\n[On how producers can affect change in the industry] \u201cIn a world where power dynamics are constantly shifting, it\u2019s crucial to remember the unique position we occupy. Our power lies not just in our ability to make films, but in our capacity to inspire, to challenge, and, you could say, to bring people to our cause.\u201d\n\n[On the impact of Sundance and Producers Program] \u201cI\u2019m proud that this festival often showcases work that challenges, affirms or refracts that bigger American story. And this year\u2026 we\u2019ve become one of those stories. I see more than a few faces from Producer\u2019s United in the room. A group of folks that are often pitted against each other are instead joining forces to solve a really big problem. By addressing inequalities affecting producers of all kinds, including commencement wages and healthcare, we\u2019re taking control of our destiny and assuring the sustainability of this career path. This collective effort, supported by the Producers Branch of the Academy, the PGA, and the Producer Program at the Sundance Institute, also demonstrates the power of unity in our community. So \u2013 will we act on that power? The moment is ours to do so.\u201d\n\n[Closing words] \u201cIn many ways, I\u2019m still the same internet-loving kid from Indiana \u2013 sassy, talkative, and short. But now I have this outlet and this canvas. A place to put the cocktail of random skills, open computer tabs, and obsessions to work. And best of all, a creative community that works together and builds coalition. We must look out for one another. And in doing so, we\u2019ll not only adapt to the changing industry but also shape its future, ensuring that the art of producing remains as vital and impactful as ever.\u201d\n\nRecipients of the 2025 Sundance Institute | Amazon MGM Studios Producers Awards were announced during the event, where they each received a $10,000 grant:\n\nThe Amazon MGM Studios Fiction Producers Award was given to producer Joe Pirro, producer for The Wedding Banquet, which is premiering in the Premieres section at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\n\nJoe Pirro is Head of Production at James Schamus\u2019 company Symbolic Exchange and based in New York City. In addition to Andrew Ahn\u2019s The Wedding Banquet, recent producing credits include Ahn\u2019s Driveways, Mike Ott\u2019s McVeigh, and Minhal Baig\u2019s We Grown Now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Amazon MGM Studios Nonfiction Producers Award was given to Danielle Varga, producer for Seeds, which premiered in the U.S. Documentary Competition at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\n\nDanielle Varga has been producing award-winning nonfiction films for the past decade. In addition to Brittany Shyne\u2019s Seeds, she has produced Brett Story\u2019s The Hottest August, Todd Chandler\u2019s Bulletproof, Vicky Du\u2019s Light of the Setting Sun, and Rachel Elizabeth Seed\u2019s A Photographic Memory, and she co-produced Kirsten Johnson\u2019s Cameraperson.\n\nThe Sundance Institute Producers Program is supported by an endowment from the Sandra and Malcolm Berman Charitable Foundation, with generous additional support from John D. and Catherine T.

For example, you can create a routine in the app for it to turn on your coffee machine at a certain time (allowing you to wake up to fresh java).\n\nIt's exclusively set up for Alexa and won't work with other voice assistants. And note that a smart home hub is not required to use the plug.\n\nWhat reviewers are saying\n\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f 17,000+ ratings\n\n\u2b50 4.6/5 stars\n\n\ud83c\udfc5 \"I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t buy one sooner.\"\n\nOne shopper said that they agree it does \"work like a charm\" for automatically turning off lights around the house. They continued to say they \"highly recommend\" it to others. \"This is such a game changer,\" echoed another.\n\nAnother reviewer noted that the plug was great for turning off their lights even while out of the country.\n\nA fourth shopper claimed the plug made life \"easier\" now that they don't have to get up to turn off all their lights.\n\nOthers also noted that the device is great for turning their Christmas lights on and off, as well as turning their air conditioner on in the summer.\n\nHowever, while 76 per cent of reviews were a 5-star rating, some shoppers said set up isn't as easy as it's touted to be, with one reviewer going as far to say it's \"impossible to set up.\" Some shoppers also caution that connection can be dicey.\n\nA few reviewers also weren't happy with the fact that the plug is only compatible with Alexa, and wish it was more versatile.\n\nThe verdict\n\nWith more than 13,000 5-star reviews, many Amazon shoppers say the Amazon Smart Plug is an easy way to streamline your home's electronics. However, if you're not ultra-tech savvy, shoppers cautioned it can be a pain to set up \u2014 and of course, you'll want to make sure your devices are compatible.\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nLet us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

And if you step into a particularly warm building or you're just running a little hot, you can simply remove the sweater for easy climatization.\n\nCardigans have also been on stylist trend forecasting, so having one is trendy as well as functional. But you don't have to pay runway prices to take advantage of this useful and stylish wardrobe staple. These options at Amazon are all under $30.\n\nBest Lightweight Cardigans Under $30 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Essentials Lightweight Open-Front Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nThis open-front cardigan hits around mid-thigh, comes in 20 different colors, and is available in sizes XS to 6X. With more than 16,000 five-star ratings, the airy cardigan has gained a lot of praise for its soft material and versatile shape. \"The fit is excellent, soft and draping,\" one buyer wrote in a review. \"I\u2019m really enjoying this sweater. I throw it on top of anything that I\u2019m wearing,\" added another.\n\nGrecerelle Scalloped Button-Down Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nThe scalloped edge design on this button-down cardigan gives it \"a more dressy look,\" according to a five-star customer review. It comes in 22 colors, including several striped options, in sizes small to XXL. The relaxed, slim fit makes it a perfect companion for jeans and trousers, but also dresses and skirts for more formal occasions. As another customer noted in their review, it would look cute on its own as a buttoned-up top, but it also works great as a layering piece. \"It\u2019s a lighter weight sweater but not too thin,\" they wrote.\n\nNewchoice Casual Soft Drape Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nThis casual cardigan is the perfect throw-and-go piece for errands or the office. It\u2019s made of a blend of viscose and spandex, so it\u2019s guaranteed to move with you without overheating. The cardigan comes in 35 colors, including several fun, bright shades as well as more classic, neutral options. It's also available in plus sizes up to a 3X. With more than 10,000 five-star ratings, this drapey cardigan is lauded for its \"soft material\" and \"perfect for layering\" structure. Another buyer added, \"I grab it to take everywhere \u2026 perfect cover up for these places that have AC on blasting even when it\u2019s cool outside.\"\n\nNinfort Lightweight Netted Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nThis cardigan's open-weave knit (which comes in eight colors) makes it a great layering piece. It's ideal for when the daytime weather may be on the warmer side, but you still want to be prepared for a chilly night or cold building temperature.\n\nThe cardigan comes in sizes small to XXL and has over 2,000 five-star ratings, with several customers praising its soft, lightweight material. One customer said it was one of their favorite sweaters that they could \"pair with almost anything.\" And another raved about the great fit and overall comfortability, adding, \"I love it with a dress. I love it with jeans. It\u2019s perfect!\"\n\nAmazon Essentials Lightweight Crewneck Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nIf you're looking for your classic cardigan silhouette, this is it. The crewneck button-up sweater has ribbed detailing at the cuffs and hem, and hits about mid-hip. You can get it in 26 colors from sizes XS to 6X. Customers raved about the \"comfortable and soft material\" and how useful it was in their wardrobes. \"It gives some additional warmth with little bulk,\" one reviewer wrote.\n\nHeading into spring, the weather will probably continue to be unreliable. But at least you can rely on the layering ability of a good lightweight cardigan like these at Amazon. And since they're all under $30, you can even pick up a couple to mix and match with different outfits and styles.\n\nLatahuo Striped Button-Down Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nPink Queen Colorblock Oversized Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nGrace Karin Essential Open-Front Maxi Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nFloerns Tie-Front Cropped Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nUrban CoCo Crewneck Cropped Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nLillusory Oversized Button-Down Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nOuges Open-Front Cardigan With Pockets\n\nAmazon\n\nBettysays 3/4 Sleeve Open-Front Cardigan\n\nAmazon\n\nDokotoo Checkered Button-Down Cropped Cardigan",

            "content": "On this day, 14 years ago, we launched Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), a highly scalable email sending service that allow businesses and developers to reliably and cost-effectively deliver email from the cloud without having to manage the underlying infrastructure and other operational complexities.\n\nFast forward to 2025: Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) processes over a trillion email each year for customers worldwide across various industries, from small startups to large enterprises for their transactional and marketing email workloads, including the emails for Amazon retail\u2019s Prime Day events. Today, we take the celebration of SES\u2019s 14th birthday to introduce some of the recently launched features and enhancements to SES features.\n\nEmail is a critical communication channel for businesses. With email marketing potentially delivering a $42 ROI for every dollar spent, businesses are eager to send and ensure their emails land in the inbox (called as deliverability). However, Email Service Providers (ESPs) have become more vigilant, implementing advanced filters to block unwanted or suspicious messages. ESPs now require long-standing best practices and bulk-sender requirements that all email senders must adhere to in order to achieve good deliverability and reputation with mailbox providers. Our reputation management systems analyze millions of data points daily (such as IPs, domains, bounces, complaints, and delivery notifications) to help your emails reach their intended inboxes.\n\nSES started as a simple email sending service and as the years passed (since 2011), we became increasingly passionate about email and our vision grew more exciting and innovative. Today, we are not only sending emails; we expanded into email relay and infrastructure features like Mail Manager, we added a secure, managed business email and calendar solution (Amazon WorkMail) to the SES portfolio and released features that help you analyze, monitor and optimize your email deliverability such as Virtual Deliverability Manager (VDM), and introduced Managed Dedicated IP (M-DIP) to help manage and improve your sender reputation. We\u2019ll explore each of these features in more detail later in the post. Industry leaders like Spamhaus recognize SES\u2019s four pillar framework of Prevention, Monitoring, Analysis and Response efforts and effectiveness in maintaining high email deliverability and reputation standards. You can read more about the framework on the official Spamhaus blog post here.\n\nEnsuring Email Resilience & Reliability with Global Endpoints:\n\nAn email that is not delivered or an email that is delivered late could be a lost opportunity. Therefore, ensuring your email messages keep flowing is important. Global Endpoints (launched in Dec 2024) is a feature for resilient sending through two commercial AWS Regions. Global Endpoints allows customers to choose a primary and secondary region which accommodate email sending workloads in an equal split under normal circumstances. If either region suffers an impairment, traffic shifts away from the affected Region towards the other, ensuring that email sending continues.\n\nUnlike manual multi-region setups, Global Endpoints synchronizes critical parameters between your two chosen Regions, and highlights remaining differences you must resolve. Once active, the load-balanced sending ensures both Regions have warmed-up IP addresses ready for your workloads, and no manual effort is required to respond to outages.\n\nYou can learn more about Global Endpoints by reading this blog here.\n\nModernizing Email Infrastructure with Amazon SES Mail Manager:\n\nMail Manager (launched in May 2024) is a set of Amazon SES email relay and gateway features designed to help you with governance, risk management, and compliance goals around all your corporate email workloads. At its core, Mail Manager acts as a routing and delivery relay, effectively managing email traffic and ensuring compliance. It\u2019s like having a digital traffic controller for your emails, efficiently processing rules while seamlessly integrating with your existing email infrastructure whether they are self-hosted or already at AWS. Mail Manager permits standard inspection and enforcement of routing, tracking, archiving, security and compliance rules whether messages are incoming, outgoing, or internal-to-internal. Mail Manager allows simple, cost-effective, and usage-based monitoring and enforcement of corporate policies while creating an easy migration path for application modernization and the wind-down of shadow IT mail servers throughout your organization.\n\nRecently, we announced full lifecycle logging, which means customers have the ability to configure end to end logging for ingress endpoints and rules engine actions to various destinations such as CloudWatch, S3, and Firehose. Organizations can also deliver emails to Q Business for indexing and queries and get a complete visibility into their email communications, enhancing transparency and security. With Mail Manager, you can also setup email journaling, prevent attacks such as email echo spoofing and modernize your email sending by connecting with advanced security solutions like Proofpoint.\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about Mail Manager in this blog post.\n\nEngagement, Deliverability and Maximizing Email Success with Virtual Deliverability Manager (VDM):\n\nEmail deliverability is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Businesses need tools to monitor and optimize their email delivery success rates to make every email count. Virtual Deliverability Manager (VDM) (launched in Sep 2022), is an Amazon SES feature that helps you enhance email deliverability, like increasing inbox deliverability and email conversions, by providing insights into your sending and delivery data, and giving advice on how to fix the issues that are negatively affecting your delivery success rate and reputation. Recently, we enhanced VDM with an adaptive setup, added complaint rate and delivery improvement recommendations.\n\nVDM tracks every email\u2019s journey, uncovering opportunities to improve delivery and engagement rates. Customers can dig deep into deliverability metrics such as bounce, complaint, open, click-through, and successful delivery rates in their accounts at multiple levels such as by sending email address, by email provider, or by SES configuration set. This makes it easy to quickly check the status and trend of sending health.\n\nVDM also analyzes sending configurations and provides automatic recommendations about how to increase sending success. This helps customers make changes such as DKIM configuration (Domain Keys Identified Mail) to increase the likelihood of successful delivery.\n\nAdvanced features like BIMI gap detection ensure your emails aren\u2019t just sent, but strategically positioned for maximum impact. The automated complaint rate insights act as an early warning system, helping businesses proactively protect their sender reputation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more, you can check out the blog posts by my colleagues Samuel Koppes (post) and Vinay Ujjini (post).\n\nReputation Management with Dedicated IPs (managed):\n\nWhen customers sign up for Amazon SES, their email sending is automatically handled through shared IP addresses. While this shared IP approach is cost-effective and safe, it also means customers don\u2019t have full control over their own sending reputation. The reputation of the IP they send from is determined by the quality and engagement levels of all emails sent from that IP. Some organizations can achieve exceptionally high reputation, and have turned to leasing dedicated IP addresses, where they are the sole sender on that IP. This helps them grow and maintain a positive sending reputation, building trust with ISPs and mailbox providers. Customers estimate how many dedicated IPs they need and request them before use. Dedicated IPs also require a careful \u201cwarm-up\u201d process, where senders gradually increase their email volume to avoid triggering spam filters.\n\nDedicated IPs (Managed) makes it easier to manage dedicated IPs, by automating process of provisioning, leasing, warming up, and managing dedicated IP addresses. Customers can create a managed dedicated IP pool through the API, CLI, or Console and start using it for dedicated sending without having to open support cases. The IP pool automatically scales in and out based on usage, taking into account the specific policies of each ISP. SES tracks the warmup level for each IP in the pool individually for each ISP, ensuring a gradual ramp-up of email volume. The warmup percentage calculation adapts to actual sending patterns, optimizing the warmup schedule. Excess sending is deferred and retried, with early-stage traffic leveraging the shared IP infrastructure.\n\nBy automating the management of dedicated IPs, Dedicated IPs (Managed) helps SES customers focus on their email content and strategy, while AWS handles the underlying infrastructure and reputation management. This allows senders to improve their deliverability and ensure more of their emails reach the intended inboxes.\n\nYou can learn more about dedicated IPs (managed) by reading the blog post here.\n\nElevating the Email Experience:\n\nUnderstanding the evolving needs of our customers, we\u2019ve released a number of new features to make email sending more seamless, secure, and transparent. SES now offers inline email templates that allow developers to seamlessly provide template content directly within their API requests, eliminating the process of managing template resources. We\u2019ve also enhanced tracking capabilities with HTTPS support for custom domains and introduced options to set maximum deliverability times for time-sensitive messages. Our AutoTag enhancements now include insights into TLS version for outgoing messages and customers now have the ability to set custom values in feedback headers, providing better transparency and control. In addition to these improvements, we\u2019ve also expanded Amazon SES to 24 regions, including AWS Govcloud (US-East).\n\nAs we celebrate Amazon SES\u2019s 14th birthday, we\u2019re not just looking back \u2013 we\u2019re looking forward. The future of email is here, and we\u2019re proud to be leading the way.\n\nThank you.\n\nGet started with Amazon SES",

            "content": "Amid all the drama surrounding TikTok, Amazon sneakily introduced a new way for users to save money: a mobile-only shopping experience where everything is under $20. You've probably heard about Amazon's secret premium outlet shop and their overstock section as ways to save money on the site, but takes budget-conscious shopping to another level.\n\nAmazon Haul is a new, mobile-only feature that highlights inexpensive products under $20, with most under $10. You can find just about everything you would on the normal Amazon site, from fashion to home decor, all at heavily discounted prices. Products are categorized similarly to the regular Amazon homepage, but the shopping experience is all-around a more user-friendly experience, with the interface feeding users' popular categories and highlighting clearance finds. However, you can easily get a more targeted shopping experience by using the search bar to see if Amazon Haul has exactly what you're looking for.\n\n\n\nHannah Jones for Country Living The Amazon Haul interface is punchy and easy to use, with curated categories meant to make shopping easier.\n\nSo, what allows Amazon to sell these products for so cheap? Shopping on Amazon Haul has quite a few more restrictions than the usual Amazon shopping experience. For starters, Amazon Haul doesn't work under the same model as Prime, which means free shipping is only available if you spend over $25. So, if you don't plan to bulk your purchases together on the site, then you may end up paying more overall including shipping than you would just going through the regular Amazon site. Additionally, two-day shipping has been nixed on this Amazon site, with \"typical delivery times of one to two weeks,\" according to a . Any returns must be made within 15 days of delivery, a much shorter window of time than usual for Amazon purchases, and the purchase value must be higher than $3. Finally, Amazon Haul rewards customers for buying more, giving discounts like 5% off when you spend $50 and 10% off orders of $75 or more. This ensures that customers are buying enough product to make the whole experience economically valuable on Amazon's end.\n\nAmazon Haul is a mobile-only experience, meaning you can only access it via the app on your phone (you can to take you straight to the site or just search \"haul\" in your Amazon app). It's also important to note that the site is still in the beta stage, so changes can be expected over the coming months. \"Amazon Haul is now rolling out in beta and available to U.S. customers when they next update their Amazon Shopping app,\" according to the press release.\n\nWhile I wouldn't recommend using Amazon Haul for any random impulse buy (due to the minimum purchase free shipping requirement), it can easily save you quite a bit of money when buying in bulk. Whether snagging everything you need for a Valentine's Day basket for your sweetie for $25 or stocking up on toiletries like razors or loofahs starting at just $2.99, you'll be amazed at just how much you realize you can add to your cart before hitting $25!",

Amazon challenged the union formation but lost the labor tribunal in October 2024.\n\nGlobal News reported that New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh said of the closures: \u201cWhat is happening in Quebec is very clearly Amazon trying to union-bust. These are workers that were trying to unionize, and Amazon is shutting down operations in the complete region, just to stop them from demanding fairness.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Barbara Agrait, has denied that the decision was related.\n\nCanadian government customers of AWS include the border services, Health Canada, the government of Ontario, Library and Archives Canada, BC Hydro, and the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, among others.

Credit: Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz\n\nComplex organisms, thousands of times smaller than a grain of sand, can shape massive ecosystems and influence the fate of Earth's climate, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers from Arizona State University, along with their colleagues from the National University of the Peruvian Amazon, have identified an unknown family of microbes uniquely adapted to the waterlogged, low-oxygen conditions of tropical peatlands in Peru's northwestern Amazonian rainforest.\n\nThe new research shows these microbes have a dual role in the carbon cycle and the potential to either moderate or intensify climate change. This process can either stabilize carbon for long-term storage or release it into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2 and methane.\n\nUnder stable conditions, these microbes enable peatlands to act as vast carbon reservoirs, sequestering carbon and reducing climate risks. However, environmental shifts, including drought and warming, can trigger their activity, accelerating global climate change.\n\nAnd, continued human-caused disruption of the natural peatland ecosystem could release 500 million tons of carbon by the end of the century\u2014roughly equivalent to 5% of the world's annual fossil fuel emissions.\n\n\"The microbial universe of the Amazon peatlands is vast in space and time, has been hidden by their remote locations, and has been severely under-studied in their local and global contributions, but thanks to local partnerships, we can now visit and study these key ecosystems,\" says Hinsby Cadillo Quiroz, corresponding author of the new study and a researcher with the Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology at ASU.\n\n\"Our work is finding incredible organisms adapted to this environment, and several of them provide unique and important services\u2014from carbon stabilization or recycling to carbon monoxide detoxification and others.\"\n\nCadillo-Quiroz is also a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics and the ASU School of Life Sciences. ASU colleague Michael J. Pavia is the lead author of the investigation.\n\nThe study, appearing in the American Society for Microbiology journal Microbiology Spectrum, emphasizes the importance of protecting tropical peatlands to stabilize one of the planet's most significant carbon storage systems and underscores the subtle interplay between microbial life and global climate regulation.\n\nLocal residents in the dense Amazon rainforest, near the Pastaza-Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Foreland Basin. Their deep connection to the land offers valuable insights for researchers like Hinsby, whose work depends on understanding both the ecosystem and the communities living within it. Credit: Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz\n\nWhy peatlands are crucial for climate stability\n\nThe Amazonian peatlands are among the planet's largest carbon vaults, storing an estimated 3.1 billion tons of carbon in their dense, saturated soils\u2014roughly twice the carbon stored in all the world's forests. Peatlands are critical for global carbon storage because their waterlogged conditions slow decomposition, allowing organic material to accumulate over thousands of years. These ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions and influencing global climate patterns.\n\nBuilding on earlier research, the current study describes newly identified microbes\u2014part of the ancient Bathyarchaeia group that forms a complex network essential to the functioning of this ecosystem. The study highlights the remarkable abilities of these microorganisms to regulate carbon cycling in peatlands. Unlike most organisms, these microbes can thrive in extreme conditions, including environments with little to no oxygen, thanks to their metabolic flexibility.\n\nThe microbes are found in the Pastaza-Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Foreland Basin\u2014a vital peatland in the northwestern Amazon rainforest of Peru. Encompassing approximately 100,000 square kilometers, the basin includes vast tracts of flooded rainforest and swamps underlain by ancient peat.\n\nThese peatland microbes consume carbon monoxide\u2014metabolizing a gas toxic to many organisms\u2014and convert it into energy, simultaneously reducing carbon toxicity in the environment. By breaking down carbon compounds, they produce hydrogen and CO 2 that other microbes use to generate methane. Their ability to survive both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions makes them well suited to Amazonian environments, where water levels and oxygen availability fluctuate throughout the year.\n\nHowever, shifts in rainfall, temperature and human activities, including deforestation and mining, are disrupting this delicate balance, causing peatlands to release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns could dry out these peatlands, turning them into carbon sources.\n\nStudy author Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz collects soil samples in the lush rainforest of the Pastaza-Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Foreland Basin. Fieldwork like this is vital for understanding the complex ecosystems of the Amazon and their role in global environmental processes. Credit: Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz\n\nThe release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane from peatlands would significantly amplify global warming. The findings emphasize the urgent need to protect tropical peatlands from human activities and climate-induced stress.\n\nThe researchers advocate for sustainable land management, including reducing deforestation, drainage and mining activities in peatlands to prevent disruptions. Further investigation of microbial communities is needed to better understand their roles in carbon and nutrient cycling.\n\nTracking changes in temperature, rainfall and ecosystem dynamics is also necessary to predict future impacts on peatlands.\n\nNew directions\n\nThe discovery of highly adaptable peatland microbes advances our understanding of microbial diversity and underscores the resilience of life in extreme environments. These microbes represent a key piece of the puzzle in addressing global climate challenges, showing how the tiniest organisms can have an outsized impact on Earth's systems.\n\nThis research, supported by the National Science Foundation, marks a significant step forward in understanding the critical role of tropical peatlands and their microbial inhabitants in global carbon cycling. As climate change continues to reshape our planet, these hidden ecosystems hold lessons that may help safeguard our future.\n\nCadillo-Quiroz and his team plan to use this microbial and ecological knowledge for tropical peatlands management and restoration in their future work, which can be followed here.\n\n\"Working to understand microbes and ecosystems in the lush and magnificent Amazon rainforest is the honor of my life, which I aim to use in the protection of this region in the fight against climate change,\" Cadillo-Quiroz says.\n\nMore information: Michael J.

            "content": "Would it surprise you to hear that 60% of Amazon's (AMZN -2.83%) total operating income came from Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone over the past 12 months? It's true! While some still consider Amazon an online retailer, AWS is the company's best moneymaker. This is even more important given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRather than use thousands of words, below are three charts that show why Amazon is one of the best AI stocks to own today.\n\n1. Data centers\n\nAI is a boon for efficiency and has the potential to wildly increase productivity over time. However, the technology brings its own set of challenges. As shown below, managing and processing the vast amount of required data is the largest one:\n\nThis is where Amazon comes in. The company is the world's leading provider of cloud data services and intends to stay there. Amazon plans to invest around $100 billion in over 200 data centers worldwide in the next decade. This will ensure that AWS has the capacity to continue as the global leader.\n\nAWS functions much like a utility, where customers pay for the data they use. This is a tremendous business model in a world where data needs are constantly growing. The segment grew 19% in Q3 2024 to $27.5 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, it also surpassed $100 billion in sales and $36 billion in operating income. With AI demand and expanded capacity, AWS will continue to power profits for a long time to come.\n\n2. Cash flow\n\nAmazon was a major beneficiary when the stimulus flowed in 2020 and 2021. People were spending, interest rates were near zero, and Amazon's operating cash flow soared to record highs. Operating cash flow is essentially the amount of money a company's primary business generates, making it a terrific metric to judge success.\n\nIn Amazon's case, it is the cash created from product sales, advertising sales, third-party seller services, and AWS. While the stimulus years were excellent, Amazon's recent operating cash flow has ,exploded much, much higher:\n\nThe $113 billion generated over the past 12 months is by far an all-time high, dwarfing the 2020-2021 boom. Much of this is the result of surging sales in AWS. Due to AI-driven demand, cash flow should continue to reach new heights, allowing Amazon to invest heavily in growth and sustain its lead in the cloud.\n\n3. Valuation\n\nThe S&P 500 index hit a new all-time high over 50 times in 2024, and many companies' valuations are very high. However, Amazon's stock price is still reasonable. Based on the abovementioned cash flow and earnings, it trades below five-year historical averages, as shown below.\n\nAmazon's price-to-earnings ratio drops to just 37 based on next year's estimates, which may still sound high but is quite low historically for the company. Despite the market's rapid rise, Amazon is still a great value for long-term investors.\n\nThere are dozens of quality AI stocks to consider, and I recommend owning at least a few. Given the intense demand for data, Amazon's prolific cash-flow generation, and a reasonable valuation, Amazon stock is an excellent choice for long-term investment.",

Sure, it can play your favorite New Year's Eve hype song on Spotify or get you the weather forecast for Valentine's Day, but that's just the beginning. You can also use simple voice commands to control your Fire TV devices, set up daily routines and make your smart home even smarter.\n\nWant to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try.\n\nNewest Amazon Alexa commands\n\nAlexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the \"Let's chat\" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out.\n\nWatch this: Amazon's Alexa Gets More Conversational With AI 03:55\n\nPrior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including:\n\nThe \"Hey, Disney\" command, which allows you to get information and play around with some of Disney's most beloved characters Disney's Magic Band Plus to play game-show style trivia games and more.\n\ncommand, which allows you to get information and play around with some of Disney's Magic Band Plus to play game-show style trivia games and more.

The 3rd-gen Fire TV Cube \"Alexa, watch ESPN on cable\" so that you don't have to manually change inputs on your TV, and if you have a compatible webcam that you can connect into the Fire TV Cube, you can say something like \"Alexa, call dad\" to video call friends and family on your TV.\n\nso that you don't have to manually change inputs on your TV, and if you have a compatible webcam that you can connect into the Fire TV Cube, you can say something like to video call friends and family on your TV. Amazon also announced the second-generation Amazon Echo Auto, which drivers can use to play music, make calls and even talk with an agent to request help by saying, \"Hey Alexa, call roadside assistance.\"\n\nIf you're into shopping, you can say something like \"Alexa, show me the green-pleated skirt\" to find specific clothing items using the Shop the Look feature, which you can also use for home and beauty products.\n\nto find specific clothing items using the Shop the Look feature, which you can also use for home and beauty products. Using Amazon to make purchases from Whole Foods for curbside pickup? You can say \"Alexa, check into Whole Foods\" to let the grocery store know you're there.\n\nto let the grocery store know you're there. And if you want to turn on a light or some other smart home device, you can now schedule it. For example, you can say \"Hey Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights in 5 minutes.\"\n\nSummoning Alexa\n\nBy default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, \"Alexa.\" You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually).\n\nIf you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa.\n\nThere's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, \"Stop.\"\n\nAmazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, \"Alexa, play folk music at volume six,\" or, \"Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list.\"\n\nYour Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. Amazon\n\nOther places you can access Alexa\n\nWhile the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant.\n\nIn fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have:\n\nThe Alexa app on iOS Android\n\nThe Amazon Shopping app\n\nThe Amazon Music app\n\nCortana on a Windows computer\n\nYou can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. \"Hey, Siri\" or \"Hey, Google\" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant.\n\nOn an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, \"Open Alexa.\" After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana.\n\nAlexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example).\n\nThe complete list of Alexa commands\n\nThe list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted.\n\nWhen you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com.\n\nHere are all the native Alexa commands.\n\nBasic Alexa commands\n\nAsk for help: \"Alexa, help.\"\n\nMute or unmute: \"Alexa, mute\" or, \"Alexa, unmute.\"\n\nStop or pause: \"Alexa, stop\" or, \"Alexa, shut up.\"\n\nChange volume: \"Alexa, set the volume to 5,\" \"Alexa, louder\" or, \"Alexa, turn up/down the volume.\"\n\nAlexa commands for Echo Show\n\nThe Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things.\n\nAsk for what the Echo Show can display: \"Alexa, what can you show me?\"\n\nShow your calendar: \"Alexa, show my calendar.\"\n\nShow pictures: \"Alexa, show my photos\" or, \"Alexa, show me pictures of cats.\"\n\nView your cameras or other rooms: \"Alexa, show the living room camera.\"\n\n\n\nView movie trailers: \"Alexa, show me the trailer for Wakanda Forever\n\nMovie showtimes: \"Alexa, show me movie showtimes.\"\n\nView the forecast: \"Alexa, show me the weekend forecast.\"\n\nPlay YouTube videos: \"Alexa, show me travel videos on YouTube.\"\n\nDisplay recipes: \"Alexa, show me a slow cooker recipe from Allrecipes.\"\n\nView your Flash Briefing: \"Alexa, play my video Flash Briefing.\"\n\nSee your timers: \"Alexa, show me my timers.\"\n\nOpen a visual skill: \"Alexa, open Uber.\"\n\nYou can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. Chris Monroe/CNET\n\nAlexa commands for Fire TV and Fire TV Stick\n\nYou can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks.\n\nControl Fire TV: \"Alexa, [pause, play, resume, stop, fast-forward, rewind] on Fire TV.\"\n\nSearch movies or TV: \"Alexa, search for [movie to TV show title] on Fire TV\" or, \"Alexa, find [movie or TV show title] on Fire TV.\"\n\nFind work by a certain actor: \"Alexa, show me titles with [actor] on Fire TV.\"\n\nOpen apps: \"Alexa, open [app name] on Fire TV\" or, \"Alexa, launch [app name] on Fire TV.\"\n\nReturn home: \"Alexa, return home.\"\n\nAlexa commands for Fire TV Edition televisions\n\nAmazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series.

Both include a 175GB root volume and 100GB for user file storage.\n\nHP Elite 600 G9 Tower Desktop PC: was $1,099.99 now $999.99 at Amazon Workstations need not be expensive or bulky. The Elite 600 G9 for example costs only $999.99 has a 16-core CPU and 64GB of RAM. Unlike AWS's off-prem solutions, this one comes with Windows 11 Pro and 2TB SSD and is one you can keep forever.\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre M70q: $1,039 at Amazon The Lenovo ThinkCentre M70q mini workstation is even smaller and more powerful than the Elite 600 G9. It features a more recent Intel CPU and is more than a match for AWS's GeneralPurpose.4xlarge.\n\nWindows-only\n\nAmazon is positioning the two new offerings as being ideal for developers, scientists, financial analysts, and engineers who need to run demanding applications.\n\n\u201cDevelopers can handle large compilation and development tasks with tools like Visual Studio, IntelliJ, and Eclipse, while engineers and scientists can run complex simulations with MatLab, GNU Octave, R, and Stata,\u201d the company says.\n\nThe GeneralPurpose.8xlarge instance is AWS\u2019s first to offer 32 vCPUs but it\u2019s not cheap. With Windows licensing, the 32 vCPU version costs $590 per month, while the 16 vCPU model is priced at $295 monthly. Hourly rates of $4.56 and $2.28 are also available for an additional $19 monthly fee.\n\nThree\u2019s no mention of pricing for Linux users, so it looks as if this is a Windows-only offering for now. Users with their own Windows licenses (BYOL) can save a small amount \u2013 the 32 vCPU version drops to $544 ($4.40 an hour) while the 16 vCPU model is $272 ($2.20 an hour).\n\nAre you a pro?

Additionally, users will obviously still require a separate device to access these cloud desktops.\n\nIn parallel to this announcement, AWS also introduced updates to its EC2 Image Builder, allowing Microsoft Windows ISO files to be directly converted into Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), simplifying the process of using existing Windows licenses with Amazon WorkSpaces.",

            "content": "The healthcare industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and connected care devices. This digital revolution promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the overall healthcare experience. However, it also introduces new challenges in terms of cybersecurity, privacy, and regulatory compliance. To navigate this complex landscape, healthcare organizations are turning to scalable, affordable, and highly available cloud infrastructures such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build resilient, secure, and innovative solutions.\n\nThe integrated healthcare services ecosystem\n\nToday\u2019s healthcare landscape is evolving into an integrated ecosystem that connects traditional providers, health plans, pharmacies, and brick-and-mortar care organizations with cloud service providers, digital marketplaces, and connected medical devices. This ecosystem is data-driven and creates the foundation for innovative generative AI applications in health and life sciences.\n\nThe following diagram shows the modern integrated healthcare and life sciences services ecosystem, which is a network of traditional providers, health plans, pharmacies, and other brick-and-mortar care organizations coupled with cloud service providers and new digital marketplaces, connected medical devices, and of course the healthcare consumer. This ecosystem must be data-driven and, in turn, creates the data that can power innovative and modern generative AI applications for health and life sciences.\n\nAs Liz Popwell, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer at Stony Brook Medicine, noted in 2023, \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped calling ourselves a health system and started calling ourselves a health platform because we\u2019ve got to have partnerships to make this happen.\u201d These platforms and partnerships are crucial for using data and technology to transform healthcare and drive the Quadruple Aim objectives: improving patient experience, improving population health, reducing care costs, and enhancing caregiver experiences. The health platform is the modern integrated, data-driven ecosystem that fuels innovation.\n\nNavigating the security challenges of generative AI\n\nWhile generative AI holds immense potential for revolutionizing healthcare and life sciences, from research and population health to clinical decision support, patient care, and drug development, it also brings unique security and privacy concerns. These challenges include governance, data management, data loss protection, legal and regulatory compliance, and the potential for shadow AI use and bias.\n\nTo address these challenges, healthcare organizations must start by adopting a defense-in-depth strategy, using the layered security services offered by AWS and its partners. This multilayered approach uses AWS services and solutions to enhance overall security and resilience and better protect generative AI environments and workloads. As explained in Architect defense-in-depth security for generative AI application using the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs in the AWS Machine Learning Blog, defense-in-depth security best practices can mitigate many of the common risks that any workload faces, helping accelerate generative AI innovation. The AWS Machine Learning Blog post recommends following the defense-in-depth model to help address and mitigate the common security concerns and risks that can undermine trust in AI, as identified by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 for LLM Applications. The following graphic shows the seven layers that make up the defense-in-depth approach:\n\nPolicies, procedures, and awareness\n\nNetwork and edge protection\n\nIdentity and access management\n\nThreat detection and incident response\n\nInfrastructure protection\n\nApplication protection\n\nData protection\n\nEmbracing a resilience-first approach\n\nHealthcare organizations need to go beyond traditional cybersecurity measures and adopt a resilience-first approach. This means being prepared to quickly protect, detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents rather than solely focusing on prevention. In fact, OWASP\u2019s 2024 publication LLM AI Cybersecurity & Governance Checklist lists a resilience-first strategy as step one for LLM deployment. AWS supports this holistic view of resilience through its shared responsibility model and resilience lifecycle framework, which includes setting objectives, designing and implementing solutions, evaluating and testing, ongoing operation, and responding and learning.\n\nSecuring connected care devices and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)\n\nIn addition to the exponential growth of generative AI, the proliferation of connected care devices and IoMT has introduced new cybersecurity challenges. These challenges must also be addressed because both the operational and clinical data from these devices will be integrated into LLMs to drive clinical and operational innovation and insights. AWS is focused on helping organizations establish an end-to-end secure chain of custody to protect cloud-connected medical devices. It\u2019s not just about protecting the physical device but about protecting identities, data, networks, and apps while also complying with regulatory requirements and privacy mandates. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of solutions to help healthcare organizations build a robust foundation of security, privacy, and compliance in this connected care era, including:\n\nWhy choose AWS for healthcare\n\nAWS has established itself as the premier cloud platform for healthcare, offering:\n\nBy using AWS, healthcare organizations can unlock the full potential of cloud computing while providing the security, compliance, and resilience needed to deliver exceptional patient care. With the AWS comprehensive toolset, healthcare leaders can transform their operations, drive innovation, and stay ahead in an ever-changing industry.\n\nAs the healthcare sector continues to embrace digital transformation, partnering with AWS provides the necessary tools and expertise to navigate the complex landscape of cybersecurity and resilience. By adopting AWS solutions and implementing a resilience-first strategy, healthcare organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture, protect patient data, and provide the continuity of critical healthcare services in an increasingly connected world.\n\nTo schedule an in-depth security briefing or security and resilience workshop, reach out to your account team or visit our booth, No. 4624, at the HIMSS Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, March 3\u20136, 2025 or attend our Security and Resilience workshop in March.",

This includes both its own products and ones sold by third-party sellers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant because of the ruling. And it\u2019s ultra-significant because it\u2019s Amazon,\u201d attorney Don Fountain said to CBS News. \u201c[It] may not sound like much to the average person, but from a legal standpoint, that creates a huge duty on Amazon to be aware of and monitor and provide notice of safety defects and recalls to the consumer.\u201d\n\nThose who purchased a recalled or defective item will be notified by email and the information about the recall will be posted to each buyer\u2019s orders page, according to WKRC.\n\nThe company will issue full refunds for anyone who can provide proof of destruction or disposal of recalled items. It will also keep recall notices on its website for a period of five years.\n\nAmazon is also expected to submit monthly progress reports to the CPSC for five years.",

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) took aim at Walmart (WMT) more than two decades ago with Jeff Bezos' vision: transforming the online bookseller into a globe-spanning \"everything store.\" Coming off a big year for the tech giant and Amazon stock, 2025 could be the year Amazon supplants Walmart for the title of world's largest company by revenue.\n\nIt's a complicated battle since the companies aren't perfectly comparable. Amazon has a fast-growing cloud computing arm while Walmart has the world's largest footprint of physical stores. Still, Walmart has topped lists of largest companies by revenue, such as the Fortune 500, every year since 2014. But Amazon has been catching up to the retail behemoth. Analysts project the two firms will finish neck-and-neck for 2025.\n\nStill, that doesn't mean Amazon is on its way to vanquishing Walmart as a threat. In fact, Walmart stock outperformed Amazon's last year. Even as new challengers like Temu are capturing attention, analysts say Walmart is stepping up its challenge to Amazon's e-commerce dominance.\n\n\"Walmart is significantly growing their e-commerce business while they're also significantly investing in their e-commerce business,\" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram, who covers both Amazon and Walmart, told Investor's Business Daily. \"Really, Walmart over the last several years has been able to copy from Amazon's playbook.\"\n\nAmazon Stock: Revenue Battle Vs. Walmart\n\nWalmart will likely keep the crown for largest company by revenue for 2024. For Walmart's January-ending fiscal year, analysts polled by FactSet project that Walmart's sales will grow 5% to $680 billion. Amazon's sales for its December-ended fiscal year are projected to grow 11% to $637.9 billion.\n\nWalmart still sells significantly more goods than Amazon. The National Retail Federation Top 100 retailers list estimates that Walmart accounts for $635 billion in global retail sales compared to Amazon's $360 billion as of 2023, the most recent data.\n\nOf course, Amazon has another $100 billion annual business in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services, along with a fast-growing digital advertising business that has emerged as a rival to giants like Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META)\n\nThat's why the revenue winner for 2025 looks like a toss-up, based on analyst projections. Walmart is projected for $708.8 billion in revenue for the 12 months ended January 2026, according to FactSet, compared to Amazon's $707 billion projected sales for calendar year 2025.\n\nAmazon could soon surpass Walmart on a quarterly basis for the first time. Amazon's projected $187.3 billion in December quarter revenue could come in ahead of Walmart $179.8 billion in projected sales for its January-ending Q4.\n\nWhat Revenue Crown Means For Amazon Stock\n\nIn fact, it may be a matter of when, not if, Amazon surpasses Walmart, Sundaram said. But Amazon stock is unlikely to move significantly based on whether it surpasses Walmart for total revenue.\n\n\"For Amazon, yeah the retail business is important, e-commerce is their main source of revenue,\" Sundaram told IBD. \"But the main source of their profits is their AWS business. And investors really pay more attention to AWS.\"\n\nStill, the battle is drawing attention as Walmart has upped its challenge to Amazon's e-commerce dominance. Walmart's annual global e-commerce sales surpassed $100 billion in 2023 and are growing fast. E-commerce revenue grew 28% year over year for Walmart's most recent October-ended third quarter. However, e-commerce is still not a profitable business for Walmart.\n\nAmazon captured 42% of U.S. e-commerce spending in 2024 compared to Walmart's 9.6%, according to estimates from BofA Global Research. But Walmart e-commerce market share increased by 1.2% from a year earlier, faster than Amazon's 0.8% increase in market share.\n\nAmazon Stock 45% Gain Vs Walmart 72% Gain\n\nWalmart shares gained 72% in 2024, ranking 20th among top-performers in the S&P 500. Amazon stock gained 45%. Amazon has a market cap above $2 trillion, compared to roughly $760 billion for Walmart.\n\nWalmart refocused its e-commerce business over several years by expanding its third-party seller marketplace and selling advertising on its platform. The company also launched its answer to the $139-per-year Amazon Prime membership in 2020, called Walmart+. For $98 per year, the membership include free delivery from local Walmart locations, free shipping on other items and other benefits.\n\nRick Watson, chief executive of RMW Commerce Consulting, said Amazon's Prime subscription provides the company with \"one of the most defensible moats in North America.\"\n\nAn estimated 194 million Americans had an Amazon Prime membership as of December, according to estimates by the research firm CIRP.\n\nWalmart+, meanwhile, is believed by analysts to be far smaller.\n\nBut Walmart has made the right moves to make its subscription offering more compelling, Watson said, including by expanding online inventory through third-party sellers.\n\n\"Amazon is still the king,\" Watson told IBD. \"Walmart, it seems, has found a good formula with the same-day services combined with grocery and increasing selection online. So they're on a really good growth trajectory.\"\n\nOther retailers, such as Target (TGT), are still looking for the right loyalty formula in membership offerings, Watson added.\n\nAmazon Is Retail Advertising King\n\nA key part of Amazon's recent growth and improved retail margins is its advertising business. Amazon is projected to bring in $56.3 billion in advertising revenue for 2024, according to FactSet.\n\nThe tech giant pioneered and dominates the retail media search advertising category. Research firm eMarketer projects that 80% of retail media search revenue went to Amazon last year.\n\nBut Walmart's efforts are growing quickly. eMarketer forecast in June that Walmart would account for 40% of \"non-Amazon retail media search ad dollars\" in 2024 \u2014 top among all competitors. Bernstein analysts believe Walmart has room to grow its ad revenue.\n\n\"Compared to Amazon's ad revenue at (more than) 7% of gross merchandise value, Walmart's U.S. ad revenue is only at a low-single-digital percentage of GMV today,\" wrote Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma in a recent client note. \"We believe that Walmart can play catch-up by growing its marketplace, but likely won't achieve Amazon's level as Walmart strikes a balance between maintaining its e-grocery stronghold and growing the more profitable third-party business.\"\n\nWalmart's Advantage Over Amazon?\n\nThere is one e-commerce sector where Walmart is the clear leader: groceries. Even with its purchase of Whole Foods eight years ago, Amazon has struggled to match Walmart's scale for food and other essentials.\n\nWalmart captured the highest percentage of U.S. online grocery sales in 2024 at 27%, according to eMarketer projections. Amazon is projected at 18.5% of sales, by the same projections.\n\nAmazon is adjusting its strategy. Last year, it launched a new grocery subscription option and took efforts to streamline the supply chain and customer interface for its Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and third-party grocer offerings.\n\nIn a letter to shareholder last year, Chief Executive Andy Jassy highlighted grocery alongside generative AI, Prime Video and health care as potential growth areas for Amazon.\n\nThere are reasons it remains a priority.\n\n\"If you can attract a customer to come into your website or your store to buy groceries, it's so much easier to sell them other things, whether a T-shirt, furniture, whatever it is,\" Sundaram told IBD. \"That's what Amazon really wanted to do by getting more competitive in the grocery space. But they've struggled. \"\n\nThat means, in this case, Amazon is still hoping to be the disrupter. Sundaram said he expects Amazon will pursue more \"investment in that area, to try to better compete with the giants like Walmart.\"\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

Its unified data architecture supports data analysis, business intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI applications, which can now take advantage of a single authoritative copy of data. With SageMaker Lakehouse, you get the best of both worlds\u2014the flexibility to use cost effective Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage with the scalable compute of a data lake, along with the performance, reliability and SQL capabilities typically associated with a data warehouse.\n\nSageMaker Lakehouse enables interoperability by providing open source Apache Iceberg REST APIs to access data in the lakehouse. Customers can now use their choice of tools and a wide range of AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena and Amazon SageMaker, in addition to third-party analytics engines that are compatible with Apache Iceberg REST specifications to query their data in-place.\n\nFinally, SageMaker Lakehouse now provides secure and fine-grained access controls on data in both data warehouses and data lakes. With resource permission controls from AWS Lake Formation integrated into the AWS Glue Data Catalog, SageMaker Lakehouse lets customers securely define and share access to a single authoritative copy of data across their entire organization.\n\nOrganizations managing workloads in AWS analytics and Databricks can now use this open and secure lakehouse capability to unify policy administration and oversight of their data lake in Amazon S3. In this post, we will show you how Databricks on AWS general purpose compute can integrate with the AWS Glue Iceberg REST Catalog for metadata access and use Lake Formation for data access. To keep the setup in this post straightforward, the Glue Iceberg REST Catalog and Databricks cluster share the same AWS account.\n\nSolution overview\n\nIn this post, we show how tables cataloged in Data Catalog and stored in Amazon S3 general purpose buckets can be consumed from Databricks compute using Glue Iceberg REST Catalog with data access secured using Lake Formation. We will show you how the cluster can be configured to interact with Glue Iceberg REST Catalog, use a notebook to access the data using Lake Formation temporary vended credentials, and run analysis to derive insights. While this solution demonstrates the use of S3 general purpose buckets, you can create a similar setup on S3 Tables by modifying your application\u2019s configuration.\n\nThe following figure shows the architecture described in the preceding paragraph.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo follow along with the solution presented in this post, you need the following AWS prerequisites:\n\nAccess to the Lake Formation data lake administrator in your AWS account. A Lake Formation data lake administrator is an IAM principal that can register Amazon S3 locations, access the Data Catalog, grant Lake Formation permissions to other users, and view AWS CloudTrail See Create a data lake administrator for more information. Enable full table access for external engines to access data in Lake Formation. Sign into Lake Formation console as an IAM administrator and choose Administration in the navigation pane.\n\nin the navigation pane. Choose Application integration settings and select Allow external engines to access data in Amazon S3 locations with full table access .\n\nand select . Choose Save.\n\nAn existing AWS Glue database and tables. For this post, we will use an AWS Glue database named icebergdemodb , which contains an Iceberg table named person and data is stored in an S3 general purpose bucket named icebergdemodatalake .\n\n\n\nA user-defined IAM role that Lake Formation assumes when accessing the data in the above S3 location to vend scoped credentials. Follow the instructions provided in Requirements for roles used to register locations. For this post, we will use the IAM role LakeFormationRegistrationRole .\n\nIn addition to the AWS prerequisites, you need access to Databricks Workspace (on AWS) and the ability to create a cluster with No isolation shared access mode.\n\nSet up an instance profile role. For instructions on how to create and set up the role, see Manage instance profiles in Databricks. Create customer managed policy named: dataplane-glue-lf-policy with below policies and attach the same to the instance profile role:\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"glue:UpdateTable\", \"glue:GetDatabase\", \"glue:GetDatabases\", \"glue:GetCatalog\", \"glue:GetCatalogs\", \"glue:GetPartitions\", \"glue:GetPartition\", \"glue:GetTable\", \"glue:GetTables\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:glue:<aws_region>:<accountid>:table/icebergdemodb/*\", \"arn:aws:glue:<aws_region>:<accountid>:database/icebergdemodb\", \"arn:aws:glue:<aws_region>:<accountid>:catalog\" ] }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"lakeformation:GetDataAccess\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] }\n\nFor this post, we will use an instance profile role ( databricks-dataplane-instance-profile-role ), which will be attached to the previously created cluster.\n\nRegister the Amazon S3 location as the data lake location\n\nRegistering an Amazon S3 location with Lake Formation provides an IAM role with read/write permissions to the S3 location. In this case, you are required to register the icebergdemodatalake bucket location using the LakeFormationRegistrationRole IAM role.\n\nAfter the location is registered, Lake Formation assumes the LakeFormationRegistrationRole role when it grants temporary credentials to the integrated AWS services/third-party analytics engines that are compatible(prerequisite Step 2) that access data in that S3 bucket location.\n\nTo register the Amazon S3 location as the data lake location, complete the following steps:\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console for Lake Formation as the data lake administrator . In the navigation pane, choose Data lake locations under Administration. Choose Register location. For Amazon S3 path, enter s3://icebergdemodatalake . For IAM role, select LakeFormationRegistrationRole. For Permission mode, select Lake Formation. Choose Register location.\n\n\n\nGrant database and table permissions to the IAM role used within Databricks\n\nGrant DESCRIBE permission on the icebergdemodb database to the Databricks IAM instance role.\n\nSign in to the Lake Formation console as the data lake administrator. In the navigation pane, choose Data lake permissions and choose Grant. In the Principles section, select IAM users and roles and choose databricks-dataplane-instance-profile-role. In the LF-Tags or catalog resources section, select Named Data Catalog resources. Choose <accountid> for Catalogs and icebergdemodb for Databases. Select DESCRIBE for Database permissions. Choose Grant.\n\nGrant SELECT and DESCRIBE permissions on the person table in the icebergdemodb database to the Databricks IAM instance role.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Data lake permissions and choose Grant. In the Principles section, select IAM users and roles and choose databricks-dataplane-instance-profile-role. In the LF-Tags or catalog resources section, select Named Data Catalog resources. Choose <accountid> for Catalogs, icebergdemodb for Databases and person for table. Select SUPER for Table permissions. Choose Grant.\n\nGrant data location permissions on the bucket to the Databricks IAM instance role.\n\nIn the Lake Formation console navigation pane, choose Data Locations, and then choose Grant. For IAM users and roles, choose databricks-dataplane-instance-profile-role. For Storage locations, select the s3://icebergdemodatalake. Choose Grant.\n\nDatabricks workspace\n\nCreate a cluster and configure it to connect with a Glue Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint. For this post, we will use a Databricks cluster with runtime version 15.4 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.5.0, Scala 2.12).\n\nIn Databricks console, choose Compute in the navigation pane. Create a cluster with runtime version 15.4 LTS, access mode as \u2018No isolation shared\u2018 and choose databricks-dataplane-instance-profile-role as instance profile role under Configuration section.\n\nExpand the Advanced options section. In the Spark section, for Spark Config include the following details: spark.sql.extensions org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.type rest spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.uri https://glue.<aws region>.amazonaws.com/iceberg spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.warehouse <aws account number> spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.rest.sigv4-enabled true spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.rest.signing-name glue spark.sql.defaultCatalog spark_catalog In the Cluster section, for Libraries include the following jars: org.apache.iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.6.1 software.amazon.awssdk:bundle:2.29.5\n\nCreate a notebook for analyzing data managed in Data Catalog:\n\nIn the workspace browser, create a new notebook and attach it to the cluster created above. Run the following commands in the notebook cell to query the data. #Show Databases df= spark.sql(\u201cshow databases\u201d) display (df)\n\n\n\nFurther modify the data in the S3 data lake using the AWS Glue Iceberg REST Catalog.\n\n\n\nThis shows that you can now analyze data in a Databricks cluster using an AWS Glue Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint with Lake Formation managing the data access.\n\nClean up\n\nTo clean up the resources used in this post and avoid possible charges:\n\nDelete the cluster created in Databricks. Delete the IAM roles created for this post. Delete the resources created in Data Catalog. Empty and then delete the S3 bucket.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we have showed you how to manage a dataset centrally in AWS Glue Data Catalog and make it accessible to Databricks compute using the Iceberg REST Catalog API. The solution also enables you to use Databricks to use existing access control mechanisms with Lake Formation, which is used to manage metadata access and enable underlying Amazon S3 storage access using credential vending.\n\nTry the feature and share your feedback in the comments.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nSrividya Parthasarathy is a Senior Big Data Architect on the AWS Lake Formation team.

            "content": "An independent group of workers at an Amazon warehouse in Garner, North Carolina, are seeking to form the second unionized warehouse at Amazon in the US.\n\nCarolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment (Cause) filed to hold a union election at the warehouse, which, despite Amazon claiming they were \u201cvery skeptical\u201d the group would have enough legitimate signatures for the petition, was approved by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe election to represent 4,300 workers at the 700,000 sq foot warehouse in the suburbs of Raleigh is scheduled to be held from 10 to 15 February.\n\nThe union has been organizing since early 2022 at the warehouse, pushing for better pay, improved paid time off, better scheduling, improved accommodations for workers with injuries or disabilities, and respect on the job.\n\nThe Rev Ryan Brown, a co-founder of the group, who worked at the warehouse for five years until he was terminated in December, explained he was inspired by seeing Amazon workers such as Jennifer Bates publicly speak out during the first union election at Amazon in the US in 2021 at a Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse. Those workers came up short in a vote and a re-run election, but another re-run election has been ordered by a judge due to Amazon\u2019s misconduct.\n\nIn early 2022, Brown said he spoke out against being ordered to work in a department in the warehouse known for Covid-19 outbreaks, and began speaking with a co-worker with similar concerns about the workplace. They decided to start organizing for improvements.\n\nThe group faced significant challenges, especially as a grassroots organization in a \u201cright-to-work\u201d state, where employees can receive full union representation without paying union dues. He said assistance from the Southern Workers Assembly and Black Workers for Justice in North Carolina had been pivotal in getting the union vote organized.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in North Carolina, I knew very few people that belonged to a union. I know very few people that I will have a conversation with that could tell you anything about a union,\u201d Brown explained.\n\nDespite North Carolina having one of the lowest union densities, in the US, at 2.7% in 2023, Brown said communities in North Carolina such as his had significant organizing experience, though it is based in the church.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in the rural south, I realized that my church was the epicenter of most people\u2019s lives,\u201d added Brown. \u201cThe other challenge, the most important challenge to us is Amazon is such a terrible employer, that you can inoculate folks, educate folks, and either they quit or they\u2019re terminated. And so that\u2019s where we were inspired to start the theme about organizing, \u2018don\u2019t quit, organize.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown was ultimately fired after a verbal altercation he had outside the Amazon warehouse during the Thanksgiving holidays. Brown, who is Black, disputes Amazon\u2019s characterization of the incident. The company also fired two additional workers leading in union organizing at the site last year, with Amazon denying any retaliation.\n\n\u201cThey painted me to be this angry, racist Black man,\u201d claimed Brown.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Eileen Hards, said in response to Brown\u2019s termination, \u201cwhile we don\u2019t normally discuss personnel matters, since Mr Brown has chosen to push misinformation to the media, we\u2019re compelled to share the facts. Mr Brown was terminated for repeated misconduct that included making derogatory and racist comments to his co-workers.\u201d\n\nBrown characterized the union fight as historic, in the sense that workers have always fought back against poor treatment by corporations. He argued this fight was more imperative now given the stark wealth and income inequality in the US and Amazon\u2019s vast presence in industries throughout the economy, and a fight for future generations and the American labor movement as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight for children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, because I don\u2019t want them living in an America where you tell your children to do everything right, to go to school, study hard, get an education,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get out of school, but have so much debt that they already have a house mortgage. You tell them to go find a good job, but even though they\u2019re educated, there are no jobs out there and the jobs that they do find, they don\u2019t provide a living wage where they can be a part of the American dream.\n\n\u201cSo our fight is connected with the past, the present and the future. And the preacher in me would like to say that when you look at the historical narrative of Goliath, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. But someone has to start fighting that Goliath.\u201d\n\nItalo Medelius-Marsano, who has worked at RDU1 since 2022 while completing law school, argued the work environment and power disparities between associates and managers at Amazon had incited the push for a union at the warehouse.\n\n\u201cIf we do win this one, it\u2019s going to be historic in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we can win this thing, we would be the first Amazon union in the south, second in the nation, and we already have a lot of strategic insights from the other union drives.\u201d\n\nHards, the Amazon spokesperson, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we want our employees to have their voices heard, and we hope and expect this process allows for that. We believe our employees favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits \u2013 including health care on day one, pre-paid college tuition, and a 401k with company match \u2013 opportunities for career growth, and more.\u201d",

            "content": "A few weeks before Christmas, Amalia Bulacios found the perfect gift for her daughter. The Disney Princess backpack she wanted was around $40 on Amazon \u2014 a fourth of what similar items cost in Buenos Aires.\n\nTo Bulacios\u2019 dismay, however, customs duties and fees more than doubled the original price of the item, which wouldn\u2019t arrive until after Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe price difference seemed huge at first,\u201d Bulacios, an economist at S&P Global Ratings who covers MercadoLibrei MercadoLibre Founded in Argentina in 1999, MercadoLibre is an online marketplace that also owns Mercado Pago, a leading payment and financial services app in Mexico and Argentina.READ MORE , Latin America\u2019s biggest e-commerce platform, told Rest of World. \u201cBut in the end, it just didn\u2019t make sense. What I had to pay on top of the price of the backpack was even more than the backpack itself.\u201d MercadoLibre has a BB+ rating at S&P, signifying a moderate risk level.\n\nIn September, Argentines were thrilled when Amazon said it would charge a flat rate of $5 on shipments from the U.S. But the company\u2019s landing in the South American nation, where crushing tariffs and labyrinthine regulations have kept imports historically low, has been rocky at best. Competition is stiff: Argentina is both the birthplace and stronghold of MercadoLibre, which recently launched international shipping. It is also home to a widespread and popular network of smugglers who have for years ferried foreign goods aboard commercial flights.\n\nBefore the introduction of a flat rate for shipping, Amazon deliveries to Argentina could add up to more than the original price of the item. https://www.amazon.com/\n\nThe government announced in November that it would lower taxes on goods purchased abroad, but Amazon\u2019s success is far from guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe e-commerce market in Argentina has enormous potential,\u201d Yanina Lojo, founder at Consultora Lojo, a firm specializing in foreign trade issues in Argentina, told Rest of World. \u201cBut this is just getting started; there\u2019s still no widespread adoption because there\u2019s a lot of unfamiliarity with the new system. Amazon has the advantage of being the most globally recognized brand, but the competition from MercadoLibre in Argentina is simply too strong.\u201d\n\nLong-standing protectionism in Argentina has meant that items from abroad often spend weeks held up in customs. Electronics cost a staggering 90% more in the country compared to the U.S., according to PriceStats, a firm that compiles online prices. Argentina also consistently ranks among the most expensive countries in the world for iPhones. A 256GB iPhone 16 Pro Max, for instance, is currently listed in Buenos Aires for over $3,100 \u2014 more than double the price of a comparable model in the U.S.\n\nTextiles, too, face similar markups. A $100 fleece jacket on Amazon can end up costing almost double in Buenos Aires. Even with Amazon\u2019s discounted shipping rates, importing goods remains out of reach for many Argentines.\n\nThese conditions created fertile ground for the success of MercadoLibre, an e-commerce giant that grew from a Buenos Aires garage in 1999 to a regional powerhouse with a market cap of $100 billion. It has become the preferred destination for millions of Argentines for their online purchases. Its reach extends across a number of countries in Latin America, and is particularly strong in Mexico and Brazil.\n\nThe high import taxes have also forced locals hungry for foreign-made goods to get creative. A network of smaller-sized companies which facilitate imports for a fee has grown in recent years, in tandem with the emergence of bagayeros, or informal couriers who bring goods in suitcases on commercial flights and upcharge by as much as 60%.\n\nAmazon upgraded to free shipping in Argentina in November, shortly after introducing $5 shipments. Still, delivery delays and a broad sense of mistrust from Argentines mean bagayeros remain a go-to option for many. \u201cPeople think Amazon will sweep through the market, but as a consumer, you\u2019ll still end up paying a lot even if you do it this way,\u201d Juan, a young Argentine man who works in the tourism industry and moonlights as a bagayero, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cThere may be more enthusiasm now with free shipping, but these private transactions still make much more sense for low-ticket items,\u201d said Juan, who did not give his last name to preserve his anonymity since the practice of bagayeros is not legal.\n\nIn November, Javier Milei, Argentina\u2019s libertarian president and Donald Trump ally, began exempting $400 per shipment from import tariffs and raised the total value limit from $1,000 to $3,000. He touted the move as a holiday relief package which would give Argentines a chance to shop for bargains on U.S. platforms after a year of economic hardship and recession.\n\n\u201cImported products will now be cheaper and will compete in an e-commerce market that already has a high level of penetration,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Zaied, president of the Argentine Chamber of E-commerce, told Rest of World. The market saw 23.2 million buyers in 2023, with nearly 1.4 million new shoppers year on year, according to trade association data. The potential for growth remains significant in the country, where e-commerce still only accounts for 18% of all retail sales.\n\nAmazon declined a request for comment from Rest of World regarding its Latin America strategy. While shipping promotions in Argentina have indeed drawn attention, its investments in the country fall short of the $5 billion deployed in neighboring Brazil since 2011 or its rapid expansion seen in Mexico in recent years.\n\nIn October, shortly after Amazon introduced its $5 shipment fee, Luis De Dominicis, 28, decided to surprise his mother with a gift: a slow cooker. He was stunned to find it priced at around $250 on MercadoLibre \u2014 nearly five times what it cost on Amazon in the U.S. Even after he accounted for additional fees and customs duties that doubled the item\u2019s price, as well as shipping delays, it made more sense to buy it on Amazon, he told Rest of World.\n\nDe Dominicis had stumbled upon the practice known as drop-shipping. Exploiting the limited variety of products available locally, some sellers in Argentina list U.S. goods at sky-high prices, importing them only after receiving an order. It\u2019s a strategy that thrives on the scarcity of options and the logistical challenges faced by consumers, and which could be brought to an end if door-to-door imports are indeed facilitated as the government has promised.\n\nStill, De Dominicis believes Amazon\u2019s influence will remain limited. \u201cOnly a small group of Argentines will benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people are simply not aware of how to make an international purchase, or may not be willing to wait.\u201d\n\nIn November, MercadoLibre\u2019s Argentina website drew over 100 million visits, according to analytics firm Semrush, far outpacing the 5.3 million Argentines who visited Amazon\u2019s U.S. site in the same period. While Amazon could eventually boost its numbers with aggressive pricing, it remains a far cry from MercadoLibre\u2019s widespread adoption.\n\nEven as Milei continues to chip away at red tape and works on facilitating business investment, experts and consumers say it will likely take a long time for foreign companies to make sizable foreign direct investments.\n\n\u201cWhat Amazon is doing so far feels like an early-stage effort \u2014 more of a test to gauge the market\u2019s response, and one that is very easy to unwind,\u201d said Bulacios.\n\nMeanwhile, many like De Dominicis remain loyal to MercadoLibre.\n\n\u201cFor mid-range items like clothing or electronics \u2014 things that are neither dirt-cheap nor outrageously expensive \u2014 Amazon is definitely convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for everyday purchases, I\u2019ll stick with MercadoLibre. Their lightning-fast shipping is just unbeatable.\u201d",

            "content": "'Without us, nothing is delivered': Amazon workers demonstrate outside a warehouse in Montreal. | Photo via CSN\n\nMONTREAL\u2014Instead of preparing for upcoming bargaining sessions on their first contract, after a long-fought unionizing campaign, Amazon workers in Qu\u00e9bec were notified Wednesday that they were all being laid off.\n\nThe warehouse workers at the DXT4 facility are represented by the labor union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN). Like Amazon workers at facilities across North America and Europe, they began their union campaign because of low wages and poor health and safety measures at the warehouses.\n\n\u201cAwful working conditions, frequent work injuries, and low wages have become the norm for Amazon around the world,\u201d the union said. In April last year, DXT4 became the first unionized warehouse in Canada after a two-year struggle.\n\nAccording to Canada\u2019s Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, Amazon Canada Fulfillment Services, the corporate entity that operates Amazon warehouses in Canada, recorded more than 1,300 workplace injuries in 2022, resulting in more than $4.4 million in required compensation payouts to workers.\n\nHowever, as the U.S. government\u2019s OSHA revealed, Amazon systematically suppresses its reported injury rate, so it\u2019s likely much higher. The same culture prevails at the company\u2019s Canadian facilities. Typically, when an Amazon worker gets hurt on the job, the worker is sent to a company in-house doctor. Not sending them to an independent doctor often means not reporting injuries.\n\nWorkers in Qu\u00e9bec were expecting to receive the company\u2019s opening offer in contract negotiations, but instead Amazon announced it will phase out all operations across seven sites in the province, which holds the only facility in Canada with unionized workers, over the next two months. All warehousing, order fulfillment, and logistics will be contracted out to a third party.\n\nUnion-busting at its core\n\nThe CSN, which represents 300 workers at the warehouse just north of Montreal, stated in a press release that Amazon\u2019s decision is illogical and specifically targets the company\u2019s sole unionized warehouse in Canada.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the closings announced today are part of an anti-union campaign against CSN and Amazon employees,\u201d said CSN President Caroline Senneville. \u201cThis move contradicts the provisions of the Qu\u00e9bec Labour Code, which we will strongly oppose.\u201d\n\nQu\u00e9bec labor laws are very strict on employer interference with the unionization process. Under sections 12, 13, and 15 of the Qu\u00e9bec Labour Code, corporations cannot \u201chinder the activities of an association of employees nor intimidate, threaten, or retaliate against workers for exercising their rights.\u201d\n\nThe move by Amazon to shut down operations in Qu\u00e9bec, home to the company\u2019s only unionized warehouse, but nowhere else in Canada led the union to conclude it was a blatant act of union-busting\u2014not unlike the countless instances of violating U.S. labor law at facilities south of the border.\n\n\u201cThis decision makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d Senneville said. \u201cNeither from a business point of view, nor from an operational point of view\u2026. Amazon, one of the most integrated companies between the click of a mouse and home delivery, would entrust all its warehousing and distribution operations throughout Qu\u00e9bec to a third party?\u201d\n\nSimilar to warehouses in the U.S., such as JFK8 in New York and in BHM1 Bessemer, Ala., Amazon previously spent considerable time and resources trying to challenge the legality of the union.\n\nPrivatization schemes for maximum profit\n\nIt\u2019s evident that Amazon\u2019s intention is not to abandon Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s market. Instead, this move is a retaliatory measure intended to convey a message that any threat to Jeff Bezos\u2019 non-union monopoly in Canada will not be tolerated. It serves as a warning to potential union organizers that they could face severe consequences, including massive layoffs. The timing is significant, too, with these mass terminations occurring shortly after the successful union drive at the DXT4 facility in Qu\u00e9bec inspired other warehouse workers to follow suit.\n\nAll the while, the company has made it clear that it intends to revert to the pre-2020 model of operation, which involves outsourcing all distribution to \u201clocal\u201d subcontractors: companies that will hire laid-off workers through precarious contracts without any opportunity for unionization (for example, temporary work agencies). For instance, Intelcom, one of Amazon\u2019s subcontractors in Qu\u00e9bec, has already announced that it will hire workers to perform the tasks required by Amazon.\n\nAmazon often attributes all its success to Bezos\u2019 business acumen, but some argue that many of the things the company boasts about, like its delivery and package logistics, could be carried out by a public postal service. Creeping privatization of the mail, in fact, has been a key driver of Amazon\u2019s growth.\n\nThe contract campaign by the American Postal Workers Union and its allies in the U.S. stands as an example of resistance to this trend. The APWU has been fighting for a new contract that, among other things, prevents the Trump administration from privatizing the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nAmazon\u2019s \u201clast mile\u201d policy is all about orchestrating competition between the private and public sectors. The goal is to gradually allow private monopoly to replace public service, or more accurately, to strip any lucrative operations from the public postal service that can then be handed over to private companies like Amazon, FedEx, UPS, and so on.\n\nConversely, non-profitable operations would be left with public service enterprises. In other words, profits are privatized, while losses are socialized. At the same time, more \u201cevidence\u201d of public sector inefficiency is thereby accumulated\u2014ammunition to be used in even more privatization schemes.\n\nFor instance, in Canada, Amazon has no warehouse or delivery operations in Newfoundland. However, the company is still very much present in that Atlantic province. The problem is that for such a small market located on an island, it is not profitable for Bezos\u2019 company to make any investment in warehouses and logistics. Therefore, it relies on the publicly-owned Canada Post to deliver its packages while keeping the bulk of the profits to itself.\n\nCanada Post\u2019s share of the distribution market in amounts to 60%; the rest is in the hands of private monopolies, including Purolator, which is owned by Canada Post. Nevertheless, when Canadian postal workers went on strike (before being ordered back to work) last fall, Canada Post instrumentalized the situation to pretend that its operations were \u201cnot profitable.\u201d\n\nIt was an attempt to force workers to lower their wage demands so that Canada Post could be \u201ccompetitive\u201d with the private monopolies (including its own Purolator company).\n\nPrivatization of public services in favor of private monopolies has been a global trend that comes and goes for decades, but it is recently back in vogue. For instance, Georgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s right-wing premier, privatized Poste Italiane. In Britain, the Royal Mail is practically defunct.\n\nPrivatization not only offers public services to private corporate interests but also forces delivery workers from all employers to compete with each other, leading to lower wages and poorer working conditions that negatively impact the working class as a whole. Add in rampant union-busting and you have a dangerous recipe for austerity and despair.\n\nUnchecked monopoly power requires a fightback\n\nAmazon is a champion at blackmailing the working class and doesn\u2019t pass up any opportunity for retaliation against workers who try to organize. It is also, however, a champion at blackmailing governments and public enterprises.\n\nIn Scarborough, in east Toronto, for example, Amazon forced Canada Post to build a new sorting plant on its own premises to handle Amazon packages. If it failed to do so, Amazon threatened to halt any and all cooperation with Canada Post. The Scarborough shakedown proved that Bezos and his company cannot, in fact, operate without the indirect help of public funding.\n\nFor that very reason, it\u2019s crucial that labor pressures government leaders\u2014whether in Qu\u00e9bec, elsewhere in Canada, or in the U.S.\u2014not to sign a blank check to Amazon or any private corporation. As history has demonstrated, the sole interest of these corporations lies in maximizing profits at the expense of working people.\n\nNow is not the time to bow down to Amazon and other private corporations. Instead, it is the time to defend and expand public services, particularly the post.\n\nPeople\u2019s World, we believe news and information should be free and accessible to all, but we need your help.

And it's ultra-significant because it's Amazon,\" Fountain said.\n\nThe change takes effect on Jan. 26.\n\n\"Amazon has now been legally declared to be a participant in the chain of distribution of products,\" Fountain said. \"That may not sound like much to the average person, but from a legal standpoint, that creates a huge duty on Amazon to be aware of and monitor and provide notice of safety defects and recalls to the consumer.\"\n\nThe latest alerts include a corn puff snack with an undeclared milk allergen and a Lexmark printer recalled because it could catch on fire.\n\nFountain believes this ruling by the Consumer Product Safety Commission will arm consumers with much-needed safety information.\n\n\"I do believe that this will cut down on people having problems with defective products. It will cut down on injuries. It'll save lives and save lawsuits as well,\" Fountain said.\n\nAnd he wants people to remember that they play a key role in keeping others safe. If you experience a defect or dangerous product, report it to the manufacturer, report it to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and report it to Amazon, even if you didn't buy it there.\n\n\"Right now somebody in Wisconsin is having a problem with a product, and they're reporting that. And it's gonna save you or me from having that same problem down the road. And the public is a huge, important part of the safety matrix in this country. So you see something, say something,\" Fountain said.\n\nAmazon released a statement saying the company is disappointed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission's decision and plans to appeal.\n\n\"When we were initially notified by the CPSC three years ago about potential safety issues with a small number of third-party products at the center of this lawsuit, we swiftly notified customers, instructed them to stop using the products, and refunded them.\n\n\"The remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\" Amazon's statement said in part.",

Once seen as an instrument for pushing product listings, Amazon\u2019s DSP has evolved into a versatile ad buying platform, vying for market share against heavyweights like Google\u2019s DV360 and The Trade Desk.\n\nAs Stephen Tyler Reagan, president and chief strategy officer at MindgruveMacarta, explained: \u201cAmazon is stealing budget share from Google and The Trade Desk due to their comparative CPMs, specifically for their standard audiences and remarketing audiences (which range from $2.50 to $4).\u201d\n\nDespite this progress, Amazon\u2019s DSP isn\u2019t yet the dominant force in programmatic advertising. Conversations with ad buyers over the last three months reveal that Amazon is still seen as a challenger rather than a frontrunner \u2014 at least for now. The consensus? It won\u2019t stay that way for long.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t if Amazon will challenge the largest DSPs \u2014 it\u2019s when, said Kevin Weiss, VP of Retail Media at Skai.\n\n\u201cIf Amazon DSP can keep growing the money spent on its own and operated [inventory] as well as through Performance+ and Brand+ then by the end of 2026, it will either be the market leader or a bigger rival to the incumbents,\u201d Weiss continued.\n\nThe long game: Reframing Amazon\u2019s DSP\n\nUnsurprisingly, Amazon has big ambitions for its DSP. \u201cEventually, we want it to be the largest AI-driven buying platform for all digital marketers,\u201d said MacLean.\n\nTo get there, Amazon knew it had to make changes \u2014 and it has. Over the past three years, the company has transformed its DSP from a clunky conversion workhouse into a streamlined, full-funnel marketing platform. Key upgrades like the integration of the Amazon Marketing Cloud and Publisher Cloud now give marketers richer cross-channel data, while tools like Performance+ and Brand+ deliver sharper optimization and creative options.\n\nAd buyers call it faster, smoother and significantly more user-friendly. Add to that the DSP\u2019s tantalizingly low 1% take rate for programmatic, guaranteed deals \u2014 a stark contrast to Google\u2019s, as highlighted in the recent antitrust case.\n\n\u201cAll the changes have brought the DSP to a point where it bridges the gap between ad dollars and sales outcomes,\u201d said Jared Belsky, co-founder and CEO of Acadia. \u201cThe retail media component is something other DSPs will struggle to replicate.\u201d\n\nBetting on behavior, not cookies\n\nWith the third-party cookie chaos, Amazon has sidestepped the scramble for new identifiers. Instead, it\u2019s leveraging its deeper understanding of shopper behavior, blending deterministic data (based on observed user behavior) and probabilistic insights (modeled predictions) to power campaigns.\n\n\u201cToo many marketers had become overly reliant on the false precision of cookies, while others were scrambling to find the next big identifier,\u201d said MacLean. \u201cWe wanted to take a different approach. We\u2019re focusing on real-time signals rooted in our expertise with shopping journeys.\u201d\n\nFor those already using Amazon DSP, the result of these changes speak for themselves: sharper targeting and measurable outcomes. But for Amazon to fully realize those ambitions for its DSP, it must convince advertisers outside its ecosystem \u2014 those not already selling on Amazon \u2014 to buy in.\n\nEyes on the open web\n\nThe real opportunity for Amazon lies beyond its own walls. Prime Video ads have added some diversity to its client base, but the DSP\u2019s future hinges on establishing a stronger foothold across the open web \u2014 a move critical to attracting advertisers who don\u2019t rely on Amazon as a retail channel. That\u2019s why one of the most significant yet understated aspects of Amazon\u2019s DSP overhaul has been its ongoing efforts to establish proprietary pathways to supply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant investments in our supply desk internally, where we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re making it easy to transition dual libraries and to create custom deals for marketers and agencies to get access to any type of supply that they would want,\u201d said MacLean.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely new territory for Amazon\u2019s DSP \u2014 marketers have been buying display ads outside the retailer\u2019s ecosystem for years. But now, this aspect of Amazon\u2019s pitch feels sharper, more intentional. The company is doubling down, essentially telling marketers: advertise wherever you like \u2014 just let us handle it for you.\n\n\u201cThis is really helping marketers access a broader audience across the web in a cross channel way,\u201d said MacLean. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily need to work with multiple providers to reach all of the best publishers, including Prime Video across the internet.\u201d\n\nWhile the upgrades have made running display ads better, the results still lag behind its bread-and-butter: product listing ads. Contextual signals could be the link that closes that gap, according to those executives who\u2019ve discussed the strategy with Amazon leaders like Chris Conetta, head of supply and buyer services for Amazon Ads.\n\n\u201cAmazon can\u2019t take the search model, which is the source of the intent signals that power its advertising, off site,\u201d said an ad exec, who exchanged anonymity for candor on these plans. \u201cSo they\u2019re working with ad tech partners to help build something that can help them figure out what that intent looks like off-site.\u201d\n\nFuture state\n\nRetail media has been drifting toward adland for years, but Amazon\u2019s DSP might be the bridge that finally connects the two. Its unmatched first-party data, seamless integration with Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, dominance in streaming and growing appeal to non-endemic advertisers make it a formidable player.\n\nAd buyers are taking note. More marketers are rethinking their budgets, blending brand and performance campaigns, and adapting to a landscape where retail media isn\u2019t just another channel \u2014 its becoming the backbone of modern advertising.\n\nAmazon, with its scale and influence, is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift faster than its rivals. Its DSP, while still moving, is already hard to ignore.",

            "content": "Amazon Bedrock Flows offers an intuitive visual builder and a set of APIs to seamlessly link foundation models (FMs), Amazon Bedrock features, and AWS services to build and automate user-defined generative AI workflows at scale. Amazon Bedrock Agents offers a fully managed solution for creating, deploying, and scaling AI agents on AWS. With Flows, you can provide explicitly stated, user-defined decision logic to execute workflows, and add Agents as a node in a flow to use FMs to dynamically interpret and execute tasks based on contextual reasoning for certain steps in your workflow.\n\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce multi-turn conversation with an agent node (preview), a powerful new capability in Flows. This new capability enhances the agent node functionality, enabling dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue in a flow execution.\n\nWith this new feature, when an agent node requires clarification or additional context from the user before it can continue, it can intelligently pause the flow\u2019s execution and request user-specific information. After the user sends the requested information, the flow seamlessly resumes the execution with the enriched input, maintaining the executionId of the conversation.\n\nThis creates a more interactive and context-aware experience, because the node can adapt its behavior based on user responses. The following sequence diagram shows the flow steps.\n\nMulti-turn conversations make it straightforward to developers to create agentic workflows that can adapt and reason dynamically. This is particularly valuable for complex scenarios where a single interaction might not be sufficient to fully understand and address the user\u2019s needs.\n\nIn this post, we discuss how to create a multi-turn conversation and explore how this feature can transform your AI applications.\n\nSolution overview\n\nConsider ACME Corp, a leading fictional online travel agency developing an AI-powered holiday trip planner using Flows. They face several challenges in their implementation:\n\nTheir planner can\u2019t engage in dynamic conversations, requiring all trip details upfront instead of asking follow-up questions\n\nThey face challenges to orchestrate complex, multi-step travel planning processes that require coordinating flights, accommodations, activities, and transportation across multiple destinations, often leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal customer experiences\n\nTheir application can\u2019t dynamically adapt its recommendations when users modify their preferences or introduce new constraints during the planning process\n\nLet\u2019s explore how the new multi-turn conversation capability in Flows addresses these challenges and enables ACME Corp to build a more intelligent, context-aware, and efficient holiday trip planner that truly enhances the customer\u2019s travel planning experience.\n\nThe flow offers two distinct interaction paths. For general travel inquiries, users receive instant responses powered by an LLM. However, when users want to search or book flights and hotels, they are connected to an agent who guides them through the process, collecting essential information while maintaining the session until completion. The workflow is illustrated in the following diagram.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nFor this example, you need the following:\n\nCreate a multi-turn conversation flow\n\nTo create a multi-turn conversation flow, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Bedrock console, choose Flows under Builder tools in the navigation pane. Start creating a new flow called ACME-Corp-trip-planner .\n\nFor detailed instructions on creating a Flow, see Amazon Bedrock Flows is now generally available with enhanced safety and traceability.\n\nBedrock provides different node types to build your prompt flow.\n\nChoose the prompt node to evaluate the input intention. It will classify the intentions as categoryLetter=A if the user wants to search or book a hotel or flight and categoryLetter=B if the user is asking for destination information. If you\u2019re using Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management, you can select the prompt from there.\n\nFor this node, we use the following message in the prompt configuration:\n\nYou are a query classifier. Analyze the {{input}} and respond with a single letter: A: Travel planning/booking queries for hotel and flights Example: \"Find flights to London\" B: Destination information queries Example: \"What's the weather in Paris?\" Return only 'A' or 'B' based on the primary intent.\n\nFor our example, we chose Amazon\u2019s Nova Lite model and set the temperature inference parameter to 0.1 to minimize hallucinations and enhance output reliability. You can select other available Amazon Bedrock models.\n\nCreate the Condition node with the following information and connect with the Query Classifier node. For this node, the condition value is: Name: Booking Condition: categoryLetter==\"A\" Create a second prompt node for the LLM guide invocation. The input of the node is the output of the Condition node output \u201cIf all conditions are false.\u201d To end this flow branch, add a Flow output node and connect the prompt node output to it. You are AcmeGuide, an enthusiastic and knowledgeable travel guide. Your task is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about travel destinations to users. When answering a user's query, cover the following key aspects: - Weather and best times to visit - Famous local figures and celebrities - Major attractions and landmarks - Local culture and cuisine - Essential travel tips Answer the user's question {{query}}. Present the information in a clear and engaging manner. If you are unsure about specific details, acknowledge this and provide the most reliable information available. Avoid any hallucinations or fabricated content. Provide your response immediately after these instructions, without any preamble or additional text.\n\nFor our example, we chose Amazon\u2019s Nova Lite model and set the temperature inference parameter to 0.1 to minimize hallucinations and enhance output reliability.\n\nFinally, create the agent node and configure it to use the agent that was created previously. The input of the node is the output of the Condition node output \u201cConditions Booking.\u201d To end this flow branch, add a Flow output node and connect the agent node output to it.\n\nChoose Save to save your flow.\n\nTest the flow\n\nYou\u2019re now ready to test the flow through the Amazon Bedrock console or API. First, we ask for information about Paris. In the response, you can review the flow traces, which provide detailed visibility into the execution process. These traces help you monitor and debug response times for each step, track the processing of customer inputs, verify if guardrails are properly applied, and identify any bottlenecks in the system. Flow traces offer a comprehensive overview of the entire response generation process, allowing for more efficient troubleshooting and performance optimization.,\n\nNext, we continue our conversation and request to book a travel to Paris. As you can see, now with the multi-turn support in Flows, our agent node is able to ask follow-up questions to gather all information and make the booking.\n\nWe continue talking to our agent, providing all required information, and finally, the agent makes the booking for us. In the traces, you can check the ExecutionId that maintains the session for the multi-turn requests.\n\nAfter the confirmation, the agent has successfully completed the user request.\n\nUse Amazon Bedrock Flows APIs\n\nYou can also interact with flows programmatically using the InvokeFlow API, as shown in the following code. During the initial invocation, the system automatically generates a unique executionId , which maintains the session for 1 hour. This executionId is essential for subsequent InvokeFlow API calls, because it provides the agent with contextual information necessary for maintaining conversation history and completing actions.\n\n{ \"flowIdentifier\": \" MQM2RM1ORA\", \"flowAliasIdentifier\": \"T00ZXPGI35\", \"inputs\": [ { \"content\": { \"document\": \"Book a flight to paris\" }, \"nodeName\": \"FlowInputNode\", \"nodeOutputName\": \"document\" } ] }\n\nIf the agent node in the flow decides that it needs more information from the user, the response stream ( responseStream ) from InvokeFlow includes a FlowMultiTurnInputRequestEvent event object. The event has the requested information in the content( FlowMultiTurnInputContent ) field.\n\nThe following is an example FlowMultiTurnInputRequestEvent JSON object:\n\n{ \"nodeName\": \"Trip_planner\", \"nodeType\": \"AgentNode\", \"content\": { \"document\": \"Certainly! I'd be happy to help you book a flight to Paris. To get started, I need some more information: 1. What is your departure airport (please provide the IATA airport code if possible)? 2. What date would you like to travel (in YYYYMMDD format)? 3. Do you have a preferred time for the flight (in HHMM format)? Once I have these details, I can search for available flights for you.\" } }\n\nBecause the flow can\u2019t continue until more input is received, the flow also emits a FlowCompletionEvent event. A flow always emits the FlowMultiTurnInputRequestEvent before the FlowCompletionEvent . If the value of completionReason in the FlowCompletionEvent event is INPUT_REQUIRED , the flow needs more information before it can continue.\n\nThe following is an example FlowCompletionEvent JSON object:\n\n{ \"completionReason\": \"INPUT_REQUIRED\" }\n\nSend the user response back to the flow by calling the InvokeFlow API again. Be sure to include the executionId for the conversation.\n\nThe following is an example JSON request for the InvokeFlow API, which provides additional information required by an agent node:\n\n{ \"flowIdentifier\": \"MQM2RM1ORA\", \"flowAliasIdentifier\": \"T00ZXPGI35\", \"executionId\": \"b6450554-f8cc-4934-bf46-f66ed89b60a0\", \"inputs\": [ { \"content\": { \"document\": \"Madrid on Valentine's day 2025\" }, \"nodeName\": \"Trip_planner\", \"nodeInputName\": \"agentInputText\" } ] }\n\nThis back and forth continues until no more information is needed and the agent has all that is required to complete the user\u2019s request. When no more information is needed, the flow emits a FlowOutputEvent event, which contains the final response.\n\nThe following is an example FlowOutputEvent JSON object:\n\n{ \"nodeName\": \"FlowOutputNode\", \"content\": { \"document\": \"Great news! I've successfully booked your flight to Paris. Here are the details: - Date: February 14, 2025 (Valentine's Day) - Departure: Madrid (MAD) at 20:43 (8:43 PM) - Arrival: Paris (CDG) Your flight is confirmed.\" } }\n\nThe flow also emits a FlowCompletionEvent event. The value of completionReason is SUCCESS .\n\nThe following is an example FlowCompletionEvent JSON object:\n\n{ \"completionReason\": \"SUCCESS\" }\n\nTo get started with multi-turn invocation, use the following example code. It handles subsequent interactions using the same executionId and maintains context throughout the conversation. You need to specify your flow\u2019s ID in FLOW_ID and its alias ID in FLOW_ALIAS_ID (refer to View information about flows in Amazon Bedrock for instructions on obtaining these IDs).\n\nThe system will prompt for additional input as needed, using the executionId to maintain context across multiple interactions, providing a coherent and continuous conversation flow while executing the requested actions.\n\n\"\"\" Runs an Amazon Bedrock flow and handles multi-turn interactions \"\"\" import boto3 import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) def invoke_flow(client, flow_id, flow_alias_id, input_data, execution_id=None): \"\"\" Invoke an Amazon Bedrock flow and handle the response stream.

            "content": "Amazon suspends drone delivery in Texas, Arizona\n\nBy DRONELIFE Features Editor Jim Magill\n\nAmazon recently announced it was suspending its drone delivery services at its facilities in College Station, Texas and Tolleson, Arizona until further notice.\n\nThe company, which in 2020 received its FAA Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate \u2014 authorizing it as an airline able to deliver small packages via drone \u2014 shut down its delivery service on January 17 in order to implement software changes.\n\n\u201cSafety underscores everything we do in Prime Air and our MK30 drone is safe and compliant. It\u2019s designed to safely respond to unknown events in a known way, and the overall architecture of the drone has performed as expected,\u201dAmazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said in a statement.\n\nThe pause in operations comes after a safety incident occurred in December at an Amazon testing facility in Pendleton, Oregon, although Amazon said the incident was not directly related to its suspension decision. According to published reports, two drones undergoing tests crashed as a result of a software malfunction caused by light rain. One of the drones reportedly caught fire upon impact.\n\nStephenson said the Pendleton incident was \u201cnot the primary reason for our voluntary operational pause.\u201d He added that Prime Air continued to make deliveries to its customers safely and within federal compliance until the company voluntarily paused the service.\n\n\u201cThese incidents occurred at our private and closed testing facility, where the purpose of these tests is to push our aircraft past their limits \u2013 it would be irresponsible not to do that,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cWe expect incidents like these to occur in those tests, and they help us continue to improve the safety of our operations.\u201d\n\nHe added that Prime Air\u2019s commercial MK30 drone operations \u201chave been conducted safely and in compliance with all FAA regulations and requirements.\u201d\n\nAmazon Prime Air\u2019s drone delivery business has gone through a series of ups and downs since it first began to test out its commercial drone delivery business model in College Station and Lockeford, California in December 2022.\n\nThe next month Amazon announced the largest headcount reduction in its history, slashing 18,000 jobs to improve its financial results. Although Prime Air was among the Amazon business segments hit by the layoffs, the company said the job cuts would not result in the shutdown of its drone delivery test programs in College Station and Lockeford.\n\nAmazon announced the expansion of its drone delivery service in College Station to include the delivery of prescription drugs in October 2023.\n\nThe following April, citing strategic business reasons, Amazon Prime said it was shutting down its pilot delivery project in Lockeford. The same month, the company announced a planned expansion into Tolleson, Arizona, part of the Phoenix Metro area, as part of its broader effort to roll out its commercial drone delivery business across the country.\n\nThen in May, 2024, \u201ceverything store\u201d Amazon announced that it had received FAA approval to conduct Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) missions around the College Station area.\n\nLast July, citing noise complaints from residents, College Station Mayor John Nichols, in a letter to the FAA, urged the agency to slow down an Amazon Prime Air\u2019s effort to expand its drone delivery operations in the city. The letter was sent as a comment on an Amazon draft environmental impact statement (EIS) requesting FAA\u2019s permission to introduce its new MK30 drone and expand commercial drone package delivery operations from its center in the city.\n\nIn its draft EIS, Amazon said the MK30 is smaller and lighter therefore 40% quieter then the MK27.2 model that Amazon was then flying. The MK30 was also designed to be capable of flying in inclement weather, enabling it to expand the number of hours it could be flown per day, the company said.\n\nAmazon Prime Air completed the expansion of its drone delivery services into Tolleson in November 2024 The Tolleson program was said to mark a new strategic direction after the company had ended its delivery initiative in Lockeford.\n\nThe company gave assurances that its latest setback was only temporary and said that employees at both its Tolleson and College Station facilities would remain on the job and be paid through the pause in service.\n\n\u201cOur services will resume once these updates are completed and approved by the FAA,\u201d Stephenson said\n\nWant DRONELIFE news delivered to your inbox every weekday?

Over 75 new jobs were created with the new facility and Bailey says this could also grow.\n\n\u201cOffering opportunities whether you were looking for a full-time job, part-time job or you\u2019re a student at Colorado Mesa University looking to earn some income as well,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nMike Olish, Grand Valley resident and site lead has lived on the Western Slope since 2019, and to be recruited by Amazon fueled his passion to impact the community.\n\n\u201cAmazon, as a company, moving to the western Slope was a signifier to me of the great economic changes that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Olish. \u201cThat sort of opportunity was something that I was looking for. How can I make a bigger impact in my community?\u201d\n\nCurrent Amazon Delivery Driver Joseph Ervin said the response from the community has been nothing but positive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really cool to see that, how excited people are to see that we are finally here and we\u2019re ready to work,\u201d said Ervin.\n\nAccording to Mayor Abe Herman, $25 million was invested into the facility, and it was put up in record time to accommodate the growing needs of the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this 20 years ago or 30 years ago, but we\u2019re in great economic situation now as a community and that\u2019s only going to grow from here,\u201d said Herman. \u201cI think Amazon is seeing that, and investing in the community is really indicative of the track that we\u2019re on and the progress that we\u2019ve made on economic development.\u201d\n\nHerman and those who manage the flow of the new delivery station shared the sense of optimism, and said it will contribute to the economic development of Grand Junction and beyond.\n\n\u201cThis is our first expansion onto the western slope of Colorado, and the community has been nothing but wonderful to work with,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our partnership with them to expand here in the Western Slope.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2025 KJCT.

            "content": "The Amazon, with its immense ecological and cultural wealth, faces pressing challenges in balancing biome protection and infrastructure development. This vast region remains one of the poorest in South America, with limited access to economic opportunities, essential services, and poor living standards.\n\nBoosting the bioeconomy, which involves economic activities that protect forests, can improve livelihoods in a sustainable way. However, this potential is held back by major infrastructure issues: poor transportation networks, unreliable energy access, and limited digital connectivity. To unlock the bioeconomy's benefits, we need to address these gaps while ensuring the Amazon's unique ecosystems are protected.\n\nThe World Bank Transport team used data analytics to explore the gaps in transport, digital access, and bioeconomy infrastructure in the Amazon areas of Brazil, Colombia and Peru.\n\nThe Amazon's Four Connectivity Clusters show the disparity in connectivity\n\nWe used advanced technology and data sources to identify key infrastructure areas in the Amazon. By analyzing satellite images, Google Building Data (which helps estimate population density), Open StreetMaps, and mobile phone data (which indicates digital connectivity), the World Bank transport team discovered four main infrastructure clusters.\n\nHigh Connectivity/Urban Areas (5%): These areas have strong transport and digital connections and are the main centers of economic activity in the Amazon. They are the cities that serve as hubs for services, infrastructure, and commerce, but they are surrounded by many disconnected communities. By investing more in these cities, we can turn them into drivers of regional development, helping to connect rural areas and promote inclusive growth throughout the Amazon.\n\nLow Connectivity/Rural Area (60%): These areas have poor infrastructure and digital connections, making it hard for residents to access essential services. The lack of connectivity means these communities struggle to integrate into the broader economy, often lacking proper healthcare, education, and market access. Improving infrastructure in these rural areas is vital to reduce isolation, provide essential services, and promote better economic integration across the Amazon.\n\nNo Connectivity/Remote Settlements (9%): These areas lack transport or digital infrastructure, leading to severe isolation, although they have a low population. Without reliable access, the people living here face food shortages and economic challenges. Because of the low population density, investments should focus on affordable, scalable, and community-driven solutions to improve basic services and boost resilience.\n\nNo Connectivity/Pristine Forests (26%): These untouched ecosystems are vital for biodiversity and must be strictly protected from human activities.\n\nWaterways are an untapped, sustainable transport solution\n\nWaterways can be a competitive, cost-effective, and eco-friendly alternative to roads. However, it's important to develop and maintain them carefully to avoid harming aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAround 51% of the Amazon has natural high to medium connectivity to waterways. However, limited investment in waterway infrastructure has restricted economic activity and kept many communities isolated. Despite most cities in the Brazilian Amazon being connected by rivers, waterway services suffer from low frequency, inconsistent water levels, and reliance on expensive, polluting fuel. Of Brazil's 63,000 km of rivers, only about 20,000 km are navigable, and just 6,500 km are used for regular commercial shipping.\n\nIn contrast to waterways, 33% of the Amazon region has high or medium connectivity to all-season roads. The road network includes official highways like the 4,000 km Trans-Amazonian highway, built in the 1970s, and many unofficial roads that contribute to deforestation. Since the late 1950s, the Amazon's transportation system has focused on road transport, often ignoring the unique needs of each area and leading to unsustainable growth.\n\nMapping the digital divide in the Amazon\n\nDigital connectivity in the Amazon is significantly underdeveloped, showing major regional disparities. Using Google's building footprint data (as a proxy for population density and development) and Ookla's internet speed metrics, the World Bank found that only 8% of the Amazon benefits from high building density and high-speed internet.\n\nMeanwhile, 12% of the Amazon has high building density but inadequate internet speeds, indicating areas where urban development has progressed, yet digital connectivity has lagged. This creates urgent opportunities for targeted digital improvements.\n\nIn the most remote areas, 38% of the Amazon has low building density and low internet speed, showing severe connectivity issues for dispersed communities. Additionally, 42% of the region lacks comprehensive data coverage, making it difficult to assess digital infrastructure needs.\n\nClosing these digital gaps is crucial for inclusive development, integrating Amazonian communities into the broader economy, and improving access to services like healthcare and education. Improved digital connectivity would also open new market opportunities and reduce inequality in the region.\n\nUnlocking the potential for bioeconomy and connectivity\n\nThe Amazon's bioeconomy includes renewable resources like brazil nuts, cupua\u00e7u, a\u00e7a\u00ed, and aquatic resources like pirarucu fish, which are vital for economic and ecological sustainability. However, 56% of pirarucu production occurs in low-connectivity areas, creating logistical challenges, raising costs for producers, and limiting market expansion. These constraints reduce revenue for small-scale farmers and hinder food security efforts in the region.\n\nHow to achieve sustainable infrastructure development in the Amazon\n\nGiven its vast and diverse landscape, infrastructure investments in the Amazon should be prioritized based on the specific needs of each area to maximize impact and minimize environmental risks. Improving infrastructure in bioeconomy-rich areas can enhance supply chains and strengthen food security, provided it safeguards biodiversity and respects conservation priorities.\n\nBy aligning infrastructure investments with conservation goals, the Amazon can foster long-term economic growth while preserving one of the world\u2019s most valuable ecosystems. Advanced spatial data analytics are crucial in identifying strategic investment opportunities that support sustainable development and conservation in the Amazon.\n\nNote: This work is carried out under the Amazon Region: Addressing Infrastructure Gaps to Unlock the Sustainable, Resilient and Inclusive Development, supported by the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (SFLAC)",

            "content": "In 1998, the big-box bookstore chain Barnes & Noble was fictionalized on the silver screen in the rom-com \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d as Fox Books \u2014 a slick, impersonal retailer crushing independent shops.\n\nTwo decades later, Barnes & Noble \u2014 known for sharp discounts, sprawling shelves and Starbucks coffee \u2014 has embraced the same local, community-first charm it once seemed destined to destroy as it looks to fend off competition from the new bully on the block: Amazon.\n\nBarnes & Noble\u2019s novel approach to corporate bookselling seems to be paying off. After a decade of falling sales and store closures, Barnes & Noble has reversed the trend and is expanding again. In 2024 alone, the company opened 57 new stores across the U.S., with plans to open 60 more in 2025. Barnes & Noble is also exploring a possible IPO in London or New York, according to The Financial Times. Finally, book sales, which make up about 60% of the retailer\u2019s total revenue, are booming.\n\n\u201cThe long and the short is that we have grown from 2019, so pre-Covid,\u201d Barnes & Noble\u2019s CEO James Daunt told Modern Retail in an interview. \u201cWe are hugely up in [the book category]. It\u2019s just been fantastic.\u201d\n\nDaunt took the reins after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. bought Barnes & Noble in August 2019 and took the company private. At the time, the bookstore appeared to be another casualty of Amazon\u2019s online retail dominance.\n\nA British businessman, Daunt is no stranger to resuscitating struggling bookstores. In 2011, he was hired to rescue the beleaguered U.K. bookstore chain Waterstones from falling sales. His plan to save Waterstones, of which he is still the CEO, revolved around giving individual stores control over their book selection and reducing the influence of corporate directives. The strategy bore fruit, restoring Waterstones to profitability. He has sought to replicate the same indie bookstore model with Barnes & Noble\u2019s fleet of 600 stores in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t that physical bookselling didn\u2019t have a valid place,\u201d Daunt said. \u201cThe problem was that Barnes & Noble wasn\u2019t running good enough bookstores.\u201d\n\nThe indie bookstore model\n\nDaunt\u2019s strategy wasn\u2019t without its risks. In order to cater to the tastes of local clientele, Barnes & Noble stopped accepting payments from publishers for in-store promotions. Previously, publishers would pay Barnes & Noble for prime placement of their books. This practice, while lucrative in the short term, cluttered stores with books that customers didn\u2019t necessarily want to buy, leading to high return rates \u2014 that is, the number of unsold books that retailers return to publishers. Around 30% of books were returned to publishers before Daunt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a big, big, big, big number. So that\u2019s a bit terrifying,\u201d Daunt said. \u201cBut it unlocks a dramatic cost saving on the other side. You don\u2019t have to discount so much, so you\u2019re not constantly just trying to get rid of stuff.\u201d\n\nSince stopping this system, Barnes & Noble\u2019s return rate has dropped dramatically, falling to just 7% by 2024. This reduction has not only saved the company millions in shipping and labor costs but also improved store efficiency, as the books on display are more closely aligned with what customers actually want to buy.\n\nBarnes & Noble\u2019s new model is drawing more shoppers into stores. Average visits per square foot have increased over the last three years, according to location analytics company Placer.ai. Customers are also lingering, with nearly three in 10 visitors staying 45 minutes or longer.\n\nBarnes & Noble has also changed how it hires store employees. When Daunt took over, the vast majority of Barnes & Noble employees were part-time, working under a retail model designed to minimize costs by keeping most employees under the threshold for receiving benefits. This directly contradicted the ability to develop a skilled, committed workforce of booksellers, according to Daunt, who has set about changing that.\n\nDaunt has prioritized promoting from within, stating that nearly all new store managers come from internal promotions, which contrasts with the previous model of hiring from outside the book industry. This shift has directly contributed to the company\u2019s ability to execute Daunt\u2019s vision of localized, well-curated stores\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re shifting towards a career model where we have full-time booksellers who are invested in the business,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s goal is to increase the percentage of full-time employees, mirroring the approach Daunt successfully implemented at Waterstones, where the full-time to part-time ratio essentially flipped over the course of a decade.\n\nWhile Barnes & Noble is still on that journey, Daunt is confident that investing in booksellers will pay dividends. \u201cBetter stores mean better sales, which means we can afford to hire better people, and the cycle continues,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, Daunt\u2019s success in revitalizing Barnes & Noble suggests that retail companies need to hire executives who understand the business of shopping.\n\n\u201cThe passion and understanding of the category is really important because James Daunt understands books,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cHe has an intimate knowledge of how the category works and what the consumer wants.\u201d\n\nE-commerce: A work in progress\n\nWhile Barnes & Noble is finding success with its physical stores, its e-commerce platform remains a work in progress. Online sales soared during the pandemic, but they have since dropped back to pre-pandemic levels \u2014 a sharp contrast to Waterstones in the U.K., where e-commerce sales have continued to grow.\n\n\u201cIn the U.K., we\u2019ve nailed the e-commerce side, but in the U.S., the platform is garbage,\u201d Daunt said.\n\nNot only is Barnes & Noble up against Amazon\u2019s dominance in online retail, but the company faces competition from emerging players like Bookshop.org, an online bookstore that shares profits with independent bookstores. To compete, Daunt plans to revamp Barnes & Noble\u2019s digital infrastructure and improve its membership program, which has already grown from 1 million to 18 million members in the past year. Still, Daunt is clear that Barnes & Noble\u2019s success won\u2019t come from trying to out-Amazon Amazon. \u201cPeople will buy books from us not because we\u2019re cheaper or faster but because we\u2019re a fun, engaging place to buy books,\u201d Daunt said.\n\nDaunt is careful not to define the company in opposition to its online rival Amazon. Instead, Barnes & Noble is carving out its own niche, focusing on what it can offer that Amazon cannot: a personalized, human-driven experience, tailored to each store\u2019s community. It\u2019s a formula that independent bookstores have figured out, too, and have seen growth as a result. For instance, the American Booksellers Association, which represents more than 2,5000 independent bookstores, saw its membership swell by 11% in 2023 as more brick-and-mortar, pop-ups and online stores opened, according to data cited by USA Today.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing a good physical bookstore has to fear from Amazon,\u201d Daunt said. Far from being Barnes & Noble\u2019s nemesis, Daunt sees Amazon as part of the same ecosystem, even a catalyst for raising the standard of bookselling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike Amazon,\u201d Daunt said. \u201cAnything that democratizes the buying of books is good. Anything that makes people buy more books is good. And they do.\u201d\n\nIn Daunt\u2019s eyes, Amazon\u2019s efficiency in selling what he refers to as \u201cboring books\u201d \u2014 manuals, textbooks, technical volumes \u2014 has allowed Barnes & Noble to focus on what it does best: curation and creating an inviting, enjoyable bookstore experience.\n\nEven though Amazon has revolutionized convenience and selection, it can\u2019t replicate the joy of a passionate bookseller recommending a favorite title, or the excitement of discovering a book serendipitously on a beautifully arranged display table.\n\n\u201cAmazon recommendations are driven by an algorithm,\u201d GlobalData\u2019s Saunders said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, and it works to a certain extent. But it doesn\u2019t have the same personal touch as when you go into a Barnes & Noble, where you can receive a personal recommendation, and there are handwritten recommendation cards from members of staff who work in the store.\u201d\n\nFor Daunt, this human element is key to Barnes & Noble\u2019s success. As he put it, \u201cNobody wants to buy a book from Amazon. It\u2019s a dispiriting experience if your alternative is a really nice bookstore.\u201d",

[Courtesy: Amazon Prime Air]\n\nAmazon Prime Air, the drone delivery arm of the e-commerce giant, is temporarily halting operations in Texas and Arizona to upgrade its drones\u2019 software.\n\nThe move follows crashes at Prime Air\u2019s test facility in Pendleton, Oregon, in September and December, first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a software issue was the culprit behind two previously unreported crashes of the firm\u2019s MK30 drone in December. Prime Air spokesperson Sam Stephenson told FLYING the incident was not the \u201cprimary reason\u201d the company voluntarily suspended all commercial service on Friday\u2014that would be the software upgrade, he said. But Stephenson could not say whether the upgrade is linked to the software issue reportedly involved in the crashes.\n\nThe pause comes as the beleaguered drone delivery service was beginning to gather momentum with key FAA approvals that extended its coverage radius.\n\n\u201cSafety underscores everything we do in Prime Air, and our MK30 drone is safe and compliant,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to safely respond to unknown events in a known way, and the overall architecture of the drone has performed as expected\u2026Our services will resume once these updates are completed and approved by the FAA.\u201d\n\nThe FAA declined to comment on this story, instead directing FLYING to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the two MK30 drones\u2014one of which caught fire after impact\u2014were grounded due to light rain interfering with their software. NTSB accident investigation notifications indicate no injuries, but the agency will conduct a Class 4 investigation\u2014considered the least extensive category\u2014to determine what went wrong. An aviation safety inspector with the FAA\u2019s Portland office is listed as an additional investigator.\n\nThe NTSB and FAA are also investigating a crash in September involving two MK30 drones that collided during testing. Amazon told Bloomberg it modified its training and procedures following that incident.\n\n\u201cThese incidents occurred at our private and closed testing facility, where the purpose of these tests is to push our aircraft past their limits\u2014it would be irresponsible not to do that,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cWe expect incidents like these to occur in those tests, and they help us continue to improve the safety of our operations.\u201d\n\nPrime Air\u2019s temporary shutdown comes just a few months after the company launched service in Phoenix\u2019s West Valley, which became its second U.S. market\u2014joining College Station, Texas\u2014after operations in Lockeford, California, were shuttered last year. In both locations, its remote pilots have FAA approval to fly drones beyond their visual line of sight (BVLOS), which can extend the aircraft\u2019s range and open the service to more customers.\n\nIn August, Prime Air was selected as one of six participants in a set of U.K. drone delivery trials, bolstering its plans to expand to the U.K. and Italy.\n\nAt the same time, the firm has barely scratched its goal of completing 500 million drone deliveries per year by the end of the decade. It also faces pushback from College Station residents, who have complained about the drones\u2019 noise and opposed a planned expansion of the service.",

The toolkit provides an open-source framework for automating the construction of a graph from unstructured data, and composing question-answering strategies that query this graph when answering user questions.\n\n\n\nPreviously, customers faced challenges in conducting exhaustive, multi-step searches across disparate content. By identifying key entities across documents, GraphRAG delivers insights that leverage relationships within the data, enabling improved responses to end users. For example, financial analysts can ask a financial analysis chatbot for the sales forecast of a manufacturing company. Developers building Generative AI applications can enable GraphRAG via this new open-source Python toolkit by specifying their data sources and choosing Amazon Neptune Database or Neptune Analytics as their graph store and Amazon OpenSearch serverless as the vector store. This will automatically generate and store vector embeddings in the selected vector store, along with a graph representation of entities and their relationships in the selected graph store.\n\n\n\nThe GraphRAG Toolkit is an open source project. Its code base is open for inspection, modification, and extension, and is therefore highly adaptable for specific or niche requirements. With its initial release, the toolkit provides graph store implementations for both Neptune Analytics and Neptune Database, and vector store implementations for Neptune Analytics and OpenSearch Serverless, and it uses FMs hosted in Amazon Bedrock.

            "content": "Shopping for a new Hyundai? You can now complete the entire checkout process and arrange financing through Amazon as part of a \"beta\" launch of the tech giant's new platform for car buying, Amazon Autos.\n\nHyundai is running commercials promoting how easy it now is to buy a car just by adding it to your Amazon shopping cart. One even shows a customer picking up a new vehicle from a local dealership the next day.\n\nIn another ad, a teenage girl teases her dad at breakfast that his pancakes are \"pretty mid.\" The narrator remarks that you can buy a Hyundai on Amazon in the time it would take to learn Gen Z slang.\n\nBuying a car the old fashioned way (in person) can be painfully time-consuming. It's such a process that many dealerships have lounges and snack bars to try to keep shoppers patient as they're filling out what can feel like an endless amount of paperwork and waiting for their financing to be approved before getting the keys to their new set of wheels.\n\nAmazon's new car-buying platform caters to shoppers who don't want to spend half a day or more on the transaction.\n\n\"This collaboration allows customers to conveniently discover, learn about and purchase their preferred Hyundai model from their local dealer through one of the world's most trusted shopping experiences,\" Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, Hyundai's president and CEO, said in a release. \"It represents the future of automotive retail.\"\n\nCar-buying moves online\n\nIn recent years, the auto industry has seen the rise of pre-ordering, which lets shoppers customize vehicles online to their preferred specifications. The drawback is that you have to wait weeks or even months before you can actually get behind the wheel.\n\nSince many car buyers want to shop online but also want to be able to get into their next vehicle immediately, automakers \u2014 and third-party companies like Amazon \u2014 are now trying to innovate to meet that demand.\n\nThere's evidence that these efforts are paying off. According to a new Cox Automotive study, new-car buyer satisfaction reached a record high in 2024. The company said the surge can be attributed to \"digital tools, pricing transparency and a balance between online and in-person dealership experiences.\"\n\nAmazon is marketing its new initiative as the quickest way to buy a car. According to the company, it's an \"end-to-end\" purchase experience, meaning you can browse available Hyundai vehicles in your area, get a quote for the value of your trade-in, check out and schedule your pick-up \u2014 all without leaving the Amazon platform.\n\nWhile the ease of buying a car with a couple of clicks has clear appeal, there are some potential trade-offs that you should have on your radar. For one thing, in the current version of Amazon Autos, only select Hyundai dealerships are participating, which means vehicles and trim options are limited. You also can't shop for other brands, although an Amazon spokesperson told Money the company plans to add more automakers later this year.\n\nAnother thing you can't do on Amazon Autos is haggle. The price you see \u2014 which includes taxes and fees \u2014 is the price you pay. This means you might end up paying more for the car, since upfront pricing means you can't use your negotiating skills to score a deal. You can get approved for financing during the checkout process and complete the necessary paperwork on Amazon's site or app.\n\nAgain, while convenient, this is a potential drawback in terms of cost. If you buy a Hyundai on Amazon, your current options for financing are limited. Not being able to use the lender of your choice means you might not get the best rate, although Amazon said leasing and more financing options are coming to Amazon Autos later this year.\n\nAds by Money.

            "content": "There are more cars and scooter traffic in South Lake Union now that Amazon workers have returned to the office full-time. New data from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) and other agencies shows the Seattle-area commute is now much slower at times.\n\nA new report from the roadway analytics company INRIX states that tens of thousands of Amazon employees commuting daily to downtown Seattle has led to commuter backups on highways connecting suburbs, \u201cwith commute times doubling in some cases.\u201d Officials add the frequent bottleneck delays are a result of increased stress on road infrastructure, as highways and local streets struggle to accommodate the sudden surge in vehicle traffic.\n\nINRIX acknowledges the mandate\u2019s positive impact on downtown revitalization, while noting the roadway challenges, including slower speeds. INRIX reports interstate speeds have slowed to around 40 miles an hour or lower at times on I-90, I-405 and I-5 southbound from Everett and northbound from Tacoma.\n\n\"I drive to work. It\u2019s probably doubled in time- at least 10 minutes longer,\" said Allie Ivester, who works in SLU.\n\nThe organization, in summary, encourages corporations and local stakeholders to work together moving forward to create sustainable solutions for a more sustainable transportation system that can handle the traffic boost.\n\nRELATED:\n\nIn the first full week of Amazon\u2019s return-to-office policy, SDOT observed up to a 9% increase in SLU traffic compared to the same time frame last year, the agency stated. The problem spots are major intersections along Mercer Street, like Dexter, Westlake and Fairview for those heading to or from I-5; to Elliot Avenue near Lower Queen Anne.\n\nOne Amazon employee skips driving altogether.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always walked and it\u2019s a lot easier than having to deal with this at rush hour at 9 a.m.,\" stated Jasiel Lopez. \"I don\u2019t really agree with the whole policy.\"\n\nALSO SEE:\n\nOfficials noted that despite increased traffic at some intersections in the broader downtown area, \u201coverall downtown traffic remains lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This reflects ongoing shifts in commuting patterns as businesses and workers adjust.\u201d The agency monitors traffic at 13 intersections across Mercer Street, Madison Street, and South Holgate Street.\n\nLime reports its ridership has more than doubled in January 2025 compared to the same time frame last year across multiple categories.\n\nALSO SEE:\n\nLime scooter Seattle ridership overall: 138% increase in total trips, 144% increase in average daily riders\n\nDowntown: 137% increase in total trips, 141% increase in average daily riders\n\nSouth Lake Union: 146% increase in total trips, 136% increase in average daily riders\n\nThe company noted it significantly boosted the number of scooters in its Seattle fleet since the same time frame last year due to ridership demand.\n\nA spokesperson for Sound Transit said it\u2019s still weeks from knowing the impacts to light rail and ST Express service due to Amazon\u2019s return to office mandate.\n\nRELATED:\n\nAn Amazon provided the following information about its commuter benefits intended to give employees more flexibility for their commute:\n\nThese vary by location, but include funded or reimbursable public transportation in all major metro areas, free commuter shuttles, flexible commuter subsidy funds per month for parking, rideshare, carpool, and bike-related costs, and onsite bike cages and shower facilities for employees who bike to work.\n\nOfficials added local municipalities manage traffic, and most Amazon-owned and managed garages have staff to help direct traffic.\n\n\"In the Puget Sound area, we\u2019ve worked to support local and state investments in local traffic and transit infrastructure. Many of our offices in the area, and all of our Offices in Bellevue, are within a reasonable walking distance of public transit stations. Our real estate and commute team has increased services and routes on our shuttles in Bellevue and Seattle,\" the statement explains.\n\nThe non-profit Commute Seattle reports less than 25-percent of people commuting to downtown are driving, but the organization is in talks with Amazon and other employers to come up with ways to make the commute easier for everyone.\n\n\"We want to make sure everyone knows what those (multimodal) options are. We also want to make sure those options are workable,\" Commute Seattle Executive Director Alex Hudson stated.",

There are multiple ways to explore this integral part of South America and a lot to consider when planning a trip, including the fragility of the ecosystem and the millions of people who live there. There are 400 Indigenous and ethnic Amazonian groups who live amid the trees and along the rivers and streams.\n\nUnderstanding the Amazon\n\nBoat tours take visitors deep into the Amazon (Image credit: Florence Goisnard / AFP / Getty Images)\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is the most biologically diverse area on the planet. Sloths, pink dolphins, poison dart frogs, toucans and piranhas all call it home, with new species constantly being discovered. Dense forests cover 1.4 billion acres of the landscape, and because of its \"essential role\" in the Earth's oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles, the Amazon is known as the \"lungs of the planet,\" the BBC said.\n\nAbout 60% of the Amazon is in Brazil, but the Amazon spans Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela and French Guiana, an overseas department of France. Most of the 40 million people who live in the Amazon are in urban centers, the World Wildlife Fund said, and rely on the rainforest's \"natural bounty for food, shelter and livelihoods.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Instead, the \"quintessential experiences\" are more \"sublime than superlative,\" like canoeing, hiking under the tree canopy or boating up the Amazon River.\n\nEven though the elusive jaguar may not cross your path, wildlife and birdwatching should be at the top of your agenda. The \"pristine\" Baixo Rio Branco extractive reserve in Brazil is an \"outstanding place to immerse yourself in the best the Amazon has to offer,\" with \"excellent\" wildlife watching amid an \"immaculate\" forest \"teeming with birds and animals\" like macaws and howler monkeys.\n\nWonders are not just spotted on land. The Meeting of the Rivers is the confluence between the whitewater Amazon and blackwater Rio Negro, one of \"nature's marvels,\" The Guardian said. Because the Amazon is several degrees cooler than the Rio Negro, they run side by side for miles without mixing. It is a popular sight on boat tours and river expeditions.\n\nTeatro Amazonas is more than 125 years old (Image credit: Brasil2 / Getty Images)\n\nThe Amazon's largest city is Manaus, Brazil, a \"breakneck jungle metropolis\" with \"far-flung foods, frenetic markets and river-driven way of life,\" Lonely Planet said. Attend an opera performance at the \"opulent\" Teatro Amazonas, constructed during the city's rubber boom during the late 1800s, and check out MUSA in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, with its museum, sensory garden, aquarium and observation tower.\n\nMany Amazonian adventures begin and end in Manaus, but consider launching a trip outside of Brazil. \"Colombia's slice of the Amazon isn't as well-known,\" Medell\u00edn travel advisor Boris Seckovic said to Travel and Leisure, and it is \"almost better that way.\" There are \"far fewer people here,\" giving you a \"much better chance of encountering wildlife.\"\n\nHow to visit responsibly\n\nVisitors are encouraged to be part of the Amazon's conservation efforts (Image credit: Farid El Messaoudi / Getty Images)\n\nThe Amazon's \"precious ecosystem\" is under attack, with threats from \"huge-scale farming and ranching, infrastructure and urban development, unsustainable logging, mining and climate change,\" the World Wildlife Foundation said. Acres of rainforest are being decimated daily, and while trees in the Amazon are still holding about 56.8 billion metric tons of carbon, fires being intentionally set to clear land are tipping the Amazon toward being a \"net carbon source.\" This is why visitors to the Amazon are asked to tread lightly and respect both the land and its inhabitants.\n\nSimple rules to follow include carrying out trash you bring into the rainforest, listening to the biologists and guides leading treks and staying a safe distance from wildlife. When choosing accommodations, go with eco-lodges that work with or are run by the local community and focus on habitat and wildlife protection.\n\nThe Cristalino Lodge in Brazil is a \"collection of small bungalows, with hammocks strung on the porches\" spread out \"among flower beds and forest paths,\" Travel and Leisure said. Visitors are paired with naturalist guides who take them on forest walks and river excursions twice a day. Water is heated by solar energy, and the \"splendid\" meals are made with local ingredients like acai and cassava.",

But this week that program is on hold.\n\nAmazon on Friday suspended all commercial drone activity, called PrimeAir, which includes its programs both in College Station and in Tolleson, Arizona. According to Bloomberg, the tech company said it was fixing the software for its MK30 drones.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"We're currently in the process of making software changes to the drone and will be voluntarily pausing our commercial operations,\" Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said in a statement to Bloomberg. \"Safety underscores everything we do in Prime Air and our MK30 drone is safe and compliant. ...

One of the drones caught fire.\n\nThe MK30 drones were approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October and represent an upgrade from Amazon's previous PrimeAir craft, which College Station residents bemoaned over the buzzing noises it made.\n\n\"It sounds like a giant hive of bees,\" College Station resident John Case told CNBC about the old drones in the summer. \"You know it's coming because it\u2019s pretty loud.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nCollege Station Mayor John Nichols asked the FAA in July to postpone PrimeAir because of the alleged noisy drones. In September, the FAA found that the drone program posed no significant impact on the environment, which allowed Amazon to continue flying its drones. But the change was made to the MK30s in October.\n\nIn December, Amazon touted the new MK30s for being able to travel twice as far as the former craft, and for being \"significantly quieter.\"\n\n\"It is the first drone we have developed from the ground up using a requirements-based process including more stringent requirements that will allow us to eventually reach a half billion customers annually,\" PrimeAir Chief Project Engineer Stephen Wells said in an Amazon story about the MK30s. \"We designed it with aerospace levels of reliability and redundancy.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

On this page, you can find out more about the current state of Amazon in Europe.\n\nContent:\n\nAmazon launched its website in the US in 1995 and after three years it opened its digital doors in the United Kingdom, while also launching Amazon Germany. In the years after that, it quickly expanded in Europe with many dedicated websites. According to the company, Amazon has invested 215 billion euros in Europe since 2010.\n\nAmazon is launching a dedicated marketplace in Ireland\n\nIt now has dedicated online stores in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and Belgium. In 2024, Amazon announced that it will launch a dedicated online store in Ireland. The launch will take place in 2025.\n\nAmazon\u2019s logistics operations in Europe\n\nThroughout Europe, Amazon has a network of fulfillment centers, as well as distribution and logistics centers. In 2023, it had more than 350 logistics sites across Europe, most are located near major cities. In that same year, the company opened its first fulfillment center in the Netherlands, with 2,200 cubic meters of storage space.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2027, Amazon will invest more than \u20ac1 billion into decarbonizing its transportation network\n\nIn 2022, Amazon announced that it will invest over one billion euros by 2027, in an effort to decarbonize its transportation network in Europe. The company wants to become net-zero carbon by 2040.\n\nIt also wants to operate more than 10,000 electric delivery vans across the continent by 2025. In 2024, it launched a rail service to move products between distribution centers in Italy and Germany by train. In 2024, it announced that it is revamping its delivery network in the United Kingdom with micromobility hubs. The company has also invested heavily in renewable energy projects, in an effort to power its operations with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.\n\nLooking for ecommerce software to start selling in Europe? Webador and Shopify are platforms that are well optimized for cross-border ecommerce.\n\nAmazon\u2019s services\n\nThe ecommerce giant started as an online store, but now it also generates revenue with products such as its hosting solution Amazon Web Services and its paid subscription service Amazon Prime. This service was announced in 2005 and later also became available in Europe. Members pay around 50 euros per year, for free and fast delivery. It also includes Prime Video, Prime Gaming, unlimited photo storage and access to deals during Prime Day.\n\nThe ecommerce giant has several services to offer customers faster deliveries.\n\nThe company also offers Amazon Prime Now, giving Prime members the opportunity to have products delivered to them within one hour. It also has a service called Amazon Fresh, through which customers can order deliveries.\n\nThe ecommerce giant also has another product called Amazon Business, a marketplace dedicated to businesses. It started in the US, but it has also launched European marketplaces. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon Business\u2019 gross sales in Europe increased at a compound annual rate of 25 percent. In 2023, it was active in Germany, Britian, Italy, Spain and France. Amazon has plans of expanding it further.\n\n\n\nFulfilment by Amazon\n\nA big part of Amazon\u2019s logistics operations is Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA), which is another one of Amazon\u2019s services. However, this service is geared towards online sellers, not consumers. Sellers can store their products in Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centers with this service. Products are then packed and shipped to customers by the company. By doing so, sellers can offer quicker deliveries. Returns are also handled by Amazon.\n\nProducts that are offered with FBA are also eligible for free shipping and fast, one-day delivery. According to a study conducted by the company in 2020, it can increase sales by up to 26.5 percent. Selling cross-border is also easier with FBA, as online stores can use Amazon\u2019s extensive logistics network.\n\n\n\nCriticism about Amazon\n\nAmazon has more than 220,000 permanent employees in Europe. In the past, there has been quite some controversy regarding the treatment of workers. These concerns were mostly related to the company\u2019s warehouse conditions. After several employee strikes, the company increased its starting wage in 2021.\n\nAmazon increased its starting wage after ongoing criticism.\n\nThere has also been a lot of criticism in Europe about Amazon\u2019s trade practices, which has resulted in legal action. In 2021, the company was fined with 746 million euros by the European Union for violating privacy laws. In that year, Fulfilment by Amazon was fined 1.13 billion euros by Italian antitrust authority AGCM, for abusing its market dominance and disadvantaging competitors. In 2024, the ecommerce giant again received a fine of 10 million euros from AGCM, for unfair trade practices.\n\nThe influence of Amazon in Europe\n\nAmazon is a key ecommerce player that many small and big retailers keep an eye on. If the company launches a certain service or decides to focus on a specific product category, the online retail industry will know about this in a split second. Most of the company\u2019s decisions have a big influence on the market, competition and consumers.\n\n\u2018Other online retailers do not want to lose their market share to the ecommerce giant.\u2019\n\nHowever, that influence also means that the company truly is a market leader. According to a report published in 2023, Amazon even influences offline retail in Germany. More than one-third of all purchases in physical stores are preceded by a search for information on Amazon. And 20 percent of German consumers would shop less if the ecommerce giant is no longer available.\n\nIf Amazon starts offering a certain service (like faster delivery), many online retailers will soon follow, because they do not want to lose their market share to the company. Niche players are afraid the ecommerce giant will one day enter their market and wipe them out with lower prices, better service and faster delivery.\n\nSince 2020, Amazon seller acquisition companies have become very popular. These companies acquire and scale Amazon FBA brands and sellers.\n\nLooking for ecommerce software to start selling in Europe? Webador and Shopify are platforms that are well optimized for cross-border ecommerce.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow are some frequently asked questions about Amazon in Europe:\n\nIn which European countries is Amazon active?\n\nAmazon is active in the following countries in Europe: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the UK, Sweden, Poland and Belgium. In these markets, it has a dedicated, localized ecommerce website. It will launch a dedicated online store in Ireland in 2025.\n\nCan I sell on multiple marketplaces with my Amazon account?\n\nYes, you can! If you have an EU selling account, you can sell products in multiple European marketplaces from that single account. With your Amazon Europe Marketplace Account, you\u2019re automatically allowed to sell on all Amazon EU marketplaces. However, you will get asked to define your local European marketplace, like France.\n\nTo start selling, you need to define your local marketplace.\n\nWhat are the differences between selling on Amazon in the EU and the US?\n\nThere are, of course, more similarities than distinctions between selling on Amazon marketplaces and selling on Amazon.com.\n\nHowever, there are some important differences. For example, there are tax requirements for sales of products to consumers in Europe. And if you have sales on a certain Amazon EU marketplace, you need to make sure you comply with all local regulations.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that certain product standards (like the number of Volts in electronic devices) can differ across Europe. The ecommerce giant also requires that listings and customer support are provided in a marketplace\u2019s local language.",

            "content": "In Q4, beauty brands selling on Amazon faced rising advertising costs, requiring them to be more resourceful with their investments. The holiday season saw a surge in consumer activity as shoppers were looking for gifts, deals, and seasonal products. To capitalize on this heightened demand, more brands were competing for the same ad placements, driving up CPCs through Amazon\u2019s auction-based system. Many brands allocate a significant portion of their annual advertising budgets to Q4, and this influx of ad spend intensifies competition and leads to higher CPCs.\n\nBrands were also focused on driving external traffic to their Amazon listings to boost organic rankings, which ultimately helped reduce their reliance on paid ads. Top-performing brands in their categories understood the importance of diversifying their traffic sources, leveraging social media and influencers to amplify visibility and direct consumers to Amazon. K-beauty brands provide an excellent example, using TikTok to create viral moments and build awareness. With 72% of K-beauty consumers influenced by recommendations from influencers and a strong preference for online shopping over physical stores, these brands have effectively prioritized investments in digital channels to capture demand and drive growth.\n\nHow should beauty brands approach Amazon advertising budgets in 2025? Dave Karlsven, SVP of Data Science and Advertising at Market Defense, offers expert insights into strategic budget planning for beauty brands navigating the Amazon ecosystem in the year ahead:\n\nOn Planning Ad Budgets for the Year Ahead:\n\n\n\n\"Brands should think beyond seasonal spikes and plan a more holistic, year-round approach. Budgeting for 2025 means anticipating higher ad costs, allocating funds for testing new ad formats (like Amazon Live or Sponsored Display), and building flexibility into the budget to capitalize on emerging channels like TikTok. The best approach is scenario planning\u2014create tiers of spend, track performance closely, and be ready to shift dollars to what\u2019s driving the best returns. Marketing budgets need to be as dynamic as the digital landscape itself.\"\n\nOn Rising CPCs and the Outlook for 2025:\n\n\n\n\"As the advertising ecosystem becomes increasingly competitive, CPCs are likely to continue their upward trajectory, especially for high-intent keywords in the beauty space. Brands will need to optimize aggressively, focusing on highly searched, long-tail keywords, expanding out ad types (for example: sponsored brand video ads) to get lower CPCs on the top keywords, and leveraging Amazon\u2019s or third- party automation tools to stay cost-efficient. The brands that can navigate these higher CPC waters by investing in better creative, refining their product pages, and building a stronger organic presence will still come out ahead because they will have higher conversion rates and lower TACOS rates that allow them to be more aggressive with advertising while still being profitable.\"\n\n\n\nPrevious Reports:\n\nQ3 2024 Amazon Top 25 Beauty & Personal Care\n\nQ2 2024 Amazon Top 25 Beauty & Personal Care\n\nQ1 2024 Amazon Top 25 Beauty & Personal Care",

            "content": "HINESVILLE, Ga. (WTOC) - There are still no answers for the family of 21-year-old Keontae Grider.\n\nHe\u2019s the young father who was killed outside the Amazon fulfillment center on Triple B road last Monday morning. The police have not yet made any arrests in his murder.\n\nSunday there was a balloon release in his honor. Family, friends, and loved ones gathered to speak about the kind of man Keontae was and the legacy he left behind.\n\nAutoplay\n\nKeontae was a sibling of eight and a father to a 2-year-old baby girl. He was also a beloved son and community member in Hinesville.\n\nSunday, those who knew him best spoke kind words about how he loved being around people, always thinking of others before himself, and how his smile would light up any room.\n\nWTOC sat down with Keontae\u2019s parents after that balloon release. They spoke about the respectful and kind young man they raised, and how the entire community is now in mourning as they search for closure.\n\nMonday, January 13th, Pooler Police responded to a shooting outside the Amazon fulfillment center in the parking lot.\n\nEMS workers took 21-year-old Keontae Grider to the hospital with several gunshot wounds, his injuries, too much to survive.\n\nThe coroner confirmed he was shot at least once, while an official autopsy is still in the works.\n\nOur crews saw at least 14 evidence markers in the facility\u2019s parking lot that was blocked by crime tape that day.\n\n\u201cYou would think that we would have more answers by now than what we do,\u201d said Keontae\u2019s father, Timothy Grider.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect to be making arrangements and figuring situations out to bury your own child,\u201d said Keontae\u2019s mother, Tammy Grider.\n\nKeontae\u2019s heartbroken parents said they received gut-wrenching calls Monday morning that their son was killed while at work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a day I\u2019ll never forget. And plus it was my oldest son\u2019s birthday, so my baby boy got killed on my oldest son\u2019s birthday,\u201d said Tammy Grider. \u201cI had called Sheriff Bowman to ask him to find out for me, and when he called me back, just the tears in his voice let me know that the phone calls I received were actually the truth. I think that we shouldn\u2019t have to find out through social media and through friends or people that somebody worked with that our child was dead. I think that was very insensitive. And then tagging my mom in posts on Facebook before I could even get a chance to tell her that her grandchild had passed.\u201d\n\nThey still have not been able to see their son\u2019s body yet.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t get closure until I actually see him. I know it\u2019s real, but it doesn\u2019t feel real. And I know it\u2019s real because he\u2019s not walking through that door anymore every day when he gets off work,\u201d said Tammy Grider.\n\nThe family said three people surrounded their son outside his car while he was on break, officials confirmed this was a targeted attack.\n\n\u201cSo... it just hurts to know that, you know, you work at a place that has so much security, but something like this can just happen,\u201d said Timothy Grider.\n\n\u201cHis HR senior person called. Like he could barely talk because he was crying, and he said Keontae put a smile on his face every day, so who wouldn\u2019t do something to somebody like that? He was a good kid,\u201d said Tammy Grider.\n\nSince Monday no leads have come out regarding who is going to be held responsible--Answers the family said they are anxiously awaiting.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell a two-year-old that they\u2019ll never see their dad again,\u201d asked Tammy Grider.\n\n\u201cYou just think it couldn\u2019t happen to you until the tragedy strikes home,\u201c said Timothy Grider. \u201cFor it to be a last-minute balloon release and to see how many people showed up. It was amazing.\u201d\n\nWhile they wait for those answers, and for justice to be served, they say they\u2019ll always remember Keontae as the amazing father, brother, and son he was.\n\n\u201cFor the people in the community to come and show so much love and just to reach out, it meant a lot,\u201d said Timothy Grider. \u201cWho would know at 21 you can affect so many people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss him coming around, just pulling up at the barbershop. And he\u2019ll walk in and be like, Dad, can I get a haircut,\u201d said Timothy Grider. \u201cHe always loved to be around people. He\u2019s a people\u2019s person. And he genuinely, genuinely cared for other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways, good morning, beautiful. Hello, beautiful. How you doing today, beautiful? And his thing was, he always wanted to take care of everybody,\u201d said Tammy Grider.\n\n\u201cYou gotta love people while they\u2019re here. And so to remember him, I think, his smile and his laughter and the people that he touched, I think it\u2019ll always be remembered and brought up in the community,\u201d said Timothy Grider.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saddened by this senseless act of violence and are focused on supporting our employees during this time,\u201d said an Amazon spokesperson in a statement to WTOC.\n\nWe\u2019re closely monitoring this tragedy and will provide any updates once we get a response from Pooler Police.\n\nCopyright 2025 WTOC.

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) has been a winning investment over time. The stock has advanced more than 1,400% over the past decade, and just last year, it climbed 44%. There's a clear reason for this top performance: Amazon has built leadership in the two high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, and they have helped the company generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit quarter after quarter.\n\nIn recent times, Amazon has added another important focus to its business: artificial intelligence (AI). The company is using this hot technology to improve its operations and gain efficiency, and it's selling AI tools through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing unit. This helped spur excitement about the stock last year, making it one of the stand-out AI players.\n\nNow, though, in the early days of 2025, Amazon hasn't been a stand-out performer. The stock is little changed from the start of the year to the writing of this article on Jan. 17. So, is Amazon a buy, sell, or hold in 2025? Let's find out.\n\nAn e-commerce empire\n\nAmazon has built a worldwide e-commerce empire, and its Prime subscription service now has more than 200 million members. They pay an annual fee to access fast and free delivery of their purchases and a vast menu of entertainment offerings, from books to sports and films. Amazon boasts a high retention rate, with about 97% of U.S. Prime members renewing their membership for a year in the first three months of 2023, according to Statista.\n\nAmazon suffered when interest rates were at their highest a couple of years ago, but the company used that time to revamp its cost structure. And this has proven to be a winning move. The e-commerce giant cut jobs and reshaped its fulfillment network, bringing inventory closer to its destination -- packages now travel from a regional center closer to your home rather than from national centers. This has decreased Amazon's cost to serve, allowing it to continue offering the lowest possible prices to shoppers.\n\nOn top of this, Amazon is using AI to increase warehouse efficiency through robotics and improving the Amazon experience for shoppers and sellers thanks to the use of AI assistants.\n\nThough e-commerce is what most people think of when someone says \"Amazon,\" cloud computing actually drives the company's profits, so AWS has been a key part of Amazon's growth story. As the world's No. 1 cloud services provider, AWS offers users a wide variety of tools and platforms -- and AI has provided this business a significant boost. Thanks to its AI offerings, AWS reached a $110 billion annualized revenue run rate last year.\n\nPresent across every layer of AI\n\nAWS' strategy is simple: Aim to be present throughout every layer of AI, from selling customers basic elements, like chips, to providing a fully managed service that tailors large language models (LLMs) to their projects. AWS is also present in AI apps, such as those that help shoppers find items or developers create code. The business could see additional benefits through the next wave of AI growth, agentic AI. This is software designed to address problems, apply reason, and find and employ a solution.\n\nAWS' Project Amelia now helps sellers with questions like, \"How should I prepare my store for the holidays?\" But eventually, Amelia will \"learn and evolve\" in a true agentic AI fashion. AWS also offers customers tools to build AI agents tailored to their needs.\n\nSo, now let's return to our question: Is Amazon a buy, sell, or hold this year? The stock trades for only 35 times forward earnings estimates today, a drop from more than 42 times just a few weeks ago. This looks particularly cheap, considering Amazon's earnings track record, leadership in two major markets, and position in the high-growth area of AI. This means it's absolutely a bargain buy -- and a hold if you already own it -- for 2025.\n\nThough it's impossible to predict with 100% certainty whether Amazon will mimic last year's top performance, additional earnings and business gains spurred by Amazon's AI investments could act as positive catalysts. Even better, Amazon has what it takes to win over the long haul in e-commerce, cloud, and AI. And that should keep the shares moving higher over time.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Amazon, Microsoft and Google race ahead in artificial intelligence, they are trying to avoid antitrust scrutiny by stopping short of buying hot companies outright and instead investing in them, hiring their top engineers or licensing their technology. A self-described whistleblower is now arguing to regulators that Amazon played it too close, illegally disguising what was effectively an acquisition because it was liable to be blocked, according to his filing obtained by The Washington Post, which includes an executive\u2019s recorded remarks and previously undisclosed deal documents.\n\nThe online retail giant said in August that it had hired three founders and about a quarter of the staff of Covariant AI, an Emeryville, California, start-up that makes neural networking software for warehouse robots. Amazon said it bought a nonexclusive license for the company\u2019s core program, while Covariant itself would live on and pursue other deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCovariant\u2019s models will help drive new ways to generalize how our robotic systems learn and provide dynamic opportunities for how we use automation to make our operations safer and better,\u201d Amazon said in a blog post at the time.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Justice Department asserts that \u201cthe transaction was deliberately and unlawfully structured to evade antitrust enforcement.\u201d It turns on what was not publicly disclosed either in Amazon\u2019s blog post or to federal regulators. That includes the agreed up-front price, $380 million, which well exceeds the $119.5 million threshold above which most deals have to be reported in advance to the FTC and antitrust authorities at the Justice Department.\n\nThe 201-page deal agreement also restricted the sorts of licenses that Covariant could continue to sell to other buyers without paying a penalty to Amazon, effectively turning the company into a \u201czombie,\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s filing said. According to the transcript of a recorded chat included with the filing, the chief executive said after the deal that he only hoped to sell one or two, probably for less than $10 million apiece. The whistleblower filing said Covariant\u2019s husk was only expected to survive for a year after the deal, at which point investors would split a final $20 million payout from Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Angie Quennell said a premerger filing was not required because the company only took a nonexclusive license. She said it did not want Covariant to stop being competitive, noting that some employees remained there.\n\nThe SEC said it could not confirm or deny the existence of any complaint. The FTC and Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nCovariant founders Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen and Rocky Duan all went to Amazon as part of the licensing deal. Abbeel is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, where he taught the other two founders. None responded to messages seeking comment.\n\nA fourth founder stayed at Covariant, and Ted Stinson, who had come in as chief operating officer and a director after his venture firm invested in the company, was promoted to chief executive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe whistleblower, a Covariant shareholder and former employee, said he came forward because more people should be able to reap the benefits of AI. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to live in a world where AI is used to calcify all of the most monopolistic elements in society,\u201d he said in an interview, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve his career prospects. He is not named in the filing.\n\nHis attorney John Tye, a former U.S. government whistleblower who later represented former Facebook executive Frances Haugen and former Twitter security chief Peiter \u201cMudge\u201d Zatko, said his client in the Amazon case was concerned about retaliation in the lucrative and close-knit world of cutting-edge AI.\n\n\u201cMy client is a brave whistleblower who is taking a personal risk to do the right thing. Any attempt to harass my client would violate the law,\u201d said Tye, of the law firm Napier Network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former employee is filing his complaint under the SEC\u2019s whistleblower program, which offers people up to 30 percent of money collected in an enforcement action.\n\nQuennell did not deny that antitrust review was a factor in Amazon\u2019s decision not to buy Covariant, but said there were others, including not wanting to operate that business and serve previous customers or handle employees in China. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)\n\nAlthough the largest tech companies have been striking such deals for a year, the Covariant papers are believed to contain the first explicit terms that have come to light.\n\nAmazon insisted on a special license because it thought a straight purchase attempt \u201cwould have had a transaction blocked,\u201d Stinson, Covariant\u2019s current chief executive, told a former colleague in the recorded conversation, a transcript of which was included in the filing. \u201cThey paid more, in a way, to structure the transaction the way that they did \u2026 but it was the only way possible\u201d without provoking antitrust authorities to kill the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuennell said Amazon would have expected to pay more in a full purchase than it did for a license. Stinson declined to comment.\n\nThe deal documents were included in the filing sent this week to the SEC as well as to U.S. and U.K. antitrust regulators. Tye said an FTC official told him Wednesday that she was reviewing the filing.\n\nCovariant\u2019s specialized AI helps robots see, analyze and move, and they will become better by handling new materials and shapes at Amazon facilities, the whistleblower said. Because Amazon uses so many robots already in its massive e-commerce shipping operation and is a major player in artificial intelligence, a purchase would have probably drawn scrutiny from regulators concerned about concentration limiting the development of other smart robots.\n\nThe 11-page document signed by Tye maintains that Amazon should have made a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law, and that it also broke laws against expanding a monopoly into a new area. \u201cAmazon obviously has a dominant position in e-commerce; it used that dominant position to impose questionable terms on Covariant; the deal allows Amazon to expand its dominant position to advanced robotics far beyond the realm of e-commerce,\u201d the document says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcquisitions where the main goal is obtaining senior employees have long been known as \u201cacquihires\u201d; a spate of more recent \u201creverse acquihires\u201d leave the target companies standing, if barely.\n\nThe FTC is investigating a similar deal in which Microsoft agreed to pay a reported $650 million to license and resell technology from Inflection AI. The agency also asked Amazon for details about its June licensing and hiring deal with AI start-up Adept. That deal was likewise for a nonexclusive license, with the dollar amount and other terms undisclosed.\n\nThree Democratic senators asked the FTC and Justice Department to investigate the Adept deal. \u201cIf this pattern of reverse acqui-hiring continues, it will undoubtedly harm competition and stifle innovation in the emerging AI industry,\u201d they wrote in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA month later, Amazon struck the deal with Covariant, with both sides pledging to keep the price and other key elements confidential for five years.\n\nOutgoing FTC Chair Lina Khan has expressed concern about acquisitive tech behemoths restricting AI progress. Her Republican successor, Andrew Ferguson, has also taken a tough line against Big Tech, but he has spoken more on perceived censorship than artificial intelligence.\n\nAI in general and acquihires in particular will still be in the crosshairs in the new administration, said antitrust expert Luis Blanquez of Bona Law, \u201cmainly because of the risk that they might stifle innovation by preventing start-ups from growing independently, while at the same time consolidating more power within Big Tech.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the Covariant disclosures will draw no action, a fine, a demand that the deal be unwound or a clearer stance on reverse acquihires more broadly. If an antitrust violation is established, the whistleblower could be in line for compensation by the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome legal experts said elements such as those in the Covariant filing provide a plausible case. A key factor could be the terms under which Covariant can sell licenses to others.\n\nQuennell said Covariant was free to sell without restriction.\n\nThe agreement, however, spells out what sorts of customers could get which kind of license without incurring financial penalty. In the transcript of the recorded conversation, Stinson said that left the company with the prospect of selling only lower-tier technology for far less money. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a decent shot at pulling off one or two of these license deals. But they\u2019ll be single-digit millions, maybe double-digit millions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAmazon wants to have their cake and eat it too,\u201d Stinson complained, according to the transcript. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t want us to be able to use this technology, but \u2026 they knew Covariant had to exist so they couldn\u2019t completely say, you know, \u2018You\u2019re crippled.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "Retail is emerging from its inflation slump, and most of the country's large retailers demonstrated important progress last year. Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) and Costco Wholesale (COST 0.02%), the two largest U.S. retailers behind first-place Walmart, ended the year with solid growth and healthy stock gains.\n\nLet's see what each of these companies brings to the investing table and which one is the better buy today.\n\nThe case for Amazon: Not just retail\n\nAmazon is the largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S. It has higher sales than Costco, and it's still growing faster. It's also more profitable.\n\nCompany Sales Sales Growth Net Income Amazon $158.9 billion 11% $15.3 billion Costco $61 billion 7.5% $1.8 billion\n\nAmazon accounts for around 40% of all U.S. e-commerce sales, a breathtaking lead that's unchallengeable in the near term. It's taking all kinds of actions to protect its position and become the source of even more of its loyal Prime members' shopping, like a new distribution network to keep products closer to customers and get them out faster. E-commerce remains Amazon's core business, and it's still growing. E-commerce is also increasing as a percentage of retail sales, expected to reach 41% of sales, up from 18% in 2017, according to the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nBut there's something else entirely that makes Amazon stand out right now, and that's generative artificial intelligence (AI). Really, it starts with Amazon Web Services, (AWS), Amazon's cloud computing business. AWS is growing faster than e-commerce, and it's a higher-margin business. In the third quarter, sales increased 19% year over year, accounting for 17% of sales and 62% of operating income.\n\nMany of the most valuable generative AI solutions are available to AWS customers, who can tap into all kinds of data and tools to create or benefit from AI. CEO Andy Jassy keeps saying things like it's a \"once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity\" and that it's already a billion-dollar run rate business.\n\nThere could be many factors to add in Amazon's favor, but another important one is its growing advertising business, or better framed, its constant innovations that lead to new businesses and sales-generating opportunities.\n\nThe case for Costco: Steady and reliable\n\nYou might say Costco is the very opposite of Amazon. As much as Amazon jumps from here to there, catching onto the flavor of the week, Costco is steadfast.\n\nThat's not completely true; every company has to shift to meet changing needs, and Costco's doing a fabulous job at staying the course with what it does best while embracing new opportunities to create more value for shoppers and shareholders. It offers self-checkout counters for quicker shopping, and it's been experimenting with the best way to integrate e-commerce into its platform. For example, it offers store pickup for many items, a service Amazon can't offer. It also allows customers to check store inventory for many products. In the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 24), e-commerce sales increased 13% over last year. Traffic, order value, and conversion rates all increased year over year.\n\nCostco also releases monthly results, and e-commerce picked up even more, 34% year over year. Management says that was due to Thanksgiving-related sales happening a week later than last year, but it was a strong result nontheless.\n\nBut Costco is dependable because it has a reliable membership model that customers love. You might say that Costco's main business isn't selling products but selling memberships. Paid households increased 7.6% year over year to more than 77 million in Q1, and membership fee income increased 7.8% to $1.2 billion. Renewal rates were high, as usual, at 92.8% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide.\n\nCostco also pays a dividend, which has a low yield of 0.48% at the current price. But it also pays an attractive special dividend occasionally that was $15 in 2023.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nNeither of these stocks is cheap, but Costco is more expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55 vs. 47 for Amazon.That makes it harder to call Costco a better value.\n\nFor most investors, Amazon is going to be the better buy. It's growing faster and has more opportunities. However, investors who are looking for a solid, reliable stock and passive income, like a retiree, might choose Costco instead.",

            "content": "By Lizzie Ramirez \u2014 For the fifth year in a row, Amazon is the leading employer with the most recipients on Medicaid in Nevada.\n\nThere were 18,093 Amazon employees and their dependents who were on Medicaid, a government-funded insurance program serving people with low incomes, during the fiscal year that ended in mid-2024. The number of Amazon-linked beneficiaries has climbed since 2019, the year before it took the number one spot from Walmart \u2014 which is now second after Amazon.\n\nThe total now is more than twice the number in 2019, when there were 7,892 Medicaid beneficiaries with links to Amazon. The retail giant did not say how many employees it has in Nevada.\n\nThe findings are part of a new analysis published by the state that determined more than $1.1 billion in public funds last fiscal year went to support Medicaid benefits for people working for companies with 50 or more employees in Nevada. It includes employees who made wages that were at least equivalent to working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage of $10.25 an hour.\n\nCritics have pointed to the report, required annually by a bill passed by the Nevada Legislature in 2017, as evidence that large, profitable companies are being subsidized by taxpayer funds. But according to an Amazon spokesperson, there are \u201ca ton of nuances\u201d and \u201clots of reasons why people would be on Medicaid, not just because of income.\n\nMedicaid coverage typically applies to people with household incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but pregnant women, children and people with disabilities can also qualify.\n\nFederal law doesn\u2019t exclude employed individuals from Medicaid if they meet the requirements, including having a low income, and doesn\u2019t require them to leave Medicaid even if they are eligible for affordable health insurance from their employer. Amazon also has part-time employees and flex employees who \u201cqualify for Medicaid as opposed to full time employees.\u201d\n\nFlex employees are people who help deliver Amazon packages using their own vehicles rather than the company\u2019s. Despite part-time and flex workers having access to Amazon\u2019s health insurance, it may not be as \u201cbeneficial\u201d because Medicaid is free and there\u2019s \u201cthat incentive for them to apply.\u201d\n\nHowever, Erika Washington, executive director for the progressive workers\u2019 rights organization Make it Work Nevada, says Amazon is incentivizing its employees to help the company have \u201clarger revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to insurance, there\u2019s a front end cost that the employees pay and then there\u2019s a back end cost that the employers pay,\u201d Washington said. \u201cIf they\u2019re [Amazon] not having to pay that back end cost, then it sounds like they\u2019re saving money.\u201d\n\nWashington says big corporations such as Amazon should be ashamed of themselves, noting that some hospitals and doctors don\u2019t accept Medicaid.\n\nWashington empathizes that health insurance is expensive, but believes big companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Clark County School District (CCSD) should offer employment at livable wages that includes full benefits for their employees and families.\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson said full-time employees wouldn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because they make $18 an hour in Nevada. That means full-time employees make about $3,117 per month, or $37,404 a year, \u201clikely disqualifying them from SNAP or Medicaid.\u201d\n\nFor Nevadans to qualify for Medicaid, households would need to have an annual income up to the 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 $16,753 per year for an individual or $34,638 per year for a family of four.\n\nA key finding in the analysis is that the cost of providing Medicaid to people employed by companies with 50 or more employees went down in 2023 by 22.8 percent and the cost of each member declined by 23.6 percent. That\u2019s likely because many Nevadans lost their Medicaid coverage through a process known as \u201credetermination\u201d during the fiscal year reflected in the report.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, it was mandated that the state keep individuals on Medicaid even if their income went up and they no longer qualified for it; more frequent eligibility checks that disqualified some beneficiaries resumed in 2023. The report still reflects people who had Medicaid coverage at some point in the fiscal year, even if they were later removed from the rolls and expected to find other health insurance.\n\nWalmart and CCSD are far behind Amazon. Walmart had 9,279 recipients on Medicaid and CCSD had 7,476 recipients.\n\nCCSD has about 44,000 employees who are full-time, part-time or substitute/temporary employees. Nearly 36,000 employees are eligible for group insurance coverage with CCSD for full-time and part-time employees.\n\nCCSD told The Nevada Independent \u201cwe strive to ensure that employees have access to reliable health benefits.\u201d\n\nWalmart did not provide comment on the report\u2019s findings or say how many employees it has in Nevada.\n\n\u2014 This story is used with permission of The Nevada Independent.

Now, if only you had one of your own to hibernate inside and watch the snow fall all winter long. Well, as it turns out, Amazon is selling that very fantasy (in a way) with an all-wood, 108-square-foot cabin that will let you live out your hygge dreams. And it costs less than $10,000.\n\nAllwood Escape Tiny Cabin\n\nAmazon\n\nThe seller, Allwood, is a Florida-based supplier that imports tiny home-building kits primarily from Scandinavia and the Baltic States, according to the website. This particular Escape Cabin embodies quality and minimalism with a wide-open plan and double tongue-and-groove building pattern. Measuring about 12 feet wide and 9 feet deep, the off-grid cabin is made of real Nordic spruce at a standard thickness of 1.75 inches. You have to add your own insulation and heat to make it winter-proof.\n\nAmazon\n\nReviewers who have tried the home themselves say it\u2019s a great starter kit, ripe for electric, interior walls, and plumbing. Allwood even sells additional wall planks and an exterior awning (currently unavailable) as optional add-ons. The house already comes with a door, window, and covered entrance, as the gabled roof extends about four feet past the front wall.\n\nAt the Allwood website, several people reviewed this cabin, with customers using it as a home office, a \u201cshe shed,\u201d and even an island escape. \u201cWe wanted to have a little bunkhouse/shed on Frye Island, Maine. After a bit of research and some excellent customer service from Robin, we decided on the Escape,\u201d wrote one person. \u201cIt was the right size, was awfully cute and had an overhang perfect for sheltering us from a little drizzle.\u201d\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen it comes to assembly, the website says that it will take at least two people and about three days of work \u2014 you are constructing a house, after all! One Amazon reviewer also cautioned that you may need to buy extra materials, such as a base for the cabin, roofing tiles, and weather stain or paint.\n\nOut of 450 people who have rated the company on Amazon, about 350 have given Allwood five stars. Read on for more Allwood cabins to fuel your hygge dreams, including one that\u2019s four times the size of the Escape.\n\nAllwood Arlanda XL Cabin\n\nAmazon\n\nMore of a boxy mid-century modern design, the Arlanda XL cabin measures 227 square feet and comes with an interior wall you can put wherever you want. The tall picture windows are a highlight, letting natural light in and offering superior views of the winter scenery outside. The vertical layout of the wooden panels and flat roof add to the contemporary aesthetic.\n\nAllwood Timberline Cabin\n\nAmazon\n\nOne of Allwood\u2019s largest cabins on offer, the Timberline measures 483 square feet and has space for three rooms \u2014 as in, a living room, bedroom, and bathroom \u2014 plus a 129-square-foot loft. The traditional gabled roof extends over a 5-by-23-foot front porch, creating the picture of bucolic comfort.\n\nLove a great deal?

            "content": "This post is co-written by Nicholas Dentandt, Senior software engineer and Team lead at Orca Security.\n\nOrca Security, an AWS Partner, is an independent cybersecurity software provider whose patented agentless-first cloud security platform is trusted by hundreds of enterprises globally. Orca makes cloud security simple for enterprises moving to and scaling with AWS with its patented SideScanning technology and Unified Data Model.\n\nAt Orca Security, we use a variety of metrics to assess the significance of security alerts on cloud assets. For example, a vulnerability on an asset that isn\u2019t exposed to the internet might pose minimal risk, but the same vulnerability on a publicly accessible machine could demand immediate attention. Our Amazon Neptune database plays a critical role in calculating the exposure of individual assets within a customer\u2019s cloud environment. By building a graph that maps assets and their connectivity between one another and to the broader internet, the Orca Cloud Security Platform can evaluate both how an asset is exposed as well as how an attacker could potentially move laterally within an account.\n\nTo better understand how our system works and where Amazon Neptune fits in, let\u2019s take a look at our overall architecture:\n\nAs shown in the diagram, our system consists of several key components. Orca collectors gather data from our customers\u2019 cloud environments and write/update information in our Amazon Neptune database. Our collectors query APIs made available by cloud providers. We process that data to produce a graph of connectivity between different types of assets and the internet. We store these complex relationships between cloud assets in Amazon Neptune. The Orca findings component reads this data from Amazon Neptune to generate security insights, which are then presented to our customers in an easy-to-understand format through Orca Dashboards. This architecture allows us to efficiently collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse cloud environments, with the Amazon Neptune database being crucial for storing and querying the complex relationships between cloud assets \u2013 a key component for our security analysis. The data in the graph is used to generate exposure values for each asset, which is then combined with security findings to better highlight the urgency and importance of a security alert. In the following sections, we explore how we\u2019ve optimized our use of Amazon Neptune to handle the scale and complexity of this data effectively.\n\nThe topology of our customers\u2019 cloud environments varies greatly, requiring us to implement several techniques to achieve optimal performance of Amazon Neptune. These optimizations are crucial both during the graph-building process and when running customer queries through our API\u2014particularly shortest path queries between two nodes. In this post, we explore some of the key strategies we\u2019ve adopted to maximize the performance of our Amazon Neptune database.\n\nBatching and caching: Minimizing overhead and speeding up inserts\n\nBefore diving into specific optimizations, it\u2019s crucial to emphasize the importance of data modeling in graph databases. A well-designed data model is the foundation for efficient queries and scalable applications. Poor data modeling can lead to complex, slow-performing queries, regardless of other optimizations.\n\nOne impactful performance optimization we\u2019ve implemented is the use of batching and caching mechanisms during data insert operations. Amazon Neptune, like most databases, performs best when handling large operations in bulk rather than processing many small, individual insertions.\n\nBatching layer\n\nWe implemented this optimization by designing a batching layer that groups inserts into bulk operations. Our solution utilizes the Gremlin query language, which is well-suited for graph database operations. Rather than inserting each node or edge immediately, records are collected and processed after a target batch size is reached. This bulk insert approach significantly reduces the communication overhead between our application and the Amazon Neptune database, leading to a marked improvement in performance. We use programmatic insertion with Gremlin queries such as g.addV() for vertices and g.addE() for edges in these bulk operations. This approach gives us more fine-grained control over the insertion process while still benefiting from the performance gains of batching.\n\nOne challenge we faced in this approach was maintaining the integrity of edges in the graph. Because nodes must exist before edges can connect them, our logic makes sure nodes are always inserted when the edge batch reaches the target size. By guaranteeing that nodes are present in the database before edges are created, we maintain data consistency while still reaping the benefits of batching.\n\nMulti-tenancy: Partition strategy optimization\n\nIn our multi-tenant environment, we leverage Gremlin\u2019s PartitionStrategy, which is supported by Amazon Neptune, to effectively segregate customer data. While the implementation is relatively straightforward, leveraging Gremlin\u2019s PartitionStrategy to tag each node and edge with a property identifying its \u201cpartition\u201d, we discovered some valuable optimizations during our journey. For readers interested in implementing multi-tenant graphs with Amazon Neptune, we recommend reviewing AWS Prescriptive Guidance Multi-tenancy guidance for ISVs running Amazon Neptune databases.\n\nA key learning emerged when we implemented custom pagination across partitioned data. Initially, we used simple numeric page attributes (such as \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d) across all partitions. However, we found that querying these common values across multiple partitions led to significant performance issues, as the same value existed in multiple partitions.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine we have three partitions: \u201cCustomerA\u201d, \u201cCustomerB\u201d, and \u201cCustomerC\u201d. With our initial approach, each partition would have pages numbered \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and so on. When querying for page \u201c1\u201d across all partitions, the database would need to search through every partition, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.\n\nTo address this, we modified our approach by prepending the partition key to these values. For example:\n\nCustomerA\u2019s pages: \u201cCustomerA-1\u201d, \u201cCustomerA-2\u201d, \u201cCustomerA-3\u201d\n\nCustomerB\u2019s pages: \u201cCustomerB-1\u201d, \u201cCustomerB-2\u201d, \u201cCustomerB-3\u201d\n\nCustomerC\u2019s pages: \u201cCustomerC-1\u201d, \u201cCustomerC-2\u201d, \u201cCustomerC-3\u201d\n\nThis simple change ensured value uniqueness across partitions. Now, when querying for a specific page, like \u201cCustomerB-2\u201d, the database can quickly locate the exact partition and page, resulting in substantial performance improvements for our cross-partition queries. This optimization demonstrates how even small adjustments to data modeling in a partitioned environment can have significant performance implications.\n\nCaching layer\n\nIn addition to batching, we introduced an in-memory caching layer to further improve performance during the graph building process. After nodes are inserted into Amazon Neptune, they\u2019re stored in a least recently used (LRU) cache along with their IDs. This caching layer isn\u2019t a separate service but rather an in-memory data structure that exists only for the duration of the graph building process for a single customer\u2019s cloud environment.\n\nBy caching the recently inserted nodes and their IDs, we can bypass querying Amazon Neptune for them when building the graph, which would otherwise require costly database read operations. Instead, by retrieving nodes directly from the in-memory cache, we can respond to queries almost instantaneously. This optimization is particularly useful during the graph building process, where large numbers of related nodes are being inserted or queried in rapid succession.\n\nThe caching layer implementation works as follows: any time a new node is added to Amazon Neptune, the node itself and its ID are also added to the LRU cache. When building the graph, the process first checks the cache for the required nodes. If the nodes are found in the cache, they are retrieved directly from memory, avoiding the need for a database read operation. If the nodes aren\u2019t in the cache, they\u2019re fetched from Amazon Neptune and added to the cache for subsequent lookups.\n\nBy using an in-memory LRU cache, we can take advantage of temporal locality and serve node data from a faster memory cache, significantly reducing the overhead of repeated database reads during the graph building process for each customer\u2019s cloud environment.\n\nConcurrent in/out queries: Reducing query response time\n\nAnother critical optimization we implemented was the use of concurrent inbound and outbound queries for our API path queries. This technique addresses a key challenge in our system: efficiently traversing graphs with widely varying structures across different customers. By running queries in both directions simultaneously, we can adapt to each customer\u2019s unique graph topology and significantly reduce query response times.\n\nParallel query execution\n\nIn a typical API path query, the application needs to explore the graph by traversing nodes and edges in a particular direction. However, we observed that customers often have widely different graph configurations\u2014some with highly interconnected internal structures and others with numerous external inbound paths. The traversal method that works best for one structure may be suboptimal for another.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following diagram:\n\nWe use a breadth-first search algorithm for our graph traversal. If we were looking for paths between Ext Network 2 and EC2 Instance 1, starting the search from Ext Network 2 would require exploring all the additional branches in the dense internal network to arrive at the result. However, if we start our query at EC2 Instance 1, there is less density, so we only need to explore a single path to find the valid connection.\n\nThe performance improvements are even more significant for queries that do not have a path. Imagine searching through a very dense graph only to discover there are no paths at all, versus querying from the target node and immediately finding it has no inbound edges.\n\nTo overcome this variability, we run queries in both directions (inbound and outbound) concurrently and return the result from whichever query finishes first. This approach makes sure we always get the fastest possible response, regardless of the specific graph structure involved. By using parallelism, we\u2019re able to drastically reduce the query response time for our API endpoints, making the system more efficient and responsive to diverse graph topologies.\n\nData modeling: Minimizing nodes and edges for optimal performance\n\nEfficient data modeling plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance of a graph database. It\u2019s important to understand that if you get the data model wrong, it can be extremely challenging to write efficient queries, regardless of other optimizations. Performance in graph databases is a product of both the data model and well-written queries.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you\u2019re modeling a social network. A naive approach might create a direct connection between every user and all of their friends. While this seems intuitive, it can lead to performance issues as the number of users and connections grows. A more efficient model might use intermediate nodes to represent friend groups or interests, reducing the total number of edges and making queries more manageable.\n\nGraph models with excessive numbers of nodes and edges can quickly lead to performance bottlenecks during queries, especially when traversing complex relationships. Our team focused on creating a streamlined data model that reduces unnecessary complexity while maintaining accuracy in representing relationships. This approach not only improves query performance but also enhances the scalability and maintainability of the entire system.\n\nCase study: Load balancer modeling\n\nA prime example of this optimization is how we model load balancers in our graph. Initially, we faced the challenge of representing load balancers and their connections to a potentially large number of targets. A naive approach would be to directly connect every load balancer node to every target, resulting in an explosion of edges.\n\nInstead, we opted for a more efficient data model that better represents the underlying assets. For instance, when two load balancers reference the same auto scaling group in their target group, rather than duplicating the connections, we separate the auto scaling group as its own node. The load balancers\u2019 backend nodes then connect directly to the auto scaling group, allowing us to reuse the existing relationships between the auto scaling group and the instances it manages. This also provides users with a clearer view of how their assets are exposed.\n\nAlthough this approach involves creating additional nodes for each load balancer, it dramatically reduces the number of edges within the graph. By keeping query paths streamlined and more efficient, we achieve a graph model that remains lightweight, scalable, and significantly less costly in terms of query execution. This balance between node creation and edge reduction makes sure our Amazon Neptune database performs optimally, even with highly complex cloud architectures.\n\nThe following diagram compares the modeling process without splitting components and the improved data modeling process.\n\nModeling without splitting components:\n\nImproved modeling:\n\nConclusion\n\nThrough the application of batching, caching, concurrent query execution, and efficient data modeling, we have optimized the performance of our Amazon Neptune database, delivering faster response times and reducing operational overhead. These optimizations allow us to scale effectively while handling the diverse graph structures of our customers. By continuing to refine these techniques and explore new ways to improve database efficiency, we make sure our application remains robust and performant in the face of growing data demands.\n\nLet us know your thoughts or share your own experiences with optimizing graph databases in the comments.

The Health Benefits Connector matches people to digital health companies outside of Amazon that are covered by their employer. Amazon has been building this program over the last year, also offering access to Hinge Health for musculoskeletal care, Rula and Talkspace for mental health support, and Omada for diabetes treatment.\n\nAmazon customers eligible for Teladoc Health\u2019s services in diabetes, hypertension, pre-diabetes and weight management can now enroll directly through the Health Benefits Connector. When customers search for products related to cardiometabolic conditions on Amazon, the company will promote Teladoc Health\u2019s services. Amazon verifies whether the consumer\u2019s insurance plan covers the digital health program using details like their legal name, date of birth, employer name and insurance carrier.\n\nThrough Teladoc Health\u2019s cardiometabolic programs, patients gain access to a care team (which includes providers, coaches, registered dietitians, mental health coaches and emergency response specialists). They can also track their physical and mental health via the Teladoc Health app.\n\n\u201cThis [partnership] is around finding new and different ways to engage people in our products and services.

            "content": "In late December, while Amazon workers were striking across the country, Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment (CAUSE), a union of Amazon workers at the company\u2019s RDU1 warehouse in Garner, North Carolina, filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). If the election is successful, they will be the second unionized Amazon warehouse in the country and the first in a right-to-work state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surreal moment,\u201d says the Reverend Ryan Brown, president of CAUSE. \u201cI knew that we would get to this stage, that\u2019s why we poured our hearts and souls into organizing our coworkers for so long. At the same time, I\u2019m always looking ahead and there\u2019s still so much fight left.\u201d In December, Brown was terminated from his position at RDU1 for allegedly making racist remarks, though Brown contends that he was fired in retaliation to union activity. Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, writes in an email that Brown was terminated \u201cfor repeated misconduct that included making derogatory and racist comments to his co-workers.\u201d In spite of his termination, Brown has continued organizing with CAUSE.\n\nMuch like the New York-based Amazon Labor Union, which, in 2022, became the first NLRB-recognized union at Amazon, CAUSE\u2019s origins trace back to workers\u2019 concerns about COVID-19 and feelings that the company was not prioritizing their health. After much reflection and prayer, Brown came to the conclusion that he needed to organize. He reached out to Mary \u201cMa Mary\u201d Hill, a packer at Amazon since 2020, and began this monumental project. \u201cWe had a petition and we started asking our coworkers what things really, really got under their skin about working at Amazon,\u201d says Hill. \u201cAnd we found some common threads that, no matter what department you worked in, we all didn't like.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Expand CAUSE CAUSE Leaders Reverend Ryan Brown and Mary \"Ma Mary\" Hill sign the first union cards at the dining room table in September 2024.\n\nOne of the top concerns for CAUSE organizers is Amazon\u2019s disregard for worker health and safety at its warehouses, which U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Commission for Health, Safety, Labor, and Pensions, highlighted in a major report last month. Among the report\u2019s findings was that \u201cAmazon forces workers to move in unsafe ways and to repeat the same movements hundreds and thousands of times each shift, resulting in extremely high rates of musculoskeletal disorders.\u201d RDU1 workers were among those included in Sanders\u2019s report. \u201cNothing in [the report] is shocking to me,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI have scars. I know what goes on behind those walls.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s report also found that Amazon makes its \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for workers with disabilities to receive accommodations. RDU1 worker and CAUSE organizer Shancia Highsmith, who previously received accommodations for a health condition, says, \u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of time to be on [accommodations] because they really don\u2019t respect us when it comes to accommodations or anything like that. Some people [coworkers] say they\u2019re trying to get accommodations. They got all the proof, but they still get denied.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people who need accommodations are almost begging and [Amazon] tries to evade giving accommodation in a thousand ways,\u201d says Roberta, a worker at RDU1 who asked that her real name not be used because of concerns about retaliation.\n\nA contributing factor to ongoing safety concerns is the fact that while many workers at RDU1 speak Spanish as their first language, Amazon does not provide safety training in any languages other than English, according to Roberta. \u201cHow are you going to absorb all of this information about what is flammable and what isn\u2019t, the icons related to hazmat or dangerous substances, and other things that I don\u2019t understand clearly because they gave the training [only] in English?\u201d says Roberta.\n\nIn addition to the lack of Spanish language trainings, none of the safety officers who patrol the warehouse speak Spanish, making it difficult for Spanish-speaking workers to report injuries or safety concerns. According to Roberta, although managers will frequently talk about workplace safety, the standards are rarely put into practice. \u201cWhen you start your shift,\u201d Roberta says, \u201cthey [management] ask you questions, like a survey about safety, and the manager at the beginning always emphasizes the safety shoes, to put on your gloves, to avoid certain [dangerous] movements and stuff, but that\u2019s a total facade. The people who are in charge of safety, who walk through the aisles putting on a show that they\u2019re monitoring safety\u2014they\u2019re not. They don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d\n\nRDU1 workers are also concerned about the high productivity standards expected during peak season, which lasts from Amazon\u2019s annual Prime Day in October through the December holidays. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in a prison,\u201d says Roberta. \u201cLife becomes completely void. All you do is go to work before the sun even comes up, spend the whole day on your feet in there. When you leave, it\u2019s dark already. You go home to rest, then it keeps repeating. [Overtime] should not be compulsory. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Expand CAUSE A CAUSE canvaser approaches the RDU1 warehouse in Garner, North Carolina during the morning shift change.\n\nLike the workers at New York City\u2019s unionized JFK8 warehouse, CAUSE organizers report experiencing disrespectful treatment by Amazon and its managers. \u201cWe\u2019re not treated fairly,\u201d says Hill. \u201cHalf of the managers talk to you like you\u2019re a piece of garbage on the floor. Like you\u2019re not human. If [they] considered us as more than just robots, [they] would think about that and treat us accordingly.\u201d\n\nIn response to their unionization efforts, CAUSE organizers say Amazon has been providing them with tokens of appreciation in order to quell enthusiasm for the union. \u201c Instead of giving us a raise or making our working conditions better, they constantly try to replace that with little treats,\u201d says CAUSE organizer and Amazon worker Ava Evelyn. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to coerce the employees into thinking, \u2018Oh, Amazon is so good to us for giving you a biscuit.\u2019 \u201d Examples of these \u201ctreats\u201d include biscuits from Bojangles (a North Carolina fast food chain), tickets to the state fair, and DJ sets of music played during work. Amazon has also been accused by union organizers and the NLRB of engaging in union busting. Members of CAUSE expect to see more pushback from Amazon now that they have filed for a union election. \u201cYou\u2019re about to see a side of Amazon now that you really never knew existed,\u201d says Brown. In November of 2024, three CAUSE members were arrested at RDU1 while distributing food to workers who were struggling during the holiday season and collecting union cards. Brown only expects Amazon\u2019s pushback to ramp up, but that hasn\u2019t deterred him or other CAUSE leaders.\n\nAmazon did not reply by publication time to a request for comment regarding the treatment described in this story by the workers at RDU1.\n\nOn January 7, CAUSE was informed that the card collection campaign had been successful, meaning CAUSE collected signed union election cards from at least 30 percent of eligible union members in their workplace. Workers will vote on whether to unionize in an election scheduled to take place February 10 to 15, 2025.\n\n\u201cWe woke up,\u201d says Hill. \u201cSome of us have been asleep for a little while, but we\u2019re wide awake now. We know what real power is. You might be in charge, but we have the power.\u201d",

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.\n\nMuch of Amazon\u2019s experimentation in the Kindle line has generally led to bigger devices that are easier to read, but the Kindle Colorsoft is the first that ventures beyond a fully monochromatic viewing experience. Of course, that comes with a higher price tag than comparably sized Kindles, but if you\u2019re a Prime member, you can finally save a bit. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition has dropped to $229.99 ($50 off) at Amazon in its first sale.\n\nWe feel the Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s 7-inch display offers the best color available in an ebook reader yet, thanks to better-than-average vividity and contrast. It makes browsing and reading books more pleasant, if nothing else. But there are other improvements we like, such as faster page-turning performance and smoother zooming. Those benefits aren\u2019t necessarily exclusive to the Colorsoft, however, as all of Amazon\u2019s newer Kindles have achieved similar results, thanks to performance bumps and software updates. This includes the 2024 Kindle Paperwhite, which the Colorsoft takes its design cues from.\n\nBut like most newer Kindles, it\u2019s still lacking physical page turn buttons. That\u2019s a bit of a damper for something that costs considerably more and has a display that needs to be kept pristine. And while the color is great, the display\u2019s maximum 300ppi resolution is halved when using it \u2014 something to keep in mind, especially if you already have trouble reading standard text sizes on the Kindle\u2019s display at full resolution. Its advertised eight-week battery life also falls short of the 12 weeks you can squeeze out of the Paperwhite. That\u2019s still plenty, though, and you have convenient charging options between USB-C and wireless (the latter requires a separately sold $39.99 dock).\n\nFinally, before you decide whether to purchase one, it\u2019s worth noting that early Kindle Colorsoft units suffered from a display issue that caused yellow discoloration. Amazon says it has since addressed the issue with a combination of hardware and software tweaks. It even halted shipments temporarily while it investigated the issue and has allowed buyers to refund or replace their devices. If you buy one and happen to encounter the defect, Amazon should provide a remedy without much fuss.\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we\u2019ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "Amazon is starting to pack and deliver groceries for customers in Spain using bio-based bags made from vegetable materials produced in Europe, including corn starch and vegetable oils, which can one day be recycled into new bags. The first trials of the new bags, developed by materials experts at Italian company Novamont, part of Versalis (Eni), with support from materials scientists at Amazon, are being piloted for Amazon Fresh orders in Valencia.\n\nFood safe, strong and weather-resistant\n\nAmazon\u2019s bio-based bags are durable, food safe and weather-resistant. Because they are safe for food, this new material (Mater-biTM) could progressively replace fossil-based plastics used by food retailers and manufacturers. Their biodegradability also means they do not generate any microplastics.\n\n\u201cOur new Amazon Fresh bio-based bags provide protection against spills and condensation to keep grocery orders safe for our customers, and at the same time are less impactful for the planet because they are made from renewable, food safe materials derived from plants, like corn starch and vegetable oils,\u201d said Alan Jacobsen, Amazon's Materials & Energy Sciences Director. \u201cUnlike most petroleum-based plastic bags, these materials have the potential to be more efficiently recycled, while also being able to naturally degrade in a composting environment.\u201d\n\nRight now, Amazon Fresh bio-based material bags handed back to drivers in Valencia can be mechanically recycled \u2013 which means the material can be turned into pellets by local recycling partners, and given to Novamont to make new bags once again.\n\n\u201cExperimenting with Amazon is an exceptional opportunity to showcase packaging solutions made from our family of Mater-Bi materials, all of which are biodegradable and compostable, and wholly or partly derived from biomass,\u201d said Catia Bastioli, CEO of Novamont (Versalis, Eni). \u201cThis is a unique opportunity to test their effectiveness and multiple recycling options in terms of resource regeneration and certified environmental performance.\"\n\nAlready, the majority (75%) of Amazon customers in Valencia who have received the bio-based bags say they are pleased with the new packaging. Respondents say they like the new bags because they are biodegradable and bio-based, or because they can reuse them for other purposes.\n\nAmazon will use the results of this trial to assess whether these new bio-based bags can be used on a broader scale.\n\nHow Amazon is working to \u2018close the loop\u2019\n\nIn parallel to the Amazon Fresh and Novamont pilot in Valencia, Amazon\u2019s research scientists are also working with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s BOTTLE Consortium led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to develop a new low-temperature recycling process to recycle bio-based, biodegradable materials.\n\n\u201cThis process breaks down bio-based, biodegradable materials into basic building blocks that can be repolymerised back into new materials without degrading the material properties,\u201d Jacobsen added. \u201cInstead of only having composting as an end-of-life solution for these materials, this new process enables biodegradable plastics to be efficiently recycled, keeping these materials in use and reducing the need for additional raw materials.\u201d\n\nThe start-up EsterCycle \u2013 which uses technology developed by NREL and Amazon - has the goal of scaling this new technology beyond the lab, enabling bio-based, biodegradable plastics to be more widely recycled.\n\nDelivery bags today, food containers tomorrow\n\nThe next-generation of bio-based and biodegradable materials in the packaging sector, especially in the food and grocery industry, can enable a faster transition to a circular economy, helping to avoid millions of tons of plastic food and drink packaging. To improve the resource efficiency and circularity of the packaging sector, Amazon and Novamont are developing and testing various food safe bio-based solutions for advanced packaging applications, such as yoghurt cups, coffee pods and containers for fruit and meats, in a project co-financed by Circular Biobased Europe.\n\nPackaging with a lower environmental impact\n\nAs well as developing and testing next-generation packaging which is safe and circular by design, Amazon is committed to reducing packaging wherever possible. This has resulted in more than 1 billion of our shipments since 2019 being delivered without any added delivery packaging at all in Europe through a programme called Ships In Product Packaging. Since 2015, our packaging reduction programmes have enabled us to avoid more than 3 million metric tons of packaging materials.\n\nWhen additional Amazon packaging is required to ship a product, we use paper-based packaging that can be easily recycled in customers\u2019 household recycling. In Europe, all of our delivery packaging\u2014the boxes, bags and envelopes that we pack products in to deliver to our customers\u2014is recyclable. This includes delivery packaging for items sold directly by Amazon, and by third-party selling partners that use Fulfilment by Amazon.",

You will learn how to configure Amazon Q Business and ServiceNow, how to create a generative AI plugin for your ServiceNow incidents, and how to test and interact with ServiceNow using the Amazon Q Business web experience. By the end of this post, you will be able to enhance your ServiceNow experience with Amazon Q Business and enjoy the benefits of a generative AI\u2013powered interface.\n\nSolution overview\n\nAmazon Q Business has three main components: a front-end chat interface, a data source connector and retriever, and a ServiceNow plugin. Amazon Q Business uses AWS Secrets Manager secrets to store the ServiceNow credentials securely. The following diagram shows the architecture for the solution.\n\nChat\n\nUsers interact with ServiceNow through the generative AI\u2013powered chat interface using natural language.\n\nData source connector and retriever\n\nA data source connector is a mechanism for integrating and synchronizing data from multiple repositories into one container index. Amazon Q Business has two types of retrievers: native retrievers and existing retrievers using Amazon Kendra. The native retrievers support a wide range of Amazon Q Business connectors, including ServiceNow. The existing retriever option is for those who already have an Amazon Kendra retriever and would like to use that for their Amazon Q Business application. For the ServiceNow integration, we use the native retriever.\n\nServiceNow plugin\n\nAmazon Q Business provides a plugin feature for performing actions such as creating incidents in ServiceNow.\n\nThe following high-level steps show how to configure the Amazon Q Business \u2013 ServiceNow integration:\n\nCreate a user in ServiceNow for Amazon Q Business to communicate with ServiceNow Create knowledge base articles in ServiceNow if they do not exist already Create an Amazon Q Business application and configure the ServiceNow data source and retriever in Amazon Q Business Synchronize the data source Create a ServiceNow plugin in Amazon Q Business\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo run this application, you must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, and a user that can create and manage the required resources. If you are not an AWS account holder, see How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?\n\nYou need an AWS IAM Identity Center set up in the AWS Organizations organizational unit (OU) or AWS account in which you are building the Amazon Q Business application. You should have a user or group created in IAM Identity Center. You will assign this user or group to the Amazon Q Business application during the application creation process. For guidance, refer to Manage identities in IAM Identity Center.\n\nYou also need a ServiceNow user with incident_manager and knowledge_admin permissions to create and view knowledge base articles and to create incidents. We use a developer instance of ServiceNow for this post as an example. You can find out how to get the developer instance in Personal Developer Instances.\n\nSolution walkthrough\n\nTo integrate ServiceNow and Amazon Q Business, use the steps in the following sections.\n\nCreate a knowledge base article\n\nFollow these steps to create a knowledge base article:\n\nSign in to ServiceNow and navigate to Self-Service > Knowledge Choose Create an Article On the Create new article page, select a knowledge base and choose a category. Optionally, you may create a new category. Provide a Short description and type in the Article body Choose Submit to create the article, as shown in the following screenshot\n\nRepeat these steps to create a couple of knowledge base articles. In this example, we created a hypothetical enterprise named Example Corp for demonstration purposes.\n\nCreate an Amazon Q Business application\n\nAmazon Q offers three subscription plans: Amazon Q Business Lite, Amazon Q Business Pro, and Amazon Q Developer Pro. Read the Amazon Q Documentation for more details. For this example, we used Amazon Q Business Lite.\n\nCreate application\n\nFollow these steps to create an application:\n\nIn the Amazon Q Business console, choose Get started, then choose Create application to create a new Amazon Q Business application, as shown in the following screenshot\n\nName your application in Application name. In Service access, select Create and use a new service-linked role (SLR). For more information about example service roles, see IAM roles for Amazon Q Business. For information on service-linked roles, including how to manage them, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon Q Business. We named our application ServiceNow-Helpdesk. Next, select Create, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nChoose a retriever and index provisioning\n\nTo choose a retriever and index provisioning, follow these steps in the Select retriever screen, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nFor Retrievers, select Use native retriever For Index provisioning, choose Starter Choose Next\n\nConnect data sources\n\nAmazon Q Business has ready-made connectors for common data sources and business systems.\n\nEnter \u201cServiceNow\u201d to search and select ServiceNow Online as the data source, as shown in the following screenshot\n\nEnter the URL and the version of your ServiceNow instance. We used the ServiceNow version Vancouver for this post.\n\nScroll down the page to provide additional details about the data source. Under Authentication, select Basic authentication. Under AWS Secrets Manager secret, select Create and add a new secret from the dropdown menu as shown in the screenshot.\n\nProvide the Username and Password you created in ServiceNow to create an AWS Secrets Manager secret. Choose Save.\n\nUnder Configure VPC and security group, keep the setting as No VPC because you will be connecting to the ServiceNow by the internet. You may choose to create a new service role under IAM role. This will create a role specifically for this application.\n\nIn the example, we synchronize the ServiceNow knowledge base articles and incidents. Provide the information as shown in the following image below. Notice that for Filter query the example shows the following code.\n\nworkflow_state=published^kb_knowledge_base=dfc19531bf2021003f07e2c1ac0739ab^article_type=text^active=true^EQ\n\nThis filter query aims to sync the articles that meet the following criteria:\n\nworkflow_state = published\n\nkb_knowledge_base = dfc19531bf2021003f07e2c1ac0739ab (This is the default Sys ID for the knowledge base named \u201cKnowledge\u201d in ServiceNow).\n\nType = text (This field contains the text in the Knowledge article).\n\nActive = true (This field filters the articles to sync only the ones that are active).\n\nThe filter fields are separated by ^, and the end of the query is represented by EQ. You can find more details about the Filter query and other parameters in Connecting Amazon Q Business to ServiceNow Online using the console.\n\nProvide the Sync scope for the Incidents, as shown in the following screenshot\n\nYou may select Full sync initially so that a complete synchronization is performed. You need to select the frequency of the synchronization as well. For this post, we chose Run on demand. If you need to keep the knowledge base and incident data more up-to-date with the ServiceNow instance, choose a shorter window.\n\nA field mapping will be provided for you to validate. You won\u2019t be able to change the field mapping at this stage. Choose Add data source to proceed.\n\nThis completes the data source configuration for Amazon Q Business. The configuration takes a few minutes to be completed. Watch the screen for any errors and updates. Once the data source is created, you will be greeted with a message You successfully created the following data source: \u2018ServiceNow-Datasource\u2019\n\nAdd users and groups\n\nFollow these steps to add users and groups:\n\nChoose Next In the Add groups and users page, click Add groups and users. You will be presented with the option of Add and assign new users or Assign existing users and groups. Select Assign existing users and groups. Choose Next, as shown in the following image.\n\nSearch for an existing user or group in your IAM Identity Center, select one, and choose Assign. After selecting the right user or group, choose Done.\n\nThis completes the activity of assigning the user and group access to the Amazon Q Business application.\n\nCreate a web experience\n\nFollow these steps to create a web experience in the Add groups and users screen, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nChoose Create and use a new service role in the Web experience service access section Choose Create application\n\nThe deployed application with the application status will be shown in the Amazon Q Business > Applications console as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nSynchronize the data source\n\nOnce the data source is configured successfully, it\u2019s time to start the synchronization. To begin this process, the ServiceNow fields that require synchronization must be updated. Because we intend to get answers from the knowledge base content, the text field needs to be synchronized. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Amazon Q Business console, select Applications in the navigation pane Select ServiceNow-Helpdesk and then ServiceNow-Datasource Choose Actions. From the dropdown, choose Edit, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the page to the Field mappings Select text and description.\n\nChoose Update. After the update, choose Sync now.\n\nThe synchronization takes a few minutes to complete depending on the amount of data to be synchronized. Make sure that the Status is Completed, as shown in the following screenshot, before proceeding further. If you notice any error, you can choose the error hyperlink. The error hyperlink will take you to Amazon CloudWatch Logs to examining the logs for further troubleshooting.\n\nCreate ServiceNow plugin\n\nA ServiceNow plugin in Amazon Q Business helps you create incidents in ServiceNow through Amazon Q Business chat. To create one, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Amazon Q Business console, select Enhancements from the navigation pane Under Plugins, choose Add plugin, as shown in the following screenshot\n\nIn the Add Plugin page, shown in the following screenshot, and select the ServiceNow plugin\n\nProvide a Name for the plugin Enter the ServiceNow URL and use the previously created AWS Secrets Manager secret for the Authentication Select Create and use a new service role Choose Add plugin\n\nThe status of the plugin will be shown in the Plugins If Plugin status is Active, the plugin is configured and ready to use.\n\nUse the Amazon Q Business chat interface\n\nTo use the Amazon Q Business chat interface, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Amazon Q Business console, choose Applications from the navigation pane. The web experience URL will be provided for each Amazon Q Business application.\n\nChoose the Web experience URL to open the chat interface. Enter an IAM Identity Center username and password that was assigned to this application. The following screenshot shows the Sign in\n\nYou can now ask questions and receive responses, as shown in the following image. The answers will be specific to your organization and are retrieved from the knowledge base in ServiceNow.\n\nYou can ask the chat interface to create incidents as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nA new pop-up window will appear, providing additional information related to the incident. In this window, you can provide more information related to the ticket and choose Create.\n\nThis will create a ServiceNow incident using the web experience of Amazon Q Business without signing in to ServiceNow. You may verify the ticket in the ServiceNow console as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we showed how Kyndryl is using Amazon Q Business to enable natural language conversations with ServiceNow using the ServiceNow connector provided by Amazon Q Business. We also showed how to create a ServiceNow plugin that allows users to create incidents in ServiceNow directly from the Amazon Q Business chat interface.

            "content": "January 17, 2025: We updated this post to highlight the importance of using short-term credentials to mitigate the risk of unauthorized techniques such as the one detailed in this blog.\n\nAt Amazon Web Services (AWS), the security of our customers\u2019 data is our top priority, and it always will be. Recently, the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) and our automated security monitoring systems identified an increase in unusual encryption activity associated with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these actions do not take advantage of a vulnerability within an AWS service\u2014but rather require valid credentials that an unauthorized user uses in an unintended way. Although these actions occur in the customer domain of the shared responsibility model, AWS recommends steps that customers can use to prevent or reduce the impact of such activity.\n\nWorking with customers, our security teams detected an increase of data encryption events in S3 that used an encryption method known as server-side encryption using client-provided keys (SSE-C). While this is a feature used by many customers, we detected a pattern where a large number of S3 CopyObject operations using SSE-C began to overwrite objects, which has the effect of re-encrypting customer data with a new encryption key. Our analysis uncovered that this was being done by malicious actors who had obtained valid customer credentials, and were using them to re-encrypt objects.\n\nUsing active defense tools, we have implemented automatic mitigations that will help to prevent this type of unauthorized activity in many cases. These mitigations have already prevented a high percentage of attempts from succeeding, without our customers having to take steps to protect themselves. However, the threat actors used valid credentials, and it is difficult for AWS to reliably distinguish valid usage from malicious use. Therefore, we recommend that customers follow best practices to mitigate risk.\n\nWe recommend that customers implement these four security best practices to protect against the unauthorized use of SSE-C:\n\nImplement short-term credentials Implement data recovery procedures Monitor AWS resources for unexpected access patterns Block the use of SSE-C unless required by an application\n\n1. Implement short-term credentials\n\nWhile the above technique makes use of SSE-C encryption, the root cause of this and a large portion of security events is the compromise of long-term access keys. The most effective approach to mitigating the risk of compromised credentials is to never create long-term credentials in the first place. Credentials that do not exist cannot be exposed or stolen, and AWS provides a rich set of capabilities that alleviate the need to ever store credentials in source code or in configuration files.\n\nIAM roles enable applications to securely make signed API requests from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) containers, or Lambda functions by using short-term credentials. Even systems outside the AWS Cloud can make authenticated calls without long-term AWS credentials by using the IAM Roles Anywhere feature. Additionally, AWS IAM Identity Center enables developer workstations to obtain short-term credentials backed by their longer-term user identities that are protected by Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).\n\nAll of these technologies rely on the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to issue temporary security credentials that can control access to AWS resources without distributing or embedding long-term AWS security credentials within an application, whether in code or in configuration files.\n\n2. Implement data recovery procedures\n\nWithout data protection mechanisms in place, data recovery times can be longer. As a data protection best practice, we recommend that you protect against data being overwritten and that you maintain a second copy of critical data.\n\nEnable S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket, so that you can restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten. It is important to note that versioning may increase storage costs, especially for applications that frequently overwrite objects in a bucket. In this case, consider implementing S3 Lifecycle policies to manage older versions and control storage costs.\n\nAdditionally, copy or take backups of critical data to a different bucket and perhaps to a different AWS account or AWS Region. To do this, you can use S3 replication to automatically copy objects between buckets. These buckets can reside in the same or in different AWS accounts, as well in the same or in different AWS Regions. S3 replication also offers an SLA for customers that have more stringent RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) requirements. Alternatively, you can use AWS Backup for S3, which is a managed service that automates periodic backup of S3 buckets.\n\n3. Monitor AWS resources for unexpected access patterns\n\nWithout monitoring, unauthorized actions on S3 buckets may go unnoticed. We recommend that you use tools such as AWS CloudTrail or S3 server access logs to monitor access to your data.\n\nYou can use AWS CloudTrail to log events across AWS services (including Amazon S3) and even combine logs into a single account to make them available to your security teams to access and monitor. You can also create CloudWatch alarms based on specific S3 metrics or logs to alert on unusual activity. These alerts can help you identify anomalous behavior quickly. You can also set up automation that uses Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda to automatically take corrective measures. You can find an example implementation of a setup used to scan all buckets across an organization and apply S3 Block Public Access. This blog post shows you how to audit encryption methods for object uploads in real time.\n\n4.Block the use of SSE-C encryption\n\nIf your applications don\u2019t use SSE-C as an encryption method, you can block the use of SSE-C with a resource policy applied to an S3 bucket, or by a resource control policy (RCP) applied to an organization in AWS Organizations.\n\nResource policies for S3 buckets are commonly referred to as bucket policies and allow customers to specify permissions for individual buckets in S3. A bucket policy can be applied using the S3 PutBucketPolicy API operation, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or through the AWS Management Console. Learn more about how bucket policies work in the S3 documentation. The following example shows a bucket policy that blocks SSE-C request for a bucket called <your-bucket-name> .\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"RestrictSSECObjectUploads\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3::: <your-bucket-name> /*\", \"Condition\": { \"Null\": { \"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\": \"false\" } } } ] }\n\nRCPs allow customers to specify the maximum available permissions that apply to resources across an entire organization in AWS Organizations. An RCP can be applied by using the AWS Organizations UpdatePolicy API operation, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or through the AWS Management Console. Learn more about how RCPs work in the AWS Organizations documentation. The following example shows an RCP that blocks SSE-C requests for buckets in the organization.\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"RestrictSSECObjectUploads\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\", \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"Null\": { \"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\": \"false\" } } } ] }\n\nSummary\n\nThe single most valuable thing you can do to protect yourself against common attacks against your AWS environment is to eliminate or minimize the use of long-term credentials (access key/secret key). After that, work on reducing privileges for all principals to the minimum necessary (so-called \u201cleast-privilege\u201d analysis). Beyond that, for the particular attack pattern discussed in this blog, we have highlighted the most common indicators to look for. As your security teams work to constantly protect your environment, know that a number of teams at AWS\u2014including the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT), Amazon Threat Intelligence, and services teams like the Amazon S3 team\u2014are working diligently to innovate, collaborate, and share insights to help protect your valuable data.\n\nIn this post, we provided an update on this recent threat to customer data and highlighted four security best practices that customers can use to protect against the risk of bad actors using SSE-C to encrypt data by using lost or stolen AWS credentials.\n\nAs threat actor tactics evolve, our commitment to customer security remains unwavering. Together, we are building a more secure cloud environment, allowing you to innovate with confidence.\n\nIf you ever suspect unauthorized activity, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact AWS Support immediately.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nTeladoc Health is joining an Amazon marketplace that aims to connect consumers with health benefits programs, the telehealth vendor said Monday.\n\nNow, eligible users can find and enroll in Teladoc\u2019s diabetes, hypertension, pre-diabetes and weight management programs through Amazon\u2019s Benefits Connector.\n\nThe program could help drive enrollment in Teladoc\u2019s chronic care offerings, executives said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it bringing revenue for us very quickly, but it is certainly something that we will continue to pursue in terms of growing our chronic care program,\u201d Teladoc CFO Mala Murthy said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon launched the benefits connector one year ago, starting with a partnership with chronic condition management company Omada.\n\nThe technology and retail giant has since expanded the initiative, previously called Health Condition Programs, to more digital health companies, including behavioral healthcare provider Talkspace, online therapy and mental health firm Rula and digital physical therapy company Hinge Health.\n\nThe benefits connector works by matching users with digital health programs and then checking when the benefits are covered through the consumer\u2019s insurance plan or employer. If eligible, users can apply to join the programs.\n\nSurfacing Teladoc\u2019s offerings will help eligible consumers more easily access its chronic care programs, which represent an important growth driver at the telehealth firm, executives said at JPM.\n\nThe company currently has more than one million active enrollees across its chronic condition programs, according to the Monday press release.\n\n\u201cWe offer chronic condition management programs extensively, and so we have a lot of people out there that we can recruit and enroll,\u201d Teladoc CEO Chuck Divita said at JPM, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s Amazon. They\u2019ve got a great consumer experience, so we're happy to be on the platform and see where it goes.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Teladoc has focused on cutting costs and restructuring its business. The virtual care firm\u2019s stock price has sunk compared with the heights reached during the COVID-19 pandemic as providers and patients turned to virtual care.\n\nDivita, a former insurance executive, is also relatively new to the role. He took on the top spot at the telehealth vendor in June, months after longtime CEO Jason Gorevic abruptly left the company.\n\nIn the third quarter, Teladoc recorded a $33.3 million net loss on revenue of $640.5 million, compared with a $57.1 million loss on $660.2 million in revenue during the same period last year.\n\nThe company will report fourth quarter earnings at the end of next month, according to Divita.",

The team expected to complete the consolidation by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cRather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2014 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture,\u201d wrote Castleberry, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Inclusive eXperiences and Technology. Her prior title, vice president of global diversity, equity and inclusion, changed with the name of the organization in 2023.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to detail the changes Castleberry\u2019s organization has made. The company continues to operate affinity groups \u2014 employee-led organizations formed to hear worker concerns and advocate for women, Black workers and military veterans, among other groups. Amazon is the second largest private US employer, behind Walmart Inc.\n\nThe overhaul comes as anti-DEI crusader Robby Starbuck racks up victories in a push to get corporate America to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs entirely. Companies including Walmart and Boeing Co. have announced that they\u2019re scrapping or stepping back from their initiatives.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. confirmed that it was disbanding many of its diversity and inclusion efforts. Harley-Davidson Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Deere & Co., meanwhile, are among companies that have said they will more tightly focus their employee resource groups on business purposes and ensure they are open to all employees.\n\nThe incoming US presidential administration is expected to be hostile to such initiatives, with some allies of President-Elect Donald Trump charging that they amount to discrimination against White workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cOur Positions\u201d web page \u2013 a clearinghouse of the company\u2019s stances on social and political issues \u2013 recently eliminated specific sections titled Equity for Black people and LGBTQ+ rights. The Information reported those changes earlier Friday.\n\nThe updated page collapses these topics into a single paragraph on diversity, equity and inclusion, saying Amazon is committed \u201cto creating a diverse and inclusive company that helps us build the best range of products and services for our broad customer base.\u201d The statement says inequitable treatment of anyone is unacceptable.\n\nSpecific references to Amazon\u2019s support for legislation to combat racial bias in policing, efforts to expand voting rights, and codify protections for transgender people were eliminated from the web page.\n\n\u201cWe update this page from time to time to ensure that it reflects updates we\u2019ve made to various programs and positions,\u201d spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in an emailed statement.\n\nPhoto: Employees place items in to boxes and envelopes at an Amazon.com Inc. fulfillment center.

With a price tag in the billions of reais, the expansion is needed to ensure cheaper, more efficient transportation of agricultural commodities out of the Amazon, the government says. But an investigation by Mongabay contributor Tiffany Higgins found minimal economic benefits compared to the high socioenvironmental costs the project will likely bring.\n\nThe Tocantins-Araguaia waterway project began under the previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, but in August 2024, federal prosecutors sued to stop the process, claiming the environmental review was incomplete. Indeed, 27 required studies were missing from the process.\n\nParts of the channel project were approved with hydrology data from 2017, when river levels were much higher than in the last two years when a crippling drought caused record-low water levels. The Tocantins River, for example, is normally 3-3.5 meters (9.8-11.5 feet) high in the dry season, but in October 2024 it was just 2 m (6.6 ft) high. Many barges need at least 2.5 m (8.2 ft) of water to safely navigate rivers. So, a large area may need to be dredged, significantly adding to the cost of the project. Ships can lighten their load to sit higher in the water, an option that will also make shipping more expensive and each bargeload of grain more carbon intensive.\n\n\u201cEvery foot of reduced water depth or draft is the equivalent of loading 7,000 fewer bushels of soybeans per barge,\u201d Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the U.S. Soy Transportation Coalition, told Mongabay.\n\nClimate scientists say the Amazon Basin will become drier with climate change; the Tocantins River is expected to shrink by half in the next 25 years.\n\nHiggins also reports that the channel project didn\u2019t receive the free, prior and informed consent of local stakeholders, as required by Brazilian law. Local fishers report being harassed and coerced to leave their traditional territories as real estate speculation has driven up the value of nearby land.\n\nUnder Brazilian law, the National Department of Transport Infrastructure (DNIT) must compensate local people for any losses incurred as a result of an infrastructure project. But the department says it\u2019s only responsible for damages from dredging and blasting and won\u2019t pay for damages from operations. That will leave many communities without compensation. Local fisherman Nilton Lopes de Melo told Mongabay that the compensation DNIT plans to give, $230 per month for 30 months, is inadequate.\n\n\u201cPoisoned drinking water, and fish poisoned by dynamite, which no one will want to eat,\u201d will last long after the detonations end, he said. He accused the DNIT of \u201cviolating our rights as traditional river peoples.\u201d\n\nThis is a summary of \u201cBrazil\u2019s shipping channel plans in Amazonian rivers will worsen climate change, experts warn\u201d by Tiffany Higgins.\n\nBanner image of a traditional fisherperson near Tauiry Village.

More than 200 new eActros 600 vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Trucks will join Amazon\u2019s existing eHGV transportation network from later this year.\n\nThis order is part of our commitment under The Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040. For transportation, this includes increasing route efficiency, scaling zero-exhaust emission and alternative fuel vehicles, and partnering with industry and governments to accelerate the deployment of charging infrastructure.\n\nThe electric trucks will be deployed across high-mileage routes that make up Amazon\u2019s middle-mile network in the UK and Germany, transporting trailers to and from Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centres, sort centres and delivery stations. Combined, the zero-exhaust emission vehicles are expected to transport more than 350 million packages each year once fully operational.\n\nHeavy vehicle charging infrastructure is a critical step to bringing more electric heavy goods vehicles to European roads, and is a challenge to scale due to the distance vehicles need to travel, how often and how fast they can charge, and the availability of power in suitable locations. Amazon will install 360kW electric charging points at key sites, capable of charging the battery of the 40-tonne trucks from 20 to 80 percent in just over an hour; and will work with stakeholders to support the installation of external charging points in suitable locations to enable longer journeys.\n\nAbout the eHGVs\n\nThe eActros 600 is the flagship long-haul e-truck from Mercedes-Benz Trucks. It offers an installed battery capacity of more than 600 kilowatt hours and a range of 500 kilometres without recharge. Mercedes-Benz Trucks recently started production of the eActros 600 at its plant in W\u00f6rth, Germany.\n\nAndreas Marschner, Vice President of Amazon Worldwide Operations Sustainability, said: \u201cThis order of more than 200 electric trucks underlines our commitment to being a leader in electrifying heavy goods transportation in Europe. It is the biggest electric heavy truck order by Amazon to date anywhere in the world, and is an important step as we work to achieve our Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040. We look forward to sharing our learnings, and will continue to collaborate with stakeholders to support the transition to more electric heavy goods vehicles on European roads, and so more efficient and lower-emission deliveries for Amazon\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also announced that in the UK, we're using the electric rail network to transport packages at scale for the first time; and we\u2019re launching new on-foot customer deliveries across London, with associates using carts that can be restocked on-the-go from vans dotted around the capital; and in Germany, the number of electric delivery vans from Rivian has been doubled to more than 600; and the success of electric cargo bike deliveries continues, with over 1.5 million packages delivered last year in Berlin alone. By end of 2024, these hubs were operational in Germany\u2019s five largest cities: Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, and Frankfurt, as well as in Koblenz, Aachen, Freiburg and Essen.\n\nWe're also investing more than \u20ac1 billion in the coming years to further electrify and decarbonise our transportation network across Europe to help reduce carbon emissions associated with delivering packages to customers. At the end of 2024, there were 38 eHGVs in Amazon\u2019s transportation network across Europe, with nearly 50 electric heavy trucks recently deployed in California. In addition to eHGVs, Amazon and our delivery partners have more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers across Europe and this number is expected to grow to more than 10,000 vehicles by the end of 2025. We've also doubled the number of cities with micromobility hubs, which enable millions of deliveries on foot or using electric cargo bikes, from 20 in 2022 to more than 45 in 2024, with recent additions in Belfast, Madrid, Rome and Vienna joining London, Paris, Milan and Munich.\n\nThe electric fleet serves Amazon\u2019s logistics services, which are available online through Amazon Freight (AF).

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAmazon is the latest company to shift the tone of its approach to diversity and inclusion, according to an internal memo released Dec. 16 that CNBC said it had obtained.\n\nWhat Candi Castleberry, Amazon\u2019s VP of inclusive experiences and technology, outlined concretely is that Amazon unified separate employee resource groups.\n\n\u201cRather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2014 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture,\u201d Castleberry said in the memo.\n\nHR Dive reached out to Amazon and Amazon representatives several times but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years we took a new approach, reviewing hundreds of programs across the company, using science to evaluate their effectiveness, impact, and ROI \u2014 identifying the ones we believed should continue. Each one of these addresses a specific disparity, and is designed to end when that disparity is eliminated,\u201d Castleberry said.\n\nSubtle changes in policy framing\n\nPrevious practices were characterized as \u201cbolted on.\u201d Now, Castleberry said, Amazon seeks to \u201cmove away from programs that were separate from our existing processes,\u201d instead moving toward programs that are \u201cbuilt in\u201d and \u201cborn inclusive.\u201d\n\nThe memo did not explicitly say that Amazon will be eliminating DEI at the company, despite headlines that claim as much.\n\n\n\nStill, while Amazon\u2019s policy positions webpage has stated and does state, as of Jan. 13, \u201cthat inequitable treatment of anyone \u2014 including Black people, LGBTQ+ people, Asians, women, and others \u2014 is unacceptable,\u201d the company has eliminated the specific Black equity and LGBTQ+ rights sections from its website.\n\nWhat Amazon's policy page looks like on Jan. 14, 2025. Caroline Colvin/HR Dive, screenshot from Amazon's Policy Positions page\n\nPreviously between the \u201cDiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d and the \u201cImmigration reform\u201d sections existed two sections titled \u201cEquity for Black people\u201d and \u201cLGBTQ+ rights,\u201d according to the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback machine.\n\nAn earlier version of Amazon's policy page included more explicit support for Black people and LGBTQ+ people. Caroline Colvin/HR Dive, screenshot from Internet Archive's Wayback Machine\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2024, for example, Amazon\u2019s website contained a statement on the inequitable treatment of Black people.\n\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners, and we are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear,\u201d it previously said. \u201cWe support legislation to combat misconduct and racial bias in policing, efforts to protect and expand voting rights, and initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, on Dec. 17, 2024, Amazon\u2019s website contained open commitment to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\u201cWe were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state level on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act,\u201d the website once said.\n\nThe page also made note of gender-affirming care provided by the company, aligned with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health\u2019s best practices.\n\nThese aspects of Amazon\u2019s front-facing policy no longer exist on this page.\n\nPar for the course, for some\n\nShareholders at some companies, such as Lululemon and Costco, appear to be sticking to DEI as a business practice \u2014 whether for pure profit or moral reasons remains to be seen.\n\nOther employers are continuing last year\u2019s trend of backing away from DEI. Amazon\u2019s changes became public knowledge around the same time that news broke that Meta cut DEI roles and programs.\n\nCastleberry did note, however, that Amazon \u201cbelieve[s] this is important work, so we\u2019ll keep investing in programs that help us reflect those audiences, help employees grow, thrive, and connect.\u201d",

(WTOC/Gray News) - A 66-year-old Georgia man was beaten within an inch of his life after police say he opened his front door to two men posing as Amazon employees.\n\nGeorge \u201cDirk\u201d Hardison, 66, answered his front door around 8 a.m. Saturday after two men he thought were Amazon workers delivering a package knocked. The suspects then pushed their way into Hardison\u2019s home in Savannah and attacked him, WTOC reports.\n\nPolice allege the two men demanded money before beating the 66-year-old with some sort of sledgehammer. The attack lasted for nearly eight minutes.\n\nHardison can be heard in video footage yelling out for help from his neighbors, who showed up soon after to find him covered in blood with multiple head injuries. He was hospitalized and received 14 staples in his head.\n\nThe suspects made off with only $80.\n\nVideo footage shows the suspects with covered faces both before and after the attack. They were disguised as Amazon workers, wearing signature blue and black jackets and carrying a package. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, was in the box they brought with them. They left with the same package.\n\nPolice are still searching for the suspects. They describe the two men as younger black males in their 20s with medium brown complexions.\n\nThe suspects are set to be charged with aggravated assault, aggravated battery and home invasion, at minimum.\n\nIn the meantime, as Hardison recovers, the bar where he works \u2013 O\u2019Connell\u2019s Pub \u2013 has started a GoFundMe to help him, saying, \u201cThe police are investigating this heinous crime, but in the meantime, let\u2019s show Dirk the love and support he deserves.\u201d\n\nAmazon sent WTOC the following statement about the attack:\n\n\u201cBased off our internal investigation, we can confirm that these individuals were not making a scheduled delivery for Amazon. We monitor the Internet regularly for unauthorized Amazon apparel and demand that those items be removed when and where we can. People who make deliveries on behalf of Amazon do not routinely knock on doors nor ask customers to sign for packages unless already prearranged.\u201d\n\nThe investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information on this crime should call Savannah Police directly.\n\nCopyright 2025 WTOC via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Alexa would suggest restaurants or set lights in a bedroom according to a user\u2019s sleep cycles.\n\nMultiple workers from Amazon\u2019s voice assistant team said the project was saddled with complications after years of AI research and development, according to the report. Former workers said the delayed rollout was chiefly due to the unexpected difficulties of switching and combining the simpler, predefined algorithms Alexa was built on with more powerful but less predictable large language models.\n\nAmazon said it is \u201cworking hard to enable even more proactive and capable assistance\u201d of its voice assistant, per the report.\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cHow Consumers Want to Live in the Voice Economy\u201d found that roughly a quarter of American consumers said they would be willing to pay $10 per month to access a virtual assistant that could handle everyday tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, in retail applications, Keith Kirkpatrick, research director of enterprise applications at The Futurum Group, told PYMNTS this month: \u201cI think in time, AI agents will impact certain job functions in retail, but most of these tasks are digital, as opposed to physical tasks. As such, many of these functions are still marketing- or commerce-based, and retailers will be looking to companies in adjacent industries to see how well AI agents \u2026 are delivering value to their customers.\u201d\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

Amazon\u2019s transportation network will grow from nine to more than 160 electric trucks in the UK, transporting more than 300 million customer packages each year.\n\n14 January 2025, London, UK \u2013 Amazon today announced the expansion of zero-exhaust emission deliveries in the UK, with its largest-ever order of electric heavy-goods vehicles (eHGVs). For the first time, Amazon packages are now also being transported at scale on the UK\u2019s electric rail network. In addition, the company has launched on-foot customer deliveries for the first time in central London, with trolleys that can be restocked while on-the-go.\n\nThese developments will help take traditional diesel vans and trucks off the UK\u2019s roads, reduce carbon emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve air quality, as part of Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its operations by 2040.\n\n\u201cDecarbonising our transport network is key in helping us achieve our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040 and today\u2019s announcement is an exciting and major step forward for us in this mission, said Nicola Fyfe, EU VP of Amazon Logistics. \u201cThe combination of our \u2013 and the UK\u2019s \u2013 biggest ever order of eHGVs, the UK\u2019s electric rail network now being used to transport customer packages, and the launch of restocking on the move on-foot deliveries, all alongside our partners\u2019 fleet of electric vans and e-cargo bikes, will help us move more customer orders across our fulfilment network with zero exhaust emissions. This is a win for our customers, the environment and our business.\u201d\n\nE-trucks and trains in Amazon\u2019s transportation network\n\nMore than 140 new electric Mercedes-Benz Truck eActros 600 trucks and eight Volvo FM Battery Electric trucks are joining Amazon\u2019s transportation network over the next 18 months as part of the UK\u2019s largest-ever eHGV order, an increase from the nine eHGVs currently operating across Amazon\u2019s transportation network. The new eHGVs are expected to transport more than 300 million packages each year in the UK with no exhaust emissions once fully operational.\n\nThe company will also install additional fast charging infrastructure across key UK sites, including 360kW electric charging points capable of charging the 40-tonne Mercedes-Benz Truck eActros 600 trucks from 20 to 80 per cent in just over an hour. The new electric trucks will have a range of 310 miles (500 km) on full charge.\n\nAround 20 of the Mercedes-Benz trucks will join Amazon\u2019s transportation network following the company\u2019s participation in the UK Government\u2019s Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator programme (ZEHID), with a proportion funded by the Department for Transport and coordinated in partnership with Innovate UK. Amazon has also added eight additional Volvo FM Battery Electric trucks as part of the programme.\n\nThe new electric trucks, operated by Amazon\u2019s carrier partners, will haul trailers with products and customer packages to and from Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centres, sort centres and finally delivery stations, from where packages are delivered to customers\u2019 doorsteps.\n\nFor the first time, Amazon is using the UK\u2019s electric rail network to transport packages at scale, reducing traffic congestion and emissions.\n\nFor the first time in the UK, Amazon has also launched rail deliveries at scale. Amazon products are loaded onto train carriages on the fully electric West Coast Main Line between Scotland and the Midlands. Products are then picked up from stations close to local Amazon delivery and fulfilment centres\u2013 ready for sorting and packing ahead of customer deliveries. Products are also transported from stations and Amazon\u2019s wider fulfilment network to ferry ports, to further reduce on-road traffic, while giving small and medium sized UK businesses easier access to European markets .\n\nMore than 20 million products sold on Amazon are expected to travel on the UK\u2019s electric rail network this year, avoiding traffic congestion and carbon emissions, with plans to expand across further rail routes before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cFrom the supply of the 7.5T Fuso eCanter in 2021, we are excited to continue to build on this electric journey with our partners at Amazon, said Heiko Selzam, Managing Director of Daimler Truck UK Ltd. \u201cThis order of more than 140 eActros 600 for the UK signifies their understanding of the importance these trucks will have, as they drive to reach their net-zero carbon emissions targets.\u201d\n\nFuture of Roads Minister, Lilian Greenwood said: \u201cBusiness has a crucial role to play in decarbonising our roads, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s fantastic to see Amazon place the UK\u2019s biggest ever order of electric trucks, supported in part by the Government\u2019s \u00a3200m \u2018Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Demonstrator\u2019 project. This comes on top of our \u00a32.3 billion to help industry and consumers switch to electric vehicles, supporting jobs, attracting investment and making Britain a clean energy superpower.\u201d\n\nZero-exhaust emission deliveries to customers\u2019 doorsteps\n\nAmazon introduces on-foot deliveries that restock on the move across central London, with pilots developed in partnership with the London Boroughs of Hackney, Westminster and Islington.\n\nAmazon has also launched new on-foot deliveries across central London, with pilots developed in partnership with the London Boroughs of Hackney, Westminster and Islington. Delivery associates are making customer deliveries on foot with carts that can be restocked on-the-go from vans dotted around the capital. This will help Amazon make more zero-exhaust emission deliveries than ever before, with fewer motorised van trips. More than 70% of London\u2019s Congestion Charge zone is now covered by electric vans, e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries, operated by Amazon\u2019s partners.\n\nThe company is expanding electric deliveries across UK city centres, with recent electric cargo bike launches in Belfast and Norwich, joining existing Amazon partner fleets in London, Manchester and Glasgow. To date, more than 500,000 Amazon customer delivery routes have changed from traditional fuel vehicles to zero-exhaust emission alternatives.\n\nSince 2022, Amazon has made more than 150 million deliveries using its electric vans and cargo bikes in the UK. Delivery drivers have driven more than 19 million miles in the electric vans and cycled more than 900,000 miles on the electric cargo bikes across the UK, on routes that would have been otherwise driven by vans with traditional fuel.\n\n\u201cDecarbonisation is one of the biggest challenges facing the logistics industry, as businesses seek to match the need to move away from a reliance on fossil fuels with pressures from customers to maximise delivery efficiency, said Michelle Gardner, Deputy Director, Policy, Logistics UK. \u201cCurrently, almost 90% of the UK\u2019s freight is moved by road, so it is important that the sector considers alternatively-fuelled vehicles and a shift to different transport modes in order to fulfil demand. Today\u2019s announcement from Amazon demonstrates the sector\u2019s willingness to change and its commitment to reducing overall emissions.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s electric cargo bike deliveries are now operational from hubs in more than 45 cities across the UK and Europe, with recent additions in Belfast, Norwich, Madrid, Rome and Vienna joining London, Manchester, Glasgow, Paris, Milan and Munich.",

The announcement came shortly after conservative activist and social media influencer Robby Starbuck told Amazon he was investigating their DEI efforts.\n\nAmazon Human Resources Executive Candi Castleberry emailed staff about the updates to their DEI initiatives. The announcement explained that they would be ditching programs focused on \u201cindividual groups\u201d and instead offer initiatives open to every employee.\n\n\u201cWe worked to unify employee groups together under one umbrella, and build programs that are open to all,\u201d the Amazon memo stated, obtained by FOX Business. \u201cRather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2013 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.\u201d\n\nMore from Jason Rantz: Two more Seattle restaurants close over \u2018untenable\u2019 minimum wage hike\n\nHow did Amazon ditch the woke DEI initiatives?\n\nThe memo didn\u2019t detail which specific programs would be cut. But Amazon did remove sections from its website focused on \u201cEquity for Black people,\u201d \u201cLGBTQ+ rights\u201d and \u201cDiversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d according to CNBC.\n\nThe move comes as Meta, McDonald\u2019s, Ford and Walmart changed their DEI initiatives, which were adopted during the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020.\n\nActivist Robby Starbuck emailed Amazon in early December 2024 to alert them that they were \u201cworking on a story about Amazon,\u201d but before they would move forward, asked if the company was \u201cready to make changes to their woke policies or if they\u2019re still committed to DEI.\u201d He lambasted Amazon for funding LGBT pride events that \u201cexpose kids to sexual topics\u201d and for \u201cseparating employees into groups by race and sexual preference.\u201d\n\nStarbuck promises that if Amazon doesn\u2019t \u201cspecifically state what these changes are, I\u2019ll proceed with our report later this month exposing their woke policies, practices and failures because the public deserves to know if these policies still reflect Amazon\u2019s views.\u201d\n\nMore from Jason Rantz: Democrats\u2019 law prohibits child care employers from reporting illegal immigrants to feds\n\nRIP DEI at Amazon and beyond\n\nThe slow and overdue death of DEI coincides with the election of Donald Trump. The election has been seen by many as a rebuke of Democrats\u2019 hard left turn. As a candidate, Trump has railed against \u201cwoke\u201d policies that do more harm than good. Even some within the Democratic party have complained that it has become too extreme.\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd, corporations took up DEI initiatives primarily out of pressure from far-left activist groups and media outlets that amplified their messages. It went from a race-obsessed focus to a preoccupation with gender identity.\n\nDespite the \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d moniker, the movement contrived grievances in the workforce to punish certain groups (primarily white, heterosexual men), while lifting others (primarily black, Latino and transgender workers) solely based on identity. So-called affinity groups were formed that only allowed members of certain identify groups be allowed to attend. Training taught employees that white people were systematically targeted and blamed for every societal ill. And hiring efforts purposefully turned down more qualified candidates for applicants who checked off certain identity boxes. Consequently, business suffered.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously a business and societal benefit to rid us of these intentionally divisive DEI programs. The companies that felt forced into these efforts are finally given the cover to ditch them without community pushback. And Amazon won\u2019t be the last to say no.\n\nMore from Jason Rantz: Panic as Seattle restaurants may not survive massive minimum wage shift\n\nListen to The Jason Rantz Show on weekday afternoons from 3-7 p.m. on KTTH 770 AM (HD Radio 97.3 FM HD-Channel 3).

Amazon Bedrock enables customers to leverage generative AI capabilities while maintaining the highest levels of security and data protection required for their Top Secret workloads.\n\n\u201cThis milestone enables us to bring the power of frontier models like Anthropic\u2019s upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet to our U.S. Government customers,\u201d said Dave Levy, Vice President of Worldwide Public Sector at AWS. \u201cWe are delivering capabilities that will reshape how national security organizations process information, make decisions, and support critical missions.\u201d\n\nWhat is Amazon Bedrock?\n\nAmazon Bedrock is a scalable, fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing FMs from leading AI companies through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsibility. Using Amazon Bedrock, customers can easily experiment with and evaluate frontier multimodal models for their use cases and connect models to their data using techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, customers don\u2019t have to manage any infrastructure, and they can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into their applications using the AWS services they are already familiar with.\n\nModel and feature availability\n\nAmazon Bedrock launched in the AWS Top Secret cloud with Anthropic\u2019s upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the Amazon Titan Text Embedding v2 models. Both models are accessible on demand.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Customers have access to the latest Claude multimodal model that delivers across-the-board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding\u2014an area where it already led the field, according to Anthropic. The model also raises the bar across a range of cognitive tasks. It more deeply understands nuanced instructions and context, generates creative solutions to problems, recognizes and corrects mistakes, and delivers more sophisticated analysis around complex data. Other use cases in which the upgraded model excels include knowledge Q&A platforms, data extraction from visuals like charts and diagrams, and automation of repetitive tasks and operations.\n\nAmazon Titan Text Embedding v2. Using Titan Text Embeddings, customers can perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks by representing text data as numerical vectors, known as embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic and contextual relationships between words, phrases, or documents in a high-dimensional vector space. This model is optimized for RAG use cases and is also well suited for a variety of other tasks such as information retrieval, Q&A chatbots, classification, and personalized recommendations.\n\nAmazon Bedrock in the AWS Top Secret cloud features the console, playgrounds, and Guardrails. Knowledge Bases and Agents are planned for future releases, along with additional FMs.\n\nUse cases for defense and intelligence\n\nAmazon Bedrock offers powerful AI capabilities tailored for defense and intelligence applications.\n\nWriting assistant\n\nStreamline the creation of intelligence reports, operational briefs, and strategic communications. Amazon Bedrock\u2019s writing assistance can help analysts and operators produce clear, concise documents while adhering to specific security protocols and terminology.\n\nCoding assistant\n\nAccelerate the development of mission-critical software and data analysis tools. Anthropic\u2019s Claude coding capabilities can assist software engineers in writing secure, efficient code for defense systems and intelligence platforms.\n\nIntelligent search and analysis with RAG\n\nEnhance AI responses with classified and sensitive data repositories. RAG allows intelligence agencies to combine large language models (LLMs) with their mission databases, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant analysis for complex geopolitical scenarios and threat assessments.\n\nThese capabilities empower customers working with classified data to process information more efficiently, make data-driven decisions faster, and stay ahead in an ever-evolving global security landscape.\n\nWhy use Amazon Bedrock?\n\nThere are three compelling reasons to use Amazon Bedrock for building generative AI applications:\n\nAccess to leading FMs\n\nAmazon Bedrock offers an easy-to-use developer experience to work with Anthropic\u2019s Claude multimodal model and Amazon Titan Text Embedding model. Customers can quickly experiment in the playground, and use a single API for inference to keep up to date with the latest model versions with minimal code changes.\n\nExtend the power of FMs with proprietary data\n\nCustomers can securely connect FMs to their data sources for retrieval augmentation, extending the FM\u2019s already powerful capabilities and making it more knowledgeable about customer-specific domain and organization. Native support for RAG through Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases will be available in the future.\n\nData security and compliance certifications\n\nAmazon Bedrock offers several capabilities to support security and privacy requirements. With Amazon Bedrock, customer content and queries are not retained, are not used to improve the base models, and are not shared with any model providers. Customer data in Amazon Bedrock is encrypted in transit and at rest, and customers can optionally encrypt the data using their own keys. Customers can use AWS PrivateLink with Amazon Bedrock to establish private connectivity between their FMs and their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) without exposing their traffic to any shared networks in or out of AWS.\n\nWhat\u2019s next in the AWS Top Secret Cloud\n\nThroughout 2025, AWS will continue to launch generative AI capabilities in the AWS Top Secret cloud and other classified regions.\n\n\u201cOur mission is clear: to empower our U.S. Government customers with cutting-edge generational capabilities,\u201d said Dave Nolton, Vice President of Region Services at AWS. \u201cWe are focused on delivering the right models, services, and capabilities across our hyper scale classified infrastructure. The General Availability of Amazon Bedrock in the AWS Top Secret cloud will enable choice for these customers. As we have across the history of our partnership, we continue to innovate in support of our customers.\u201d\n\nWe are excited to bring Amazon Bedrock to our U.S. Government customers.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAmazon is ending its Try Before You Buy service this month after a nearly eight-year run.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Retail Dive that the company is phasing out Try Before You Buy on Jan. 31. The spokesperson said the move is in response to increasing customer use of AI-powered features like virtual try-on and personalized size recommendations that help customers get the right fit.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Prime Try Before You Buy service gave members a seven-day, hands-on trial for select men\u2019s, women\u2019s, kids\u2019 and baby clothes, shoes and accessories.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmazon is ending its Stitch Fix-like service at the end of this month, as AI features catch on among shoppers.\n\nAmazon began offering Try Before You Buy as a beta program under the name Amazon Prime Wardrobe in 2017. It debuted with 1 million items across name brands like Levi\u2019s and Adidas. Amazon expanded the service\u2019s availability to more Prime customers less than a year later.\n\nThe move came as Stitch Fix was rising in popularity, Retail Dive reported at the time. But Stitch Fix\u2019s performance has lagged in recent years. Net revenue fell 16% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended Aug. 3. The company is pursuing a turnaround strategy that\u2019s centered on revamping the client experience and it expects to return to growth by the end of fiscal year 2026, CEO Matt Baer said. Other box services, like Trunk Club, have shut down entirely.\n\nSince Amazon launched the program, surveys and data indicate returns have become more of a financial and logistics pain point for retailers. Meanwhile, Amazon and other retailers are introducing and expanding the availability of AI-powered shopping apps.\n\n\u201cTry Before You Buy worked well in the days when Amazon was trying to build its customer base in apparel. However, the program adds operational complexity, and it almost encourages consumers to make returns,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, told Retail Dive in an email. \u201cNow Amazon is a more significant player in apparel with much higher volumes, it likely wants to simplify and streamline things.\u201d\n\nThe National Retail Federation and reverse logistics company Happy Returns forecast that shoppers would return $890 billion of merchandise in 2024, a December report found. That figure represents nearly 17% of retailers\u2019 annual sales.",

            "content": "The National Labor Relations Board granted Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity & Empowerment (CAUSE) approval Jan. 7 to hold a union election, which would make Amazon\u2019s RDU1 fulfillment center in Garner, North Carolina, the first such facility to unionize in the South.\n\nThe election is set to take place between Feb. 10 and Feb. 15 at the fulfillment center. If a majority of the roughly 4,800 RDU1 employees vote in favor of CAUSE, Amazon will be required to negotiate in good faith on a contract, according to Professor of Cultural Anthropology Orin Starn.\n\n\u201cIt was a real fight to get the election, and it's really hard to form a union in the United States because the laws really do not favor workers who are trying to organize a union,\u201d Starn said. \u201c\u2026 It's going to be a pretty hard-fought campaign, and we're just trying to get the message out that we're fighting for workers.\u201d\n\nThe organization began its unionization efforts on Labor Day \u2014 Sept. 2 \u2014 with organizers rallying active RDU1 employees to collect signed union authorization cards to initiate an election. Though the NLRB allows organizations one year to collect the required signatures from 30% of active employees, CAUSE surpassed the threshold number of signatures in four months and filed an election petition Dec. 23.\n\nThroughout the organization\u2019s unionization campaign, CAUSE has demanded a $30 minimum hourly wage, 180 hours a year in paid leave time, a full hour of paid break during shifts, more paid holiday time, accommodations for injured and disabled workers and equal treatment of all workers regardless of sex, race and nationality.\n\n\u201cWe're not trying to get rich,\u201d said Rev. Ryan Brown, president of CAUSE and former RDU1 employee. \u201dWe just want to be able to provide for our families and not have to work so many different jobs just to barely get by.\u201d\n\nDespite workers\u2019 demands, Amazon maintains that its benefits are already competitive.\n\n\u201cAll full-time employees have access to affordable medical, behavioral health, prescription drug, dental and vision coverage, regardless of their level, tenure or position within the company,\u201d wrote Amazon Public Relations Manager Eileen Hards in a Jan. 10 email to The Chronicle. \u201cMoreover, these benefits start day one, unlike most other large retail competitors \u2014 there\u2019s no waiting period before they kick in. Part-time and reduced-time flex workers also have medical benefit options.\u201d\n\nHards previously wrote in a Nov. 1 email to The Chronicle that Amazon employees \u201chave [always had] the choice of whether or not to join a union.\u201d Starn, who worked undercover at Amazon for two years to \u201csee what it was really like,\u201d views Amazon\u2019s actions as \u201cunion busting.\u201d He cited posters placed around the facility, at least one reading \u201cunions run their businesses with your money.\u201d The company has also hosted voluntary union education sessions where company representatives cautioned warehouse employees about the costs of dues upon joining a union. In a photo shared by Starn, a digital sign told employees they have \u201cno obligation\u201d to speak to a representative of any group, including a union. He further noted that the company \u201cdoes not let [workers collect signatures] in the warehouse itself\u201d and that they are only allowed to do so \u201cin the break rooms or through a QR code outside the facility.\u201d In a statement to the News & Observer, Amazon alleged that CAUSE \u201chas never negotiated a union contract anywhere and has no experience representing workers or their interests.\u201d\n\nStarn also enlisted the help of Duke student volunteers in the unionization effort. Junior Morven Thomson shared her experience engaging with the facility\u2019s workers by \u201chanding out flyers to the cars, which explained what a union authorization card is.\u201d\n\nThomson further described volunteers\u2019 efforts to alleviate the concerns of the workers, some of whom feared repercussions if they signed in favor of the election.\n\nAmazon is not required to disclose the number of workers in the warehouse, meaning that CAUSE had to estimate the number of signatures needed. A high turnover rate in the facility further complicated the process, as the NLRB does not accept signatures from former employees, even if they signed the card as an active worker.\n\nAccording to a CAUSE press release, three union-affiliated employees were fired in the past year, including Brown. He feels that the employees were \u201ctargeted for termination.\u201d\n\n\u201c[In] my specific case, I was accused of making comments that I never said. I was accused of making racist comments by using the word \u2018Uncle Tom,\u2019\u201d Brown alleged. He shared that he found this upsetting, having experienced \u201ccruel racism\u201d throughout his upbringing.\n\nThe press release also claims that Amazon called the Garner police on activists who were handing out free food and informing workers about the union. Three people working with CAUSE were arrested at the facility.\n\nEven if CAUSE fares successfully in the election, Starn shared that challenges still lie ahead for the union effort. He pointed to the Amazon facility JFK8, where despite voting to unionize in 2022 and receiving NLRB certification, a contract has not been negotiated. He further alleged that Amazon has not bargained in good faith.\n\n\u201cWe have to control the narrative of why we are here, why we need to vote yes and the historical gravity of this moment,\u201d Brown said.\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Sign up for our weekly newsletter.

            "content": "Amazon\u2019s new Retail Ad Service, announced last week, is certainly the biggest retail media news of the year so far. In offering its ad-tech to power other retailers' media networks (RMNs) , Amazon could disrupt how retail media operates for retailers , advertisers , vendors, and consumers alike.\n\n\u201cBecause Amazon's owned-and-operated channels are nearing a point of saturation, sustained growth will increasingly depend on the company's ability to identify additional growth engines. Amazon Retail Service theoretically enables Amazon to get more mileage out of its well-honed capabilities and expertise,\u201d said our analyst Sarah Marzano. \u201cWhat remains to be seen is whether a meaningful volume of retailers can be convinced to partner with a direct competitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers, and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience,\u201d said Paula Despins, vice president of Amazon Ads Measurement, in a press release .\n\nRetail Ad Service will certainly impact each of these stakeholders. Here's how it will affect them.\n\nRetailers have a choice\n\nRetailers that adopt Amazon Retail Ad Service will be able to sell via the Amazon Ads console, allowing them to reach Amazon\u2019s advertisers and scale their media networks. These retailers may also have a high level of trust in Amazon\u2019s ad tech, which is the same technology it\u2019s using to bring in $47.52 billion in ad revenues this year, per our November 2024 forecast.\n\nThis is the motivation of iHerb, which has implemented Retail Ad Service into its media network in beta. \"With over 1,200 shared brands already active on Amazon Ads, this creates a frictionless opportunity for advertisers to connect with iHerb's highly motivated audience and drive measurable results,\u201d said Neil Folgate, senior vice president of global marketing at iHerb, in Amazon\u2019s press release.\n\nBut for retailers, adopting Amazon\u2019s ad tech also means teaming up with a retail media rival. Clients will need to pay up to Amazon, and they\u2019ll have to trust Amazon with consumer data, though Amazon should not be able to access that data, per the announcement.\n\nBrands have a chance to streamline\n\nBrands already advertising on Amazon will now have access to even more RMNs, and they\u2019ll be able to invest in them without the challenge of managing analytics across platforms. That\u2019s a huge pro for brands, considering more than half of brands (55%) consider lack of standardization across platforms the biggest challenge related to RMNs, per the Association of National Advertisers.\n\nThis move may make brands even more reliant on Amazon than they actually are, which is a potential downside for companies that don\u2019t want to be at the whim of a single giant. But the potential for standardized analytics across RMNs could outweigh the cons.",

(WTOC) - Stunning video has now been released of two men dressed as Amazon workers attacking a Savannah man inside of his home.\n\nThe man opened his front door, expecting a package Saturday morning, but instead, police say he was beaten by two men posing as Amazon employees.\n\nIt\u2019s startling footage that\u2019ll put anyone who orders online on edge. WTOC spent the day speaking with neighbors about this terrifying attack.\n\nGeorge \u2018Dirk\u2019 Hardison opened his front door to those he thought were Amazon workers who were delivering a package that morning. That is, until they pushed their way into his home, then attacked and beat him. The incident was caught on camera.\n\nThe 66-year-old Savannah man was beaten within an inch of his life Saturday morning around 8:00 a.m., sending him to the hospital to get 14 staples in his head.\n\nTwo men disguised as Amazon workers walked straight into a home on Price St., covered their faces, wore signature blue and black jackets, and even carried a package. It\u2019s unclear what exactly was in the box that they brought with them. They also left with the same package.\n\nThe police report alleges that the two men demanded money once inside, before beating Hardison with some sort of sledgehammer. The attack lasted for nearly eight minutes.\n\nThe two young men made off with only $80 dollars. Footage captured the two leaving with the same package they walked up with, and the homeowner screaming out for help.\n\nHardison yelled out for neighbors who showed up soon after to find him covered in blood with multiple head injuries.\n\nThe first man who ran to Hardion\u2019s aid told police, \u201cThat he saw a black male wearing an Amazon jacket running on E. Huntingdon Street towards E Broad St.\u201d\n\nAccording to that report, Savannah Police Officers \u201cobserved several lacerations on Mr. Hardison\u2019s head as he was sitting in his own blood from his injuries.\u201d\n\nPolice are still searching for these suspects. They describe the two men as younger black males, with medium brown complexion, and in their 20s.\n\nThey are set to be charged with aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and home invasion at minimum.\n\nIn the meantime, as Hardison recovers, the bar where he works- O\u2019Connell\u2019s Pub, has started a GoFundMe to help with his recovery. As of 2 p.m. Monday, that total stands at $4,500 raised for his recovery.\n\nAnother social media post about the GoFundMe reads, \u201cThe police are investigating this heinous crime, but in the meantime, let\u2019s show Dirk the love and support he deserves.\u201d\n\nWTOC reached out to Mr. Hardison but we\u2019re told he is still recovering in the hospital from this attack.\n\nWTOC also reached out to Amazon.\n\nAmazon reps tell us these men in this video were not making a scheduled delivery.\n\nTheir company continues to monitor the internet for unauthorized Amazon apparel and attempt to get them removed when possible.\n\nAmazon drivers do not routinely knock on doors or make homeowners sign for their products- unless that is already pre-arranged.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing and anyone with information on this crime should call Savannah Police directly.\n\nCopyright 2025 WTOC.

            "content": "With family scattered across Canada, Italy, India, and Australia, international travel has become an integral part of my lifestyle. While my go-to airplane snacks and favorite in-flight entertainment remains unchanged, my approach to packing has undergone a transformation now that I only travel with carry-on luggage. I just spent a month abroad with loved ones for the holidays, and I\u2019m still delighting in the memory of how good it felt to bypass the baggage carousel and head straight for customs\u2014one less hurdle between me and the cherished faces waiting for me.\n\nAs both a minimalist and seasoned shopping editor, I\u2019m discerning in how I pack only the most essential items for my suitcase. Prioritizing versatile travel clothing, smart tech, and (most importantly) a set of compression packing cubes, I\u2019ve mastered the art of packing light while still leaving space to do some shopping on my travels\u2014even in the winter, when packing involves chunky sweaters and winter coats. In fact, I\u2019m planning a trip this very (cold) month to Portland\u2019s famous The Docent\u2019s Collection\u2014a luxe hotel alternative well-situated in the heart of the city\u2019s rich historic district. Below, I\u2019ve compiled a selection of my favorite winter travel essentials that will be coming with me\u2014affordable options all under $50\u2014available on Amazon, perfect for navigating trips of any length with ease and efficiency.\n\nAmazon Editor-Loved Carry-On Essentials\n\nBagail Compression Packing Cubes Set\n\nAmazon\n\nThese packing cubes have been a game changer for me because they don\u2019t just organize my clothes; they have a compression zipper that flattens all my plush sweaters, making the most of the limited space my small suitcase offers. Thanks to these, I was able to pack two winter coats, seven thick sweaters, and more.\n\nAmazon Essentials Button-Down Shirt\n\nAmazon\n\nThis versatile button-down became my go-to travel staple this whole year, no matter the season. Whether dressed up with a pair of sleek trousers, casually thrown over a T-shirt, or even used as a cover-up over a bathing suit, the 100 percent cotton shirt is breathable and wrinkle-resistant, making it ideal for long flights and days spent exploring new cities. I own it in pink, blue, and white.\n\nSabani Portable Charger With Cables\n\nAmazon\n\nLong layovers and lengthy sightseeing sessions are no match for this compact powerhouse. The Sabani portable charger comes with built-in cables to keep all my devices powered up through endless hours of travel. It\u2019s sleek, lightweight, and has a charging capacity that can last me an entire day of use. I never had to sacrifice a photo op or navigation app for a low battery.\n\nThe Drop Grayson Drop-Shoulder Turtleneck Sweater\n\nAmazon\n\nThis turtleneck sweater was the perfect balance of warmth and chic vibes. With its soft, cozy knit and relaxed drop-shoulder silhouette, it elevated my casual travel outfits while still feeling comfortable on long flights or chilly evenings abroad. I paired it with fleece pants (more on those below!) for travel days, and then with a little skirt and knee-high boots for nights out.\n\nLanyani RFID Crossbody Wristlet Purse\n\nAmazon\n\nTraveling through crowded airports or bustling city streets, I always felt secure with this compact RFID crossbody wristlet. Not only did it keep my credit cards and passport safe from digital theft, but its minimalist design also meant I could slip it into my jacket pocket when I didn\u2019t need it, giving me peace of mind while keeping my hands free to explore.\n\nAmazon Essentials Teddy Bear Fleece Oversized Coat\n\nAmazon\n\nThis oversized fleece coat was my ultimate comfort companion during chilly travels. Its plush, teddy bear texture made it feel like wearing a blanket while still maintaining a stylish silhouette. The best part? It\u2019s surprisingly lightweight for such a cozy piece, and its neutral tone made it easy to pair with virtually everything in my wardrobe. I loved cozying up with it on my long-haul flight.\n\nBaleaf Fleece-Lined Pants\n\nAmazon\n\nThese fleece-lined pants were an unexpected travel MVP I acquired right before my trip. Soft and stretchy, they offered both warmth and flexibility, whether I was hiking through the Italian mountains side or catching a red-eye flight. I even dressed them up with ankle boots, a turtleneck, and a blazer for an effortlessly chic holiday party look one evening.\n\nFarmacy Best-Sellers Skin Care Set\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen I\u2019m on the go, my dry skin gets extremely parched. That\u2019s where Farmacy\u2019s skincare set stepped in. Its collection of best-sellers (which are also some of my favorite products) kept my skin hydrated with honey-infused formulas that managed to make my skin feel dewy while looking lightweight. The comprehensive set included everything I needed to cleanse and hydrate my skin (and lips!) every morning and night\u2014including on flights.\n\nOribe Gold Lust Repair & Restore Shampoo Conditioner Travel Set\n\nAmazon\n\nI shudder to think about the prospect of borrowing my brother\u2019s three-in-one body wash, shampoo, and conditioner, so I always pack my own hair products when I\u2019m traveling to see family. This Oribe shampoo and conditioner have been my go-to travel hair products for many years, and I always keep them on-hand to keep my dry, fine, and curly hair looking shiny while feeling hydrated.\n\n",

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) ended 2024 on a high note, up 44% in 52 weeks. But more importantly, it's coming into the year with all systems go to leverage its e-commerce platform to gain market share and harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to supercharge its cloud platform.\n\n2025 is starting off strong, but you should buy stocks that have long-term potential. Let's see where Amazon might be five years from now.\n\nE-commerce: Gaining market share\n\nAmazon has been steadily gaining market share in e-commerce over the past few years, and eMarketer expects it to have surpassed 40% of total U.S. e-commerce sales in 2024. It got a lot of competition from smaller companies that went online early in the pandemic, but it has improved its logistics networks and done a lot of other things to reinforce its top position and expand its lead.\n\nIt recently switched from a national to a regional warehouse system, and that's important as physical store chains use their physical footprint as a distribution channel. Both Walmart and Costco Wholesale are leveraging their many stores all over the country to ship orders quickly and cheaply, and they also have the advantage of being able to offer omnichannel options like store pickup that Amazon can't.\n\nInstead, Amazon is doing what it does best: offering the quickest and cheapest delivery options for online orders. The company is also adding tons of products to ensure that its Prime customers continue to rely on it for everything they need.\n\nIt keeps improving speed, which increases the chance that customers will keep using it for their everyday essentials and more, and it's also making efforts to cut costs. Same-day orders increased 25% year over year in the third quarter, and same-day deliveries are also one of its cheapest systems to operate. It recently piloted a new warehouse model in Louisiana that incorporates new robotics technology. It's already cutting processing time by 25%, which should drive a 25% improvement in costs.\n\nIn five years, Amazon should have even more of the e-commerce market, which itself is growing, generating organic growth opportunities. As it gets bigger, growth might slow down.\n\nCloud computing and AI: Accelerating sales\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud computing division, accounts for 31% of the total global cloud market according to Statista. Second-place Microsoft Azure has 20%, and while its lead isn't as dramatic as in e-commerce, it's still hefty.\n\nClients who were budgeting when inflation skyrocketed are spending again, and more importantly, clients who want to get in on generative AI are flocking to AWS' platform.\n\nThat's because Amazon has developed an incredibly powerful AI business that offers all kinds of products and features to meet almost any demand. Management describes it as a three-tier system, with tools for developers to create their own large language models (LLM), its own Bedrock system for midsize enterprises to use Amazon's LLMs, and plug-in solutions for small business clients.\n\nAWS sales growth accelerated in the third quarter to 19% year over year, and generative AI is already a billion-dollar business. However, CEO Andy Jassy thinks it's in its infancy and has massive long-term potential. On December's third-quarter earnings call, he said, \"It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\"\n\nIn five years, AWS should still be growing at a fast pace. It also accounts for most of Amazon's operating income -- 62% in the third quarter -- and it should help Amazon expand its margins.\n\nStreaming: Staying competitive\n\nStreaming isn't the first thing people usually think of when they think of Amazon, because Amazon is so much more. But it's still competitive in streaming, and it owns MGM Studios, providing it with first-rate content that rivals the other big players.\n\nIt has the rights to Thursday Night Football, and the Cowboys-Giants game in the third quarter was the most-streamed regular season football game ever. It also has highly rated series like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\n\nIt recently rolled out an ad-supported tier like Netflix and Walt Disney, combined with a robust advertising business to generate new opportunities in the ad business.\n\nIn five years, Amazon should be able to stay competitive, adding new content, beefing up the ad part, and potentially making another acquisition.\n\nEverything else\n\nThe ad business has been Amazon's fastest-growing operation for a while. Having access to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members, who are all online to shop, is a huge benefit for advertisers. Amazon's data-rich, AI-based system also gives advertisers the tools to succeed.\n\nAmazon is constantly acquiring new companies while launching new products and businesses to create more sales opportunities. It's investing in healthcare and its pharmacy business, and it's made several acquisitions over the past few years.\n\nIt recently acquired AI company Anthropic, and I expect that its coming rollouts and acquisitions will also be focused on growing the AI business.\n\nWhat about Amazon stock?\n\nAmazon stock beat the market in 2024, and it's well positioned to do it again this year. Even though it's already made millionaires, this company still has incredible growth prospects. It may not be the same as a young upstart, but it also comes with less risk. Amazon stock should amply reward investors over the next five years.",

Design highlights include two sliding glass doors that flood the interior with natural light and an outdoor spiral staircase that connects the spacious porch with a beautiful rooftop terrace.

            "content": "Meta and Amazon scale back diversity initiatives\n\n11 January 2025 Natalie Sherman BBC News\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeta and Amazon are scaling back their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are retreating from hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The moves come shortly after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff, Meta said it was also scrapping its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts due to a \"shifting legal and policy landscape\". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other firms to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election.\n\nIn its memo, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term \"DEI\" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become \"charged\". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but stop using its current procedure, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates.\n\nAmazon said in its internal announcement that it remained \"dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences\" but was altering its approach to focus on programmes with \"proven outcomes\". \"As part of this evolution, we've been winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024,\" Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the December note to staff, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The changes include unifying \"employee groups\" under one umbrella, she said. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of \"woke\" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are \"diverse\" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering \"equity and inclusion\" training and instead offer programmes that \"mitigate bias for all, no matter your background\". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration.\n\n\"I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this,\" said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been \"directly tied to long-term business growth\". \"Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders\" RaShawn \"Shawnie\" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said.",

            "content": "Amazon said it is halting some of its diversity and inclusion initiatives, joining a growing list of major corporations that have made similar moves in the face of increasing public and legal scrutiny.\n\nIn a Dec. 16 internal note to staffers that was obtained by CNBC, Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, said the company was in the process of \"winding down outdated programs and materials\" as part of a broader review of hundreds of initiatives.\n\n\"Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2014 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture,\" Castleberry wrote in the note, which was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nCastleberry's memo doesn't say which programs the company is dropping as a result of its review. The company typically releases annual data on the racial and gender makeup of its workforce, and it also operates Black, LGBTQ+, indigenous and veteran employee resource groups, among others.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon set a goal of doubling the number of Black employees in vice president and director roles. It announced the same goal in 2021 and also pledged to hire 30% more Black employees for product manager, engineer and other corporate roles.\n\nMeta on Friday made a similar retreat from its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The social media company said it's ending its approach of considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups for open roles and its equity and inclusion training programs. The decision drew backlash from Meta employees, including one staffer who wrote, \"If you don't stand by your principles when things get difficult, they aren't values. They're hobbies.\"\n\nOther companies, including McDonald's , Walmart and Ford , have also made changes to their DEI initiatives in recent months. Rising conservative backlash and the Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action in 2023 spurred many corporations to alter or discontinue their DEI programs.\n\nAmazon, which is the nation's second-largest private employer behind Walmart, also recently made changes to its \"Our Positions\" webpage, which lays out the company's stance on a variety of policy issues. Previously, there were separate sections dedicated to \"Equity for Black people,\" \"Diversity, equity and inclusion\" and \"LGBTQ+ rights,\" according to records from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.\n\nThe current webpage has streamlined those sections into a single paragraph. The section says that Amazon believes in creating a diverse and inclusive company and that inequitable treatment of anyone is unacceptable. The Information earlier reported the changes.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told CNBC in a statement: \"We update this page from time to time to ensure that it reflects updates we've made to various programs and positions.\"\n\nRead the full memo from Amazon's Castleberry:\n\nTeam,\n\nAs we head toward the end of the year, I want to give another update on the work we've been doing around representation and inclusion.\n\nAs a large, global company that operates in different countries and industries, we serve hundreds of millions of customers from a range of backgrounds and globally diverse communities. To serve them effectively, we need millions of employees and partners that reflect our customers and communities. We strive to be representative of those customers and build a culture that's inclusive for everyone.\n\nIn the last few years we took a new approach, reviewing hundreds of programs across the company, using science to evaluate their effectiveness, impact, and ROI \u2014 identifying the ones we believed should continue. Each one of these addresses a specific disparity, and is designed to end when that disparity is eliminated. In parallel, we worked to unify employee groups together under one umbrella, and build programs that are open to all. Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2014 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture. You can read more about this on our Together at Amazon page on A to Z.\n\nThis approach \u2014 where we move away from programs that were separate from our existing processes, and instead integrating our work into existing processes so they become durable \u2014 is the evolution to \"built in\" and \"born inclusive,\" instead of \"bolted on.\" As part of this evolution, we've been winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024. We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don't align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we'll keep at it.\n\nWe'll continue to share ongoing updates, and appreciate your hard work in driving this progress. We believe this is important work, so we'll keep investing in programs that help us reflect those audiences, help employees grow, thrive, and connect, and we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.\n\n#InThisTogether,\n\nCandi",

            "content": "Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announces two new Amazon Just Walk Out authentication products, making Just Walk Out implementation more applicable for a wider range of retailer use cases. The new modular authentication pedestals now allow retailers to use their preferred payment processors at Just Walk Out stores and give retailers flexibility to easily add or remove authentication hardware in under a few hours to best meet their shoppers\u2019 payment needs. Also, retailers can now use door authorization to convert existing spaces with standard doors into Just Walk Out stores without the need for gate lanes, reducing footprint requirements and construction costs while maintaining control of store access.\n\nJust Walk Out uses a combination of AI, computer vision, sensors, and RFID to eliminate traditional checkout lines. This creates a fast and seamless shopper experience while increasing retailers\u2019 sales and lowering their operational costs.\n\nAbout modular authentication pedestals\n\nModular authentication pedestals, placed at either store entry or exit, let retailers use their preferred payment processor(s) \u2014 this lets retailers maintain existing payment terms and install card readers supported by their preferred payment processors within a few hours. This flexibility also extends to other authentication pedestal hardware, allowing retailers to mix and match authentication methods to best-fit different shopper needs: For example, a retailer launching a grab-and-go university Just Walk Out store could first install modular pedestals with QR code and credit card readers, then easily remove the QR reader and add an RFID badge reader to support authentication with student IDs. Similarly, a retailer could switch their preferred payment processor by only replacing the card readers, without added fiddling with the authentication pedestals.\n\nAs part of this launch, we are excited to integrate with Adyen, a leading global payment provider, and Shift4, a leading US payment provider in sports and hospitality. These integrations further increase retailer and shopper payment flexibility. Through the Adyen UK integration, Just Walk Out now also supports American Express outside of the US\u2014for the first time.\n\nModular pedestals with support for Shift4 via PAX card reader (left) and Adyen via Verifone (right)\n\nLevy, a restaurant and hospitality company specializing in providing food and beverage to major entertainment and sports venues, has implemented modular authentication pedestals in recent stores.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used Just Walk Out\u2019s modular authentication pedestals in our newest locations, making it fast and simple to get the stores up and running. We were able to get the authentication pedestals installed and operating within days. Plus, our customers have been delighted by the simple entry experience, finding it intuitive and easy to enter our stores,\u201d said Harry Ridley, Head of Technology, Levy.\n\nAbout door authorization\n\nDoor authorization lets retailers convert existing spaces with doors into Just Walk Out stores in less time and at lower cost than before. By connecting authentication pedestals to a standard door instead of gate lanes, retailers can more easily add Just Walk Out technology into existing retail spaces and operate them 24\u00d77 without needing labor to check out shoppers. Shoppers simply authenticate their payment method at the door to gain access, then shop freely within the store. Just Walk Out\u2019s AI-powered technology automatically tracks items in each shopper\u2019s virtual cart as they take or return items. When they are done with their trip, shoppers simply exit through the door and are charged for any purchases.\n\nDoor authorization (left) compared to standard Just Walk Out gate lanes (right)\n\nIONNA, a fast-charging network for electric vehicles, will offer secure access to their autonomous convenience stores with Just Walk Out\u2019s new door authentication.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give our charging customers the convenience of seamless, high quality, and fast shopping with autonomous stores at our IONNA Electric Vehicle Charging Stations\u201d, said Ricardo Stamatti, Chief Product Officer of IONNA. \u201cDoor authorization meant we could take a standard pre-fabricated structure, convert it into a Just Walk Out store, and deploy at an IONNA Rechargery in record time. Giving drivers the amenities they crave, enabled by Just Walk Out\u2019s accurate sales of food & beverage items, and without the need of a full-time attendant at checkout. Ultimately, we chose to work with Just Walk Out over other providers because Amazon provided the right technology, scale, reliability, and joint vision of the future that others couldn\u2019t. We\u2019re excited to open our first three Rechargeries using Just Walk Out\u2019s vision technology in 2025.\n\nExample render of a pre-fabricated Just Walk Out store\n\nExtending Just Walk Out technology beyond convenience\n\nBeyond providing a fast and convenient shopper experience, Just Walk Out technology transforms how retailers operate their stores and serve their shoppers. By eliminating traditional checkout lines, retailers have seen both topline and operational improvements across their stores in a variety of verticals, such as education and sports. As one example, University of California San Diego (UCSD) implemented Just Walk Out and saw an ~19% lift in peak shoppers served per hour (~11% boost in total guest count) and successfully re-allocated ~30% of labor to support other critical needs. The sports and entertainment sector has seen similar success. Todd Humphrey, SVP of Digital Innovation and Fan Experience for the Seattle Kraken, shared an enthusiastic response from their fans.\n\n\u201cThe fans have spoken, too, and they\u2019re thrilled,\u201d he said. \u201cMy favorite comment that I\u2019ve seen is \u2018I got my beer in eight seconds!\u2019\u201d\n\nJust Walk Out\u2019s extensive network of certified partners makes it straightforward for retailers to bring this experience to their stores. Certified partners handle everything from initial project management and store design to procurement and installation, ensuring a fast and smooth transition to autonomous retail, with expert support throughout the process.\n\nLearn more\n\nWill you be at NRF?

            "content": "A bit past noon on a balmy, rain-thick day in October, I knock on the door of a tumbledown building in the Brazilian port of Bel\u00e9m and ascend a narrow flight of wooden stairs. It took barely 20 minutes to walk here through the city\u2019s historic center, but by the time I arrive at Iacitata Amaz\u00f4nia Viva, I have already broken into an inevitable equatorial sweat. Inside the restaurant and cultural center, floor fans whir by a pair of French doors flung open over a canopy of mango trees. A leaden sky mirrors the hammered-\u00adpewter \u00adsurface of Guajar\u00e1 Bay, barely visible beyond the terracotta roof of a fortress built by the Portuguese more than 400 years ago to guard the southern flank of the Amazon Delta. Books and banners line the walls, cozy in hues of butcher\u2019s paper and wheat germ, like a coffee shop in a progressive college town. \u201cChange Your Consumption, Not the Climate,\u201d one poster exhorts. Another declares: \u201cCooking is a Revolutionary Act.\u201d\n\nI settle at a rickety table by the \u00adwindow and order the nine-course tasting, a somewhat misleading term for the brisk, unfussy meal that follows. First comes a soup of jungle herbs sweated into a steaming broth of tucupi, a bracing ferment of cassava juice. Pungent with garlic vine and alive with the numbing tingle of the native herb jamb\u00fa, the soup is earthy and acerbic, as if one had distilled vinegar from mushrooms: the flavors of the Amazon concentrated in a few energizing mouthfuls. There are morsels of water buffalo fried in their own tallow and snow-white beiju, roundels of cassava flour crisped in a pan. Chile-rubbed \u00adfilhote, a type of Amazonian catfish, comes poached in the fermented juice of the tucum\u00e3 palm fruit, nutty and dense and taut with acidity. Sweet and delicate shrimp from the nearby estuary bend like coral around a small bowl of piracu\u00ed, a candy floss of salt-dried fish common to the riverine communities deep in the rural interior of Par\u00e1, the immense state whose capital is Bel\u00e9m.\n\nFishing boats lined up at the Ver-o-Peso port in the city of Bel\u00e9m. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nAs dish after thrilling dish arrives at my table, the restaurant\u2019s owner, cook and activist Tain\u00e1 Marajoara, \u00adricochets across the creaky floors, fleet and focused as a hummingbird. When we\u2019d spoken by video call a few weeks \u00adearlier, she\u2019d spent an hour railing against industrial agriculture in the Amazon and the hypocrisy of urban elites who swoon over Amazonian ingredients as the rainforest burns. She vehemently decried what she described as the predominant attitude among Brazilian chefs: \u201cthat the food of dark-skinned people needs to be updated, as though we don\u2019t have a wisdom and aesthetic of our own.\u201d Geometric patterns marked her face, a traditional practice for First Peoples across the Amazon, vivid even through the pixelated haze of a laptop screen.\n\nIn the days to come, we would have several conversations in which she would lambaste fellow chefs (though never by name) as corporate shills, government lackeys, and opportunistic thieves, her anger infectious and raw. Today, though, when she alights at my table, it is with an open smile and a small bowl of mani\u00e7oba, made by boiling manioc, or cassava, leaves for several days to sublimate their toxic cyanogens. Reduced to a lush green pottage and fried briefly with smoked pork and sausage\u2014a European incursion on an Indigenous delicacy\u2014it tastes, magnificently, like the forest floor. If Amazonian cuisine has a single emblematic dish, it would be mani\u00e7oba: a caustic ingredient transformed throughpatience and observation, an ancient technology reshaped by history but never erased. \u201cThese are unconquerable flavors,\u201d Marajoara tells me that afternoon, dazzling and defiant. \u201cEven after centuries, they\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nBoiled manioc leaves for mani\u00e7oba. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nGrowing up in Bel\u00e9m, Marajoara spent countless hours in the kitchen with her grandparents and great-grandmother preparing dinners for large groups of friends and family. Many were visitors from the vast river island of Maraj\u00f3, an expanse of savannahs and seasonal lakes where Marajoara\u2019s family traces its roots. They would make the trek bearing ingredients from home as tokens of appreciation: mild cheeses made from the milk of water buffalo (introduced in the late 19th century), or jars of larvae extracted from the nut of the tucum\u00e3 palm.\n\nFor almost a millennium, Maraj\u00f3, supported one of the most advanced pre-Colombian societies east of the Andes. Beginning around 400 C.E., a cluster of sovereign chiefdoms erected massive earthworks to protect their settlements from seasonal floods, excavated lakes that would capture fish when the waters receded, and crafted polychrome ceramics of extraordinary formal refinement. Despite this, many right-wing Brazilians choose to frame Indigenous peoples as recent occupants of the Amazon\u2014unable to exploit the forest\u2019s untold resources, and with no rights to claim them. Yet, Dr. Sidiana da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o Ferreira de Mac\u00eado, a food historian at the Federal University of Par\u00e1, says, \u201cWe have archaeological evidence of the domestication of cassava that goes back [over] 10,000 years.\u201d For millennia, those same communities developed fertile terra preta, or \u201cdark earth,\u201d soils to raise crops and cultivate fruit trees. In 2023, laser mapping found at least 900 geometric structures scattered across the Amazon, further proof of widespread human intervention.\n\nWhen the Portuguese made landfall in Maraj\u00f3 in the early 17th century, they encountered a patchwork of more than two dozen nomadic tribes. Despite studies showing a preponderance of Native blood in the island\u2019s gene pool today, historical consensus has long held that Maraj\u00f3\u2019s native lineages ended shortly thereafter, subsumed into the bloodlines of European invaders and the Black people they enslaved. Marajoara, who identifies as a member of the Aru\u00e3 Marajoara nation, grew up hearing that the \u201cMarajoara\u201d didn\u2019t even exist.\n\nWater buffalo graze in Soure, Maraj\u00f3. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nToday, Maraj\u00f3 ranks among the poorest regions in Brazil. Riverine communities and quilombos\u2014a term for settlements founded as early as the 16th century by resistors to Brazil\u2019s regime of \u00adenslavement\u2014subsist on fishing, farming, and hunting, and are broadly cut off from basic infrastructure for health and education. Many flock to informal settlements at Bel\u00e9m\u2019s tattered edges, hastily assimilating into the city\u2019s mestizo majority. Virtually no one from Maraj\u00f3, neither on the island nor in the diaspora, identifies as Indigenous. And while Marajoara\u2019s family in Bel\u00e9m may not have described themselves as such, in her house, \u201cwe learned the old songs, the old medicine, how to make our own fishing nets and utensils,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was born into that Indigenous culture and knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Marajoara and her husband, Carlos Ruffeil, moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, more than 1,500 miles south of Bel\u00e9m, where she would pursue a master\u2019s degree in oral history. By then, Amazonian food had become a \u00adshibboleth for culinary tastemakers. Chefs from Bel\u00e9m, such as Paulo Martins and Ofir Oliveira, started promoting their city\u2019s mestizo-Amazonian cuisine as early as the 1970s, but it wasn\u2019t until 1999, when chef Alex Atala opened his much-f\u00eated fine dining restaurant D.O.M., that city dwellers in Brazil\u2019s affluent south turned their attention to the rainforest. A born-and-bred Paulistano educated in Europe, Atala framed himself as an intrepid explorer of a lost culinary frontier. \u201cAmazonian food had become a spectacle,\u201d Marajoara laments, tweezed and corseted to meet Eurocentric standards, largely divorced from the cultures that had nurtured it into existence.\n\nChef Tain\u00e1 Marajora at Iacitata: Amaz\u00f4nia Viva. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nMarajoara and Ruffeil flew back to Bel\u00e9m regularly, traveling deep into Par\u00e1\u2019s rural backcountry to \u00addocument its disappearing foodways for a research project called CATA, or Cultura Alimentar Tradicional Amaz\u00f4nica (Traditional Amazonian Food Culture). Marajoara hadn\u2019t visited Maraj\u00f3 since the late 1980s, when her grandmother died in a ferry accident between the island and Bel\u00e9m. Afterward, her great-grandmother, whom she describes as \u201ca guardian of traditional knowledge,\u201d forbade her from visiting her ancestral home until, she was told, \u201clife calls you back.\u201d After nearly 20 years, it finally had.\n\nWhen she returned to Maraj\u00f3 in 2009, Marajoara found the island radically changed. Some shifts were inadvertent consequences of successful initiatives such as the 2003 Bolsa Familia program, which alleviated acute hunger through direct cash infusions to nearly 14 million families across Brazil. (By 2023, the revived program had reached more than 21 million families.) According to Mariana Inglez dos Reis, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo whose research focuses on nutrition in western Maraj\u00f3, \u201cMothers and fathers who remember being hungry as children say that things are much better now.\u201d But, she adds, increased income, practically useless in remote villages with limited access to refrigeration, tends to push those families to urban areas where they use their subsidies on processed convenience foods, which has complicated health outcomes. Throughout Par\u00e1, Marajoara and Ruffeil heard countless tales of dwindling fish stocks and fruit trees replaced by industrial monocultures. Many communities had abandoned their ancestral crops in favor of processed foods, each tin of fruit or beans an imperishable token of a nebulous modernity.\n\nEarly morning in Barra Velha beach in Soure, Maraj\u00f3. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nOther changes were more nefarious: In 2011, the government of Par\u00e1 invited the politically powerful Quartiero family, rice growers who had spent at least a decade clashing violently with Indigenous peoples over land disputes in the neighboring state of Roraima, to establish rice plantations in eastern Maraj\u00f3. \u201cThey promised us development and employment, but at the end of the day, they brought machines and workers from elsewhere,\u201d says Rosivaldo Moraes Correas, a leader of the Quilombo Gurup\u00e1, one of the communities directly affected. Correas recalls seeing baby howler monkeys stranded on roadsides, and lakes and streams drained and diverted to feed the paddies. Farmers, he says, sprayed pesticides that contaminated the water and detonated explosives to scare away wild ducks, which people in Maraj\u00f3 would braise in tucupi during the rainy season. Tellingly, this delicacy is still popular at restaurants in Bel\u00e9m, but is increasingly difficult to come by in its place of origin.\n\nMarajoara, meanwhile, became involved in a growing network of activists, thinkers, traditional cooks, and community collectives, among them the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement, which, since the 1980s, has expropriated unproductive plots held by wealthy landowners and used them for food production. Over the years, the network made steady strides. In 2010, the Brazilian legislature passed a constitutional amendment that guaranteed food security as a \u201csocial right.\u201d Three years later, Marajoara went as a delegate to the third National Conference of Culture, where cultura alimentar, literally \u201cfood culture,\u201d a concept she\u2019d championed since the first days of CATA, was formally recognized as a protected element of Brazil\u2019s cultural heritage, equal to music, dance, literature, and craft. Still, violence against activists persisted: In August 2013, days after filing complaints against the destructive rice farmers in Maraj\u00f3, then-president of Quilombo Gurup\u00e1 Teodoro Lalor de Lima was stabbed to death in Bel\u00e9m, one of 342 environmentalists assassinated in Brazil between 2012 and 2022, according to a study from the NGO Global Witness.\n\nFilhote fish poached in tucum\u00e3 with cassava flour beiju. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nAnd in May 2016\u2014the same month that Atala lauded Amazonian ingredients on the second season of \u201cChef\u2019s Table,\u201d and barely six months after UNESCO declared Bel\u00e9m a \u201cCreative City of Gastronomy\u201d\u2014the state of Par\u00e1 inaugurated the Belo Monte Dam, a hydroelectric power source that has devastated the fishing and foraging grounds of nearby Indigenous reserves while displacing thousands of inhabitants. The 2018 election of Jair Bolsonaro, who disbanded the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security, only reified condescending attitudes toward Indigenous peoples that had made such destruction possible. \u201cThe Indians do not speak our language, they do not have money, they do not have culture,\u201d he said in a 2015 interview, even as science had long upheld that, without those cultures, the Amazon as we know it today would not exist.\n\nFor Marajoara, such contradictions raise a crushing, urgent question: \u201cWhy is our culture being massacred if you value our food?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Amazon were just a great market of \u2018exotic\u2019 ingredients. But if the Amazon is alive, it\u2019s because its people are alive.\u201d\n\nJer\u00f4nima Barbosa de Brito at her farm on Maraj\u00f3. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nA few days after my first meal at Iacitata, I board the fast ferry from Bel\u00e9m to Maraj\u00f3, where I disembark in the town of Soure and make my way to Fazenda S\u00e3o Jer\u00f4nimo. The farm\u2019s matriarch, Jer\u00f4nima Barbosa de Brito, has invited me for a traditional lunch: chorizo-\u00adstudded mani\u00e7oba, fish poached in a tucupi as delicate as dashi, and lustrous postprandial pours of a\u00e7ai (arguably Par\u00e1\u2019s most prized export), served as an unsweetened pur\u00e9e, \u00adtrenchant, bitter, and cool. First, though, I watch her nimble fingers strip silken membranes from a pearlescent tangle of turu, ribbon-like bivalves extracted from the rotten trunks of fallen mangroves. Though turu has been a free, readily available form of sustenance for generations, attitudes have since shifted. Isabel Brito, a sociologist and Dona Jer\u00f4nima\u2019s daughter, says, \u201ca lot of society here looks down on it\u201d as an ingredient fit only for poor scavengers.\n\nThe Britos do not identify as Indigenous, but Isabel sees her family as participating in the same fight as other land-rights activists. Turu, like crabs and tucum\u00e3, form part of \u201ca very rich culture around the economy of the mangrove,\u201d Brito tells me. This ecosystem has long sustained the fishermen of coastal Maraj\u00f3, \u201cwhich is why it\u2019s so important to recuperate our pride in these traditions,\u201d she adds. But as long as tradition is equated with poverty, exogenous high-yield crops such as oil palm and soy, both of which require dangerous agrotoxins to thrive, will look to many like progress. Activist Marionede Juruna, a friend of Marajoara and one of those affected by the construction of the Belo Monte Dam, tells me on my final night in Bel\u00e9m: \u201cCultura alimentar is more than just food. It\u2019s recovering our memories, preserving our way of planting and growing and cooking\u2014our entire way of life.\u201d\n\nJamb\u00fa for sale at Ver-O-Peso market in Bel\u00e9m. (Photo: Alessandro Falco)\n\nThat process of recovery is already underway. Where the 2010 census counted fewer than a million Indigenous people nationwide, in 2022 that number nearly doubled, thanks in part to the census bureau\u2019s decision to pose the question of Native identity to people not only in protected territories but in cities across the country. For Marajoara, who recalls being told that she \u201cwas a false Indigenous person because I\u2019m from the city,\u201d that simple change is a vindication. The morning after I return from Maraj\u00f3, she tells me, \u201cJust because you\u2019re born in a city does not mean your Indigenous identity is shut off.\u201d\n\nBack at Iacitata, Marajoara joins me with a modest dessert. Buffalo-milk cheese from Maraj\u00f3 is slathered with a deep mauve jam made from cupua\u00e7u, a cousin of cacao that tastes of passionfruit and leather, all dusted with a flurry of grated Brazil nuts. This simple dish is a palimpsest of cultures and histories embedded in the region\u2019s fluvial soil: an emblematic product of Maraj\u00f3, made using milk from an animal introduced less than 150 years ago, combined with endemic cupua\u00e7u and Brazil nuts. It makes no claim to cultural purity. It\u2019s offhand and elegant, elemental and dynamic. Cooking like this may or may not be a revolutionary act, but it is an optimistic one. Flavors like these matter most when there\u2019s someone there to tell you that they taste like home.\n\nRecipe",

            "content": "As organizations navigate the complexities of the digital realm, generative AI has emerged as a transformative force, empowering enterprises to enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and drive innovation. To maximize the value of insights generated by generative AI, it is crucial to provide simple ways for users to preserve and share these insights using commonly used tools such as email.\n\nAmazon Q Business is a generative AI-powered assistant that can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in your enterprise systems. It is redefining the way businesses approach data-driven decision-making, content generation, and secure task management. By using the custom plugin capability of Amazon Q Business, you can extend its functionality to support sending emails directly from Amazon Q applications, allowing you to store and share the valuable insights gleaned from your conversations with this powerful AI assistant.\n\nAmazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is an email service provider that provides a simple, cost-effective way for you to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains. Amazon SES offers many email tools, including email sender configuration options, email deliverability tools, flexible email deployment options, sender and identity management, email security, email sending statistics, email reputation dashboard, and inbound email services.\n\nThis post explores how you can integrate Amazon Q Business with Amazon SES to email conversations to specified email addresses.\n\nSolution overview\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nThe workflow includes the following steps:\n\nIn the following sections, we walk through the steps to deploy and test the solution. This solution is supported only in the us-east-1 AWS Region.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nComplete the following prerequisites:\n\nDeploy the solution resources\n\nIn this step, we use a CloudFormation template to deploy a Lambda function, configure the REST API, and create identities. Complete the following steps:\n\nOpen the AWS CloudFormation console in the us-east-1 Choose Create stack. Download the CloudFormation template and upload it in the Specify template Choose Next.\n\nFor Stack name, enter a name (for example, QIntegrationWithSES ). In the Parameters section, provide the following: For IDCInstanceArn, enter your IAM Identity Center instance ARN. For LambdaName, enter the name of your Lambda function. For Fromemailaddress, enter the address to send email. For Toemailaddress, enter the address to receive email. Choose Next.\n\nKeep the other values as default and select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources in the Capabilities Choose Submit to create the CloudFormation stack. After the successful deployment of the stack, on the Outputs tab, make a note of the value for apiGatewayInvokeURL . You will need this later to create a custom plugin.\n\nVerification emails will be sent to the Toemailaddress and Fromemailaddress values provided as input to the CloudFormation template.\n\nVerify the newly created email identities using the link in the email.\n\nThis post doesn\u2019t cover auto scaling of Lambda functions. For more information about how to integrate Lambda with Application Auto Scaling, see AWS Lambda and Application Auto Scaling.\n\nTo configure AWS WAF on API Gateway, refer to Use AWS WAF to protect your REST APIs in API Gateway.\n\nThis is sample code, for non-production usage. You should work with your security and legal teams to meet your organizational security, regulatory, and compliance requirements before deployment.\n\nCreate Amazon Cognito users\n\nThis solution uses Amazon Cognito to authorize users to make a call to API Gateway. The CloudFormation template creates a new Amazon Cognito user pool.\n\nComplete the following steps to create a user in the newly created user pool and capture information about the user pool:\n\nOn the AWS CloudFormation console, navigate to the stack you created. On the Resources tab, choose the link next to the physical ID for CognitoUserPool .\n\nOn the Amazon Cognito console, choose User management and users in the navigation pane. Choose Create user. Enter an email address and password of your choice, then choose Create user.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Applications and app clients. Capture the client ID and client secret. You will need these later during custom plugin development. On the Login pages tab, copy the values for Allowed callback URLs. You will need these later during custom plugin development. In the navigation pane, choose Branding. Capture the Amazon Cognito domain. You will need this information to update OpenAPI specifications.\n\nUpload documents to Amazon S3\n\nThis solution uses the fully managed Amazon S3 data source to seamlessly power a RAG workflow, eliminating the need for custom integration and data flow management.\n\nFor this post, we use sample articles to upload to Amazon S3. Complete the following steps:\n\nOn the AWS CloudFormation console, navigate to the stack you created. On the Resources tab, choose the link for the physical ID of AmazonQDataSourceBucket .\n\nUpload the sample articles file to the S3 bucket. For instructions, see Uploading objects.\n\nAdd users to the Amazon Q Business application\n\nComplete the following steps to add users to the newly created Amazon Q business application:\n\nOn the Amazon Q Business console, choose Applications in the navigation pane. Choose the application you created using the CloudFormation template. Under User access, choose Manage user access.\n\nOn the Manage access and subscriptions page, choose Add groups and users.\n\nSelect Assign existing users and groups, then choose Next. Search for your IAM Identity Center user group.\n\nChoose the group and choose Assign to add the group and its users. Make sure that the current subscription is Q Business Pro. Choose Confirm.\n\nSync Amazon Q data sources\n\nTo sync the data source, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Q Business console, navigate to your application. Choose Data Sources under Enhancements in the navigation pane. From the Data sources list, select the data source you created through the CloudFormation template. Choose Sync now to sync the data source.\n\nIt takes some time to sync with the data source. Wait until the sync status is Completed.\n\nCreate an Amazon Q custom plugin\n\nIn this section, you create the Amazon Q custom plugin for sending emails. Complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Q Business console, navigate to your application. Under Enhancements in the navigation pane, choose Plugins. Choose Add plugin.\n\nChoose Create custom plugin. For Plugin name, enter a name (for example, email-plugin ). For Description, enter a description. Select Define with in-line OpenAPI schema editor.\n\nYou can also upload API schemas to Amazon S3 by choosing Select from S3. That would be the best way to upload for production use cases.\n\nYour API schema must have an API description, structure, and parameters for your custom plugin.\n\nSelect JSON for the schema format. Enter the following schema, providing your API Gateway invoke URL and Amazon Cognito domain URL:\n\n{ \"openapi\": \"3.0.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Send Email API\", \"description\": \"API to send email from SES\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" }, \"servers\": [ { \"url\": \" < API Gateway Invoke URL > \" } ], \"paths\": { \"/\": { \"post\": { \"summary\": \"send email to the user and returns the success message\", \"description\": \"send email to the user and returns the success message\", \"security\": [ { \"OAuth2\": [ \"email/read\" ] } ], \"requestBody\": { \"required\": true, \"content\": { \"application/json\": { \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/sendEmailRequest\" } } } }, \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"Successful response\", \"content\": { \"application/json\": { \"schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/sendEmailResponse\" } } } } } } } }, \"components\": { \"schemas\": { \"sendEmailRequest\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"required\": [ \"emailContent\", \"toEmailAddress\", \"fromEmailAddress\" ], \"properties\": { \"emailContent\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Body of the email.\" }, \"toEmailAddress\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"To email address.\" }, \"fromEmailAddress\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"To email address.\" } } }, \"sendEmailResponse\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"message\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Success or failure message.\" } } } }, \"securitySchemes\": { \"OAuth2\": { \"type\": \"oauth2\", \"description\": \"OAuth2 client credentials flow.\", \"flows\": { \"authorizationCode\": { \"authorizationUrl\": \" <Cognito Domain> /oauth2/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \" <Cognito Domain> /oauth2/token\", \"scopes\": { \"email/read\": \"read the email\" } } } } } } }\n\nUnder Authentication, select Authentication required. For AWS Secrets Manager secret, choose Create and add new secret.\n\nIn the Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret pop-up, enter the following values captured earlier from Amazon Cognito: Client ID Client secret OAuth callback URL\n\nFor Choose a method to authorize Amazon Q Business, leave the default selection as Create and use a new service role. Choose Add plugin to add your plugin.\n\nWait for the plugin to be created and the build status to show as Ready.\n\nThe maximum size of an OpenAPI schema in JSON or YAML is 1 MB.\n\nTo maximize accuracy with the Amazon Q Business custom plugin, follow the best practices for configuring OpenAPI schema definitions for custom plugins.\n\nTest the solution\n\nTo test the solution, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Q Business console, navigate to your application. In the Web experience settings section, find the deployed URL. Open the web experience deployed URL. Use the credentials of the user created earlier in IAM Identity Center to log in to the web experience.\n\nChoose the desired multi-factor authentication (MFA) device to register. For more information, see Register an MFA device for users. After you log in to the web portal, choose the appropriate application to open the chat interface.\n\nIn the Amazon Q portal, enter \u201csummarize attendance and leave policy of the company.\u201d\n\nAmazon Q Business provides answers to your questions from the uploaded documents.\n\nYou can now email this conversation using the custom plugin built earlier.\n\nOn the options menu (three vertical dots), choose Use a Plugin to see the email-plugin created earlier.\n\nChoose email-plugin and enter \u201cEmail the summary of this conversation.\u201d Amazon Q will ask you to provide the email address to send the conversation. Provide the verified identity configured as part of the CloudFormation template.\n\nAfter you enter your email address, the authorization page appears. Enter your Amazon Cognito user email ID and password to authenticate and choose Sign in.\n\nThis step verifies that you\u2019re an authorized user.\n\nThe email will be sent to the specified inbox.\n\nYou can further personalize the emails by using email templates.\n\nSecuring the solution\n\nSecurity is a shared responsibility model between you and AWS and is described as security of the cloud vs. security in the cloud. Keep in mind the following best practices:\n\nBy combining these security measures, you can create a robust and trustworthy application that protects both your business and your customers\u2019 information.\n\nClean up\n\nTo avoid incurring future charges, delete the resources that you created and clean up your account. Complete the following steps:\n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of Amazon Q Business, a state-of-the-art generative AI-powered assistant, with Amazon SES, a robust email service provider, unlocks new possibilities for businesses to harness the power of generative AI.

The pioneering online retailer launched its Amazon Autos property last month with Hyundai as its partner to bring \u201cthe simplicity and ease customers expect from Amazon to car shopping,\u201d according to Amazon Autos head Fan Jin.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d campaign, Hyundai will highlight the simplicity of the purchase process in a mini-campaign series called \u201cIn the Time it Takes.\u201d The secondary campaign, which will run on digital and social channels beginning in mid-January, will demonstrate various scenarios that should be simple but take longer than expected (such as finding a remote or teaching parents new slang terms). Those activities will be contrasted with the simplicity of purchasing a Hyundai via Amazon Autos.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration allows customers to conveniently discover, learn about, and purchase their preferred Hyundai model from their local dealer through one of the world's most trusted shopping experiences,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, in a release. \u201cIt represents the future of automotive retail and our commitment to redefining how cars are marketed and purchased.\u201d\n\nThe integrated effort was developed with Hyundai\u2019s creative agency of record Innocean USA, with Canvas cooridinating the media buys.\n\nThrough Amazon Autos, consumers in 54 markets (representing 71% of Hyundai\u2019s sales volume), can browse and search for vehicles, get a valuation for a trade-in of their existing vehicle, secure financing and schedule a pick-up time at their local dealership through Amazon\u2019s interface. The platform also includes Amazon\u2019s familiar features, including product reviews, seller/dealership reviews, an \u201cadd to cart\u201d button and simple checkout.\n\nThe availability of its vehicles on Amazon Autos and the campaign are the first major efforts under Hyundai Motor America\u2019s new CMO Sean Gilpin, who took the position in August after Angela Zepeda departed the company following an internal reorganization to become global head of marketing at X. Previously, Gilpin had been vice president of global sales and marketing for Hyundai Motor Company since July 2023.",

            "content": "Amazon has unveiled a new offering \u2014 the Retail Ad Service \u2014 which will allow any retailer to easily offer advertising on their digital platforms using the same technology that powers ads on Amazon.com.\n\nThe service, which is built on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure, enables online retailers to show product ads on their search, browse and product pages. Customers that click on an ad complete their purchase in the retailer\u2019s online store. The service is currently in beta with multiple retailers, including iHerb, Oriental Trading Company and Weee!, and will launch with Tilly\u2019s, as well as other retailers, soon.\n\nA New Take on Retail Media\n\nThe new offering could be incredibly disruptive to the rapidly evolving world of retail media. Amazon already captures more than three-quarters of the U.S. retail media market, in large part due to its head start; in fact, some would argue Amazon actually started it all when it launched its advertising platform in 2012.\n\nNow, Amazon is giving retailers (many of which have launched their own competitive media networks in recent years) plug-and-play access to its advanced technology in order to easily launch their own media offering. In exchange, Amazon will take a portion of the ad revenue, as well as a fee for the technology infrastructure, the company said in response to a query from Retail TouchPoints.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is not without precedent at Amazon/AWS, which has for years offered technology and infrastructure developed in-house for its own retail operations \u2014 including its Just Walk Out autonomous retail tech, call center solutions, product recommendation tools, and most recently, its Prime fulfillment infrastructure \u2014 as third-party solutions to other retailers.\n\n\u201cAmazon Retail Ad Service helps retailers enhance their shopping experience with highly relevant advertising that guides customers through the shopping journey, helping their shoppers with product discovery and making informed purchase decisions,\u201d said Paula Despins, VP of Ads Measurement at Amazon in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed this to be a win for retailers, advertisers and shoppers, and we look forward to seeing how it improves outcomes, drives sales and enhances the shopping experience.\u201d\n\nAmazon Aims to Expand Advertising Opportunities for Retailers, Brands\n\nThe ads will incorporate product availability and price, in addition to contextual information such as shopper search query, category or product being viewed to ensure customers see ads for desired and available products. Retailers will determine the ad creative formats they want to offer, where ads appear across their apps and websites, and how many ads are shown. They\u2019ll also be able to determine what customers see after clicking on an ad, such as directing traffic to the product page, providing a \u2018quick view\u2019 of the product or enabling the customer to add the product directly to their cart.\n\n\u201cThis innovative solution and proven technology allow us to deliver more relevant and personalized ads to our shoppers, enhancing their experience while driving stronger engagement and conversions,\u201d said Neil Folgate, SVP of Global Marketing at iHerb in a statement. \u201cWith over 1,200 shared brands already active on Amazon Ads, this creates a frictionless opportunity for advertisers to connect with iHerb\u2019s highly motivated audience and drive measurable results.\u201d\n\nParticipating retailers also can choose to make their advertising offerings available via the Amazon Ads console and APIs, thereby giving Amazon advertisers the chance to discover additional opportunities to scale their reach. Advertisers already using Amazon Ads will see available retailers in their Amazon Ads console or API integrations. They can then create and manage their campaigns for each retailer, as well as access reporting, through their existing Amazon Ads workflows.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s Retail Ad Service has the potential to be transformative for advertisers,\u201d said Drew Habeck, SVP of Media at digital media solution Flywheel in a statement. \u201cThis streamlined approach allows us to efficiently manage our advertising efforts across multiple retailers, maximizing our reach. Tapping into Amazon\u2019s expertise in delivering relevant, contextual advertising at all points of the consumer path to purchase is invaluable.\u201d\n\nAmazon Retail Ad Service operates on dedicated systems with stringent access controls to ensure that retailer information is separated from Amazon Ads and other Amazon businesses. Ad measurement takes place within AWS Clean Rooms to enable privacy-safe collaboration and the generation of aggregated, anonymized reports for both the retailer and its advertisers.\n\nTo learn more about retail media, check out our full guide here.",

She is testing out different times to leave the office to see the most time-efficient way to get home.\n\n\"I've been finding it (backed up), honestly, almost the entire drive, but really on the 99, on the freeway, and then through the (Seattle) tunnel,\" Craig explained. \"It's been really backed up.\"\n\nThe Seattle Department of Transportation is monitoring traffic volumes at key intersections in South Lake Union, including those along Mercer Street. Their data shows traffic on Monday sat around 64,710 cars, which is on par with traffic volumes from the same time frame a year earlier. On Tuesday, there was an increase in traffic with nearly 68,000 vehicles, though SDOT claims that fluctuation is nothing out of the ordinary, especially after the holidays.\n\nWhile commuters are going bananas over what's expected to be their new normal, others are enjoying the benefits of the extra foot traffic in South Lake Union, from food trucks and restaurants seeing long lunch lines to employees who appreciate getting to collaborate with coworkers in person more often.\n\nThe popular banana stand at the Amazon Spheres is known for offering free bananas to employees and the public. The woman working there Wednesday told KOMO News she\u2019s lost count of how many she\u2019s given, but said it's a significant boost from typical numbers.\n\nALSO SEE |\n\nA King County Metro spokesperson said it's too soon to know the impact on ridership since Amazon workers returned to the office and that the agency's review is expected to take weeks or months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited that riders will be taking Metro more frequently,\u201d a King County Metro spokesperson wrote to KOMO News. \u201cRoutes serving South Lake Union already have capacity to meet increased ridership in the immediate future, so Metro did not add any additional service hours in anticipation of Amazon\u2019s return to the office.\u201d\n\nIn response to this story, Amazon provided information on commuter benefits provided by the company to give employees flexibility for their commute. Though they vary by location, they include paid public transportation, free commuter shuttles, \"flexible commuter subsidy funds per month for parking, rideshare, carpool, and bike-related costs, and onsite bike cages and shower facilities for employees who bike to work.\"\n\nIn some markets, there are new rideshare options and incentives, as well as commuter and transit connector shuttles, along with expanded parking options, biking facilities, and new bike lease partners.\n\nAmazon also provided information about partnering with local governments for traffic management.\n\n\"Traffic is managed by local municipalities. Most Amazon owned and managed garages have staff to direct vehicles that are entering and exiting our parking facilities.\n\n\"In the Puget Sound area, we\u2019ve worked to support local and state investments in local traffic and transit infrastructure. Many of our offices in the area, and all of our Offices in Bellevue, are within a reasonable walking distance of public transit stations. Our real estate and commute team has increased services and routes on our shuttles in Bellevue and Seattle.\n\n\"For example, in Bellevue that means our offices are within a reasonable walking distance of the Bellevue Transit Center and Sound Transit's Downtown Bellevue light rail station.\n\n\"In the Puget Sound area, as with all of our offices, we look forward to continuing to partner with local and state policymakers on other solutions.\n\n\"Amazon has supported a variety of state and local ballot measures that have expanded access to transit, invested in transportation infrastructure, and preserved crucial funding, including contributed significant funds to support the operation of BellHop, a free electric shuttle service. Bellhop was the first free, all-electric shuttle service in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\"We\u2019re excited by the innovation, collaboration and connection that we've seen already with our teams working in person together. With most employees working from the office each day, teams across the company are focused on ensuring the transition is as smooth as possible as we continue to deliver for customers.\"\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "In 2024, China-based sellers increased their market share to more than 50% on Amazon.\n\nAmerican sellers have dropped below 50% nearly two years ago. However, Chinese sellers have grown above 50% only recently, as there is a small percentage of sellers in other countries. Based on Marketplace Pulse research, Chinese sellers now represent more than 50% of the top sellers on Amazon.com, with U.S. sellers representing roughly 45% and the rest in the U.K., Canada, or other countries. China\u2019s share of all active sellers is even higher. (Some international sellers incorporate in the U.S., so American sellers\u2019 actual share is lower than 45%)\n\nAmazon acknowledged the Chinese seller market share on its marketplace for the first time in the annual Form 10-K filing with the SEC in February 2024, calling it \u201csignificant.\u201d However, it was significant years before Amazon called it out \u2014 their share has steadily increased for nearly a decade on Amazon.com in the U.S. and its other worldwide marketplaces.\n\nIn November 2024, Amazon introduced Amazon Haul, a new section on Amazon to buy directly from sellers in China. It is a small experiment; still, in December, Amazon heavily discounted it by subsidizing the discount (offering as much as 60% off everything). According to Marketplace Pulse data, 100% of Amazon Haul sellers are based in China, just like Temu, which Haul attempts to copy.\n\nThere is no \u201cMade in America\u201d section on Amazon, but Amazon rushed to get Amazon Haul out, an emoji-filled \u201cMade in China\u201d section. Of course, most of everything on Amazon is \u201cMade in China,\u201d even when sold by U.S. sellers. Yet, \u201cMade in China\u201d and \u201cSold by China\u201d are starting to diverge as Chinese sellers shift their manufacturing to other countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs. According to the annual reshoring index from Kearney, China accounts for less than half of the U.S.\u2019s low-cost imports from Asia. China has been losing its share of imports while Chinese sellers on Amazon have been gaining.\n\nThat\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in sales on Amazon globally by third-party sellers in China (given that sales by all third-party sellers on Amazon exceeded $500 billion in 2024). Amazon called that \u201csignificant\u201d because it exposed the company to regulatory and tariff risks. It makes the same fee irrespective of where the seller is based, but nurturing sellers in China promises getting closer to the source at a significant expense of sellers, jobs, taxes, safety, quality, counterfeit, and many other issues in the U.S. Issues beyond Amazon \u2014 Walmart is at 30% Chinese sellers, up from 20% ago \u2014 as it executes in a market with little protectionism.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCustomers can now add new Hyundai Motor Co. vehicles to their shopping carts on Amazon Autos, marking the first time that an automaker has sold cars through the e-commerce giant Amazon, the automaker announced Jan. 7\n\nhas sold cars through the e-commerce giant The newly launched Amazon Autos retail platform allows car shoppers to browse, order and finance any new Hyundai vehicle through participating dealers in 54 U.S. markets, with additional locations planned for later this year. These markets account for 71% of Hyundai\u2019s U.S. sales volumes.\n\n\u201cIt represents the future of automotive retail and our commitment to redefining how cars are marketed and purchased,\u201d Hyundai Motor Co. President and CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz said in the release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHyundai\u2019s plan to sell vehicles on Amazon was first announced in November 2023 and customers could browse for new Hyundai vehicles on Amazon Autos as of Dec. 10. For its U.S. dealers, the official launch of the retail partnership is an opportunity to reach more customers via Amazon.\n\nHyundai is kicking off its partnership with Amazon Autos with a nationwide marketing campaign highlighting the convenience of online car shopping. Additional dealer participation and functionalities will continue to roll out throughout the year, including new financing and lease options.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration allows customers to conveniently discover, learn about, and purchase their preferred Hyundai model from their local dealer through one of the world\u2019s most trusted shopping experiences,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said in the release.\n\nThrough Amazon Autos, customers can search for available Hyundai vehicles by model, trim, color, features and other criteria. They can also arrange financing, sign paperwork electronically and complete the purchase in just a few clicks.\n\nOnce payment arrangements are finalized, buyers select a date and time to pick up their new Hyundai vehicle at a local dealer. Shoppers can also read reviews of dealers before deciding on a pickup location.\n\nAmazon Autos offers no-haggle, transparent pricing set by the Hyundai dealers, eliminating the need for price negotiation. The advertised prices are what buyers pay at check-out with the exception of taxes and fees. The site will also help shoppers find any savings or rebates.\n\nThe platform also offers trade-in options online, where trade-in values are provided by an independent third-party, which can be applied toward the purchase. Customers complete the process when dropping off their trade-in to get their new vehicle.\n\nSince customers pick up their new vehicle from a local Hyundai dealer, there are no violations of franchise laws that prohibit direct-to-consumer sales in some states. These restrictions have limited Tesla\u2019s ability to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in Michigan, Connecticut, South Carolina and other states. Tesla is also restricted from selling directly to customers in Texas, where the company is headquartered.",

You can import the supported architectures into Amazon Bedrock, allowing you to access them on demand through the Amazon Bedrock fully managed invoke model API.\n\nSolution overview\n\nAt the time of writing, Amazon Bedrock supports importing custom models from the following architectures:\n\nMistral\n\nFlan\n\nMeta Llama 2 and Llama 3\n\nFor this post, we use a Hugging Face Flan-T5 Base model.\n\nIn the following sections, I walk you through the steps to train a model in SageMaker JumpStart and import it into Amazon Bedrock. Then you can interact with your custom model through the Amazon Bedrock playgrounds.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, verify that you have an AWS account with Amazon SageMaker Studio and Amazon Bedrock access.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have an instance of SageMaker Studio, see Launch Amazon SageMaker Studio for instructions to create one.\n\nTrain a model in SageMaker JumpStart\n\nComplete the following steps to train a Flan model in SageMaker JumpStart:\n\nOpen the AWS Management Console and go to SageMaker Studio.\n\nIn SageMaker Studio, choose JumpStart in the navigation pane.\n\nWith SageMaker JumpStart, machine learning (ML) practitioners can choose from a broad selection of publicly available FMs using pre-built machine learning solutions that can be deployed in a few clicks.\n\nSearch for and choose the Hugging Face Flan-T5 Base\n\nOn the model details page, you can review a short description of the model, how to deploy it, how to fine-tune it, and what format your training data needs to be in to customize the model.\n\nChoose Train to begin fine-tuning the model on your training data.\n\nCreate the training job using the default settings. The defaults populate the training job with recommended settings.\n\nThe example in this post uses a prepopulated example dataset. When using your own data, enter its location in the Data section, making sure it meets the format requirements.\n\nConfigure the security settings such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, virtual private cloud (VPC), and encryption. Note the value for Output artifact location (S3 URI) to use later. Submit the job to start training.\n\nYou can monitor your job by selecting Training on the Jobs dropdown menu. When the training job status shows as Completed, the job has finished. With default settings, training takes about 10 minutes.\n\nImport the model into Amazon Bedrock\n\nAfter the model has completed training, you can import it into Amazon Bedrock. Complete the following steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Imported models under Foundation models in the navigation pane. Choose Import model.\n\nFor Model name, enter a recognizable name for your model. Under Model import settings, select Amazon SageMaker model and select the radio button next to your model.\n\nUnder Service access, select Create and use a new service role and enter a name for the role. Choose Import model.\n\nThe model import will complete in about 15 minutes.\n\nUnder Playgrounds in the navigation pane, choose Text. Choose Select model.\n\nFor Category, choose Imported models. For Model, choose flan-t5-fine-tuned. For Throughput, choose On-demand. Choose Apply.\n\nYou can now interact with your custom model. In the following screenshot, we use our example custom model to summarize a description about Amazon Bedrock.\n\nClean up\n\nComplete the following steps to clean up your resources:\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to continue using SageMaker, delete your SageMaker domain. If you no longer want to maintain your model artifacts, delete the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where your model artifacts are stored. To delete your imported model from Amazon Bedrock, on the Imported models page on the Amazon Bedrock console, select your model, and then choose the options menu (three dots) and select Delete.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored how the Custom Model Import feature in Amazon Bedrock enables you to use your own custom trained or fine-tuned models for on-demand, cost-efficient inference. By integrating SageMaker model training capabilities with the fully managed, scalable infrastructure of Amazon Bedrock, you now have a seamless way to deploy your specialized models and make them accessible through a simple API.\n\nWhether you prefer the user-friendly SageMaker Studio console or the flexibility of SageMaker notebooks, you can train and import your models into Amazon Bedrock. This allows you to focus on developing innovative applications and solutions, without the burden of managing complex ML infrastructure.\n\nAs the capabilities of large language models continue to evolve, the ability to integrate custom models into your applications becomes increasingly valuable. With the Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import feature, you can now unlock the full potential of your specialized models and deliver tailored experiences to your customers, all while benefiting from the scalability and cost-efficiency of a fully managed service.\n\nTo dive deeper into fine-tuning on SageMaker, see Instruction fine-tuning for FLAN T5 XL with Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart.

Photo by Jos\u00e9 Luis Osorio / CIFOR-ICRAF- Banco Mundial\n\nRestoration has become a cornerstone of global environmental policies, addressing the accelerating environmental degradation, severe biodiversity loss, and the climate crisis. Initiatives such as Initiative 20\u00d720 and the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration align with Target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF), which aims to restore at least 30% of degraded terrestrial, inland water, marine, and coastal ecosystems by 2030. This ambition seeks to enhance biodiversity, sustain local economies and boost resilience against a changing climate.\n\nThe Initiative 20\u00d720, for instance, seeks to restore 50 million hectares in Latin America by 2030, supporting the Decade on Restoration\u2019s goals and promoting a regenerative bioeconomy for inclusive development. At the recent COP16 on Biodiversity in Cali, Colombia, various countries showcased progress by presenting their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) and national targets. However, regarding Target 2, only five Amazon basin countries\u2014Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Suriname, and Bolivia\u2014 have outlined national targets tied to KM-GBF\u2019s restoration goals.\n\nWhile commitments are evolving, pressures on the Amazon region remain relentless. Deforestation, fires, and unprecedented droughts are exacerbating crises for ecosystems, biodiversity, and local populations. At COP16, many practitioners highlighted that achieving KM-GBF goals largely depends on countries\u2019 ability to implement practical actions supported by rigorous and, effective monitoring systems. Given the shared challenges and opportunities in the Amazon, regional cooperation is crucial for establishing alliances and building the capacities necessary for effective restoration.\n\nMoving from pledges to tangible action is no simple task. Ambitious commitments are key, yet their implementation often encounters structural barriers such as weak governance, inadequate stakeholder cooperation, insufficient monitoring systems to track progress, and a lack of context-appropriate financing for sustained action on the ground.\n\nIn Latin America, governmental and corporate restoration declarations are promising but frequently fail to yield tangible, lasting results. This disparity between rhetoric and reality underscores the need to rethink restoration strategies. Achieving quantitative targets requires genuine community engagement, strengthened governance among diverse actors, and adequate technical and financial support.\n\nBeyond hectares pledged\n\nEffective restoration of biodiversity, ecosystems, and local communities necessitates a \u201cwhole-of-government, whole-of-society\u201d approach. This approach ensures inclusive implementation by recognising the contributions of all stakeholders and rights holders. Addressing governance challenges and enhancing coordination across sectors is essential. Coherent policies and robust collaborative actions can create innovative pathways to achieving national, regional, and global restoration goals.\n\nDuring a session facilitated by the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) at COP16, stakeholders stressed the need for a \u201cmulti-actor working group on restoration.\u201d Such a platform would foster cross-sector collaboration and actors, provide knowledge-sharing opportunities and enable more coherent, integrated restoration planning. Read also Five key takeaways from UNCBD COP16 in Cali, Colombia\n\nRestoration efforts involve more than tree planting or vegetation cover recovery. Inclusive governance and cultural practices are critical to addressing ecosystems\u2019 and communities\u2019 needs effectively. Indigenous Peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 active participation, combining traditional and scientific knowledge, enhances restoration processes. Practices such as using indicator plants for environmental monitoring and selecting locally adapted species are crucial for sustainable, culturally sensitive restoration. Ancestral wisdom in ecological management enables communities to act as guardians of their territories, promoting continuous ecosystem preservation. Ensuring land and resource rights for these communities is essentials for fostering interest-aligned, lasting restoration.\n\n\u201cHow many medicinal plants used by Indigenous Peoples have we lost and can no longer find? How many plants we rely on for food are now gone?\u201d\n\nSin\u00e9ia do Vale, a Wapichana leader from the Amazon, highlighted during the session \u201cToward 2030: National Strategies and NBSAP Implementation.\u201d at COP16, \u201cHow many medicinal plants used by Indigenous Peoples have we lost and can no longer find? How many plants we rely on for food are now gone? We have a direct connection with all this biodiversity, tracking it with cultural calendars. In recent years, climate change\u2019s extreme heat has severely affected plants and animals.\u201d\n\nSin\u00e9ia, an environmental coordinator for the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR) and Latin America and the Caribbean co-chair of the International Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC), underscored Indigenous Peoples\u2019 autonomous strategies blending ancestral and non-Indigenous science. These approaches significantly contributed to Brazil\u2019s National Adaptation Plan.\n\nEconomic viability is another critical challenge for restoration initiatives. Promoting a bioeconomy\u2014developing seed networks, nurseries, and restoration services in collaboration with communities\u2014emerges as a promising path. However, this model requires robust financial backing, impact investments, and regulatory frameworks that incentivise regenerative practices. Public policies that render bioeconomy initiatives attractive and accessible are fundamental for providing sustainable alternatives to resource exploitation.\n\nTarget 2 of the KM-GBF for ecosystem restoration intersects with other goals, including sustainable native species use (Target 5), invasive species control (Target 6), climate impact reduction (Target 8), and sustainable agricultural and forestry practices (Target 10). It also connects to Target 22, which focuses on gender equality and the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Thus, Target 22 reinforces the necessity of participatory governance and diverse actor engagement in decision-making.\n\nRestoring ecosystems transcends environmental matter; it is a social and economic obligation. To implement the KM-GBF, Initiative 20\u00d720 and the Bonn Challenge effectively, countries must strengthen national and subnational policies, foster inclusive coordination among sectors and stakeholders, and build technical and financial mobilization capacities. Engaging and substantially supporting local populations, alongside advancing research and innovation, will accelerate action and secure a resilient future for the Amazonian ecosystems and all who depend on them.\n\nFor more information on this topic, contact:\n\nRoc\u00edo Vasquez at r.vasquez@cifor-icraf.org\n\nHenrique Marques at h.marques@cifor-icraf.org\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This analysis reflects the authors\u2019 views and not those of CIFOR-ICRAF.\n\nRoc\u00edo Vasquez is a research associate in evidence-based governance and engagement at CIFOR-ICRAF Peru.

This collaboration allows customers to conveniently discover, learn about, and purchase their preferred Hyundai model from their local dealer through one of the world's most trusted shopping experiences. It represents the future of automotive retail and our commitment to redefining how cars are marketed and purchased.\"\n\nNational Marketing Campaign\n\nTo support the launch, Hyundai is announcing an extensive marketing campaign that includes integrated partnerships, TV and digital video advertising, social extensions and more. All-new ads highlighting the joy and simplicity of \"Add to Cart\" begin airing across television, social and digital channels today.\n\nThe ad, set in an Amazon fulfillment center, showcases iconic toys and merchandise typically ordered from Amazon, culminating in the reveal of the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe from an Amazon shipping box. The creative then fades into showing how seamless it is to add the Santa Fe to an Amazon Cart on your phone via Amazon Autos.\n\nThe content will air nationally, including during upcoming professional football and basketball games, and on Amazon Prime Video properties. Beyond video, Hyundai is diversifying the channel mix to demonstrate the ease of purchase on Amazon through out-of-home (OOH), audio, website content, paid search and media partnership integrations.\n\nFurthermore, Hyundai is also spotlighting key consumer benefits such as ease and convenience in a mini-campaign series titled \"In the Time it Takes\", which will run on digital and social channels beginning in mid-January through March. The creative highlights various scenarios in life that should be simple but take longer than expected (i.e. finding the remote or teaching your parent the newest slang term) and then shows how purchasing a Hyundai vehicle on Amazon Autos is even easier than these tasks and could have been completed in this time.\n\nThe integrated program was developed in collaboration with Hyundai's creative agency of record, INNOCEAN USA, while its media agency, Canvas, coordinated the media buys.\n\nAmazon Autos Vehicle Purchase Experience\n\nThe following Amazon Autos information is from About Amazon.\n\nWith Amazon Autos, customers have a simple, end-to-end online experience to purchase their next Hyundai vehicle, allowing them to:\n\nBrowse and search for available vehicles at their local dealer by make, model, trim, color, and features\n\nGet an instant valuation and trade-in their existing vehicle toward the price of the new car\n\nSelect their preferred car\n\nSecure financing or pay in full\n\nComplete the checkout process online with their chosen payment option\n\nSchedule a pick-up time at the dealership\n\nAll of this is done within the convenient Amazon experience that customers know and trust, providing a streamlined and transparent car buying process from search to purchase.\n\nConvenient, streamlined experience\n\nWith Amazon Autos, customers can search available vehicles from local participating dealers by model, trim, color, features and more\u2014all in one place.

            "content": "This post was co-written with Ben Doughton, Head of Product Operations \u2013 LCH, Iulia Midus, Site Reliability Engineer \u2013 LCH, and Maurizio Morabito, Software and AI specialist \u2013 LCH (part of London Stock Exchange Group, LSEG).\n\nIn the financial industry, quick and reliable access to information is essential, but searching for data or facing unclear communication can slow things down. An AI-powered assistant can change that. By instantly providing answers and helping to navigate complex systems, such assistants can make sure that key information is always within reach, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of miscommunication. Amazon Q Business is a generative AI-powered assistant that can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in your enterprise systems. Amazon Q Business enables employees to become more creative, data-driven, efficient, organized, and productive.\n\nIn this blog post, we explore a client services agent assistant application developed by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) using Amazon Q Business. We will discuss how Amazon Q Business saved time in generating answers, including summarizing documents, retrieving answers to complex Member enquiries, and combining information from different data sources (while providing in-text citations to the data sources used for each answer).\n\nThe challenge\n\nThe London Clearing House (LCH) Group of companies includes leading multi-asset class clearing houses and are part of the Markets division of LSEG PLC (LSEG Markets). LCH provides proven risk management capabilities across a range of asset classes, including over-the-counter (OTC) and listed interest rates, fixed income, foreign exchange (FX), credit default swap (CDS), equities, and commodities.\n\nAs the LCH business continues to grow, the LCH team has been continuously exploring ways to improve their support to customers (members) and to increase LSEG\u2019s impact on customer success. As part of LSEG\u2019s multi-stage AI strategy, LCH has been exploring the role that generative AI services can have in this space. One of the key capabilities that LCH is interested in is a managed conversational assistant that requires minimal technical knowledge to build and maintain. In addition, LCH has been looking for a solution that is focused on its knowledge base and that can be quickly kept up to date. For this reason, LCH was keen to explore techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Following a review of available solutions, the LCH team decided to build a proof-of-concept around Amazon Q Business.\n\nBusiness use case\n\nRealizing value from generative AI relies on a solid business use case. LCH has a broad base of customers raising queries to their client services (CS) team across a diverse and complex range of asset classes and products. Example queries include: \u201cWhat is the eligible collateral at LCH?\u201d and \u201cCan members clear NIBOR IRS at LCH?\u201d This requires CS team members to refer to detailed service and policy documentation sources to provide accurate advice to their members.\n\nHistorically, the CS team has relied on producing product FAQs for LCH members to refer to and, where required, an in-house knowledge center for CS team members to refer to when answering complex customer queries. To improve the customer experience and boost employee productivity, the CS team set out to investigate whether generative AI could help answer questions from individual members, thus reducing the number of customer queries. The goal was to increase the speed and accuracy of information retrieval within the CS workflows when responding to the queries that inevitably come through from customers.\n\nProject workflow\n\nThe CS use case was developed through close collaboration between LCH and Amazon Web Service (AWS) and involved the following steps:\n\nIdeation: The LCH team carried out a series of cross-functional workshops to examine different large language model (LLM) approaches including prompt engineering, RAG, and custom model fine tuning and pre-training. They considered different technologies such as Amazon SageMaker and Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and evaluated trade-offs between development effort and model customization. Amazon Q Business was selected because of its built-in enterprise search web crawler capability and ease of deployment without the need for LLM deployment. Another attractive feature was the ability to clearly provide source attribution and citations. This enhanced the reliability of the responses, allowing users to verify facts and explore topics in greater depth (important aspects to increase their overall trust in the responses received). Knowledge base creation: The CS team built data sources connectors for the LCH website, FAQs, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and internal knowledge repositories and included the Amazon Q Business built-in index and retriever in the build. Integration and testing: The application was secured using a third-party identity provider (IdP) as the IdP for identity and access management to manage users with their enterprise IdP and used AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate users when they signed in to Amazon Q Business. Testing was carried out to verify factual accuracy of responses, evaluating the performance and quality of the AI-generated answers, which demonstrated that the system had achieved a high level of factual accuracy. Wider improvements in business performance were demonstrated including enhancements in response time, where responses were delivered within a few seconds. Tests were undertaken with both unstructured and structured data within the documents. Phased rollout: The CS AI assistant was rolled out in a phased approach to provide thorough, high-quality answers. In the future, there are plans to integrate their Amazon Q Business application with existing email and CRM interfaces, and to expand its use to additional use cases and functions within LSEG.\n\nSolution overview\n\nIn this solution overview, we\u2019ll explore the LCH-built Amazon Q Business application.\n\nThe LCH admin team developed a web-based interface that serves as a gateway for their internal client services team to interact with the Amazon Q Business API and other AWS services (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon ECS), Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Bedrock) and secured it using SAML 2.0 IAM federation\u2014maintaining secure access to the chat interface\u2014to retrieve answers from a pre-indexed knowledge base and to validate the responses using Anthropic\u2019s Claude v2 LLM.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the architecture for the LCH client services application.\n\nThe workflow consists of the following steps:\n\nThe LCH team set up the Amazon Q Business application using a SAML 2.0 IAM IdP. (The example in the blog post shows connecting with Okta as the IdP for Amazon Q Business. However, the LCH team built the application using a third-party solution as the IdP instead of Okta). This architecture allows LCH users to sign in using their existing identity credentials from their enterprise IdP, while they maintain control over which users have access to their Amazon Q Business application. The application had two data sources as part of the configuration for their Amazon Q Business application: An S3 bucket to store and index their internal LCH documents. This allows the Amazon Q Business application to access and search through their internal product FAQ PDF documents as part of providing responses to user queries. Indexing the documents in Amazon S3 makes them readily available for the application to retrieve relevant information. In addition to internal documents, the team has also set up their public-facing LCH website as a data source using a web crawler that can index and extract information from their rulebooks. The LCH team opted for a custom user interface (UI) instead of the built-in web experience provided by Amazon Q Business to have more control over the frontend by directly accessing the Amazon Q Business API. The application\u2019s frontend was developed using the open source application framework and hosted on Amazon ECS. The frontend application accesses an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint to interact with the business logic written in AWS Lambda The architecture consists of two Lambda functions: An authorizer Lambda function is responsible for authorizing the frontend application to access the Amazon Q business API by generating temporary AWS credentials. A ChatSync Lambda function is responsible for accessing the Amazon Q Business ChatSync API to start an Amazon Q Business conversation. The architecture includes a Validator Lambda function, which is used by the admin to validate the accuracy of the responses generated by the Amazon Q Business application. The LCH team has stored a golden answer knowledge base in an S3 bucket, consisting of approximately 100 questions and answers about their product FAQs and rulebooks collected from their live agents. This knowledge base serves as a benchmark for the accuracy and reliability of the AI-generated responses. By comparing the Amazon Q Business chat responses against their golden answers, LCH can verify that the AI-powered assistant is providing accurate and consistent information to their customers. The Validator Lambda function retrieves data from a DynamoDB table and sends it to Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) that can be used to quickly experiment with and evaluate top FMs for a given use case, privately customize the FMs with existing data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using enterprise systems and data sources. The Amazon Bedrock service uses Anthropic\u2019s Claude v2 model to validate the Amazon Q Business application queries and responses against the golden answers stored in the S3 bucket. Anthropic\u2019s Claude v2 model returns a score for each question and answer, in addition to a total score, which is then provided to the application admin for review. The Amazon Q Business application returned answers within a few seconds for each question. The overall expectation is that Amazon Q Business saves time for each live agent on each question by providing quick and correct responses.\n\nThis validation process helped LCH to build trust and confidence in the capabilities of Amazon Q Business, enhancing the overall customer experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis post provides an overview of LSEG\u2019s experience in adopting Amazon Q Business to support LCH client services agents for B2B query handling. This specific use case was built by working backward from a business goal to improve customer experience and staff productivity in a complex, highly technical area of the trading life cycle (post-trade). The variety and large size of enterprise data sources and the regulated environment that LSEG operates in makes this post particularly relevant to customer service operations dealing with complex query handling. Managed, straightforward-to-use RAG is a key capability within a wider vision of providing technical and business users with an environment, tools, and services to use generative AI across providers and LLMs. You can get started with this tool by creating a sample Amazon Q Business application.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nBen Doughton is a Senior Product Manager at LSEG with over 20 years of experience in Financial Services.

            "content": "Omnicom continued to focus on advances and changes in search during CES this week, announcing a partnership with Amazon Ads and Omnicom\u2019s Flywheel unit that enables access to five years of purchase data \u2014 a move Amazon is announcing today for its Amazon Marketing Cloud clean-room solution, and an expansion from the current 13 months of data.\n\nThe deal gives Omnicom Media Group and Flywheel first-to-market access in the U.S. to the expanded data, with the goal to extend it globally. Again, much of the flow of information will also run through Omnicom\u2019s operating platform Omni, as it did with Omnicom\u2019s announced search deal with Google yesterday.\n\nVia a beta test, Flywheel customers are able to access five years of purchase history to see how consumers\u2019 purchase habits and conversions have evolved or changed in that time, which allows brands to adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis capability, which [Flywheel] has really led the development of [for OMG], is both going to empower our ability within Amazon\u2019s sponsored ads, so essentially Amazon search capability, but also more broadly,\u201d said Megan Pagliuca, Omnicom Media Group\u2019s chief product officer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chatter in the market that scale doesn\u2019t bring an advantage in a biddable world. Yes, it does, and this is another example of that.\u201d\n\nPatrick Miller, co-founder of Flywheel, explained that since Covid first affected consumer habits by profoundly increasing their use of e-commerce, Amazon\u2019s become more and more important to brands, including CPG and others not considered endemic to the e-commece giant.\n\n\u201cWithin the CPG category, over a four year window we saw 70% of customers bought from one CPG [on Amazon],\u201d said Miller. \u201cBut that\u2019s also true in other categories as well \u2014 within apparel, 52% of customers purchased multiple times over four years. \u2026 And so for brands, it allows them to look over a longer period of time and see those insights to then say, \u2018Hey, this is worth it in that investment within search or display.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe launch of this optimized capability adds to our suite of full-funnel AMC advertising solutions that enable our customers to execute media plans with deeper insights and accurate measurement,\u201d said Paula Despins, vp of measurement, analytics and data science at Amazon Ads. \u201cExtending a brand\u2019s available lookback window from 13 months of their Amazon purchase signals to five years enables advertisers to more deeply understand key customer journey metrics \u2026 by analyzing a broader timeframe based on a product\u2019s lifecycle or their customers\u2019 engagement with their brand portfolio over time.\u201d\n\nOne Flywheel client, Haleon, which owns medicine-cabinet brands such as Advil and Flonase, sees this as a \u201chuge unlock,\u201d said Kelly Kavanagh, its senior director of integrated marketing and media. \u201cOur consumers\u2019 long-term value is notoriously hard to quantify,\u201d Kavanagh said. The five-year lookback of AMC data will allow us to measure how consumers interact and mature with Haleon. It allows us to make smarter decisions about where and how we invest today to maximize value for Haleon\u2019s long term strategic growth ambitions.\u201d\n\nOmni once again serves as the conduit for the data flow in the deal with Amazon Ads. \u201cThe idea is to integrate [the information] into the full workflow, so not just when we\u2019re looking to purchase commerce-related media, but also to take these insights and to bring them up to the planning process,\u201d said Clarissa Season, chief experience officer at OMG\u2019s Annalect, which essentially runs the Omni platform. \u201cWe have this rich set of insights, and we integrate it into the workflow \u2014 from what we know about consumers to how we think about activating those consumers. And then we want to measure the impact at the end and then optimize it and make it better for next time around.\u201d",

Amazon announced in October that it plans to build nuclear reactors in southeast Washington that would power its data centers in Umatilla and Morrow counties, but many tribes and environmentalists are against it. Courtesy Annie Warren/NWPB\n\nChuck Johnson was 25 years old when he helped bring Oregon\u2019s nuclear energy industry to a sudden halt.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nFresh out of college, Johnson helped lead signature gathering and field organizing to pass Ballot Measure 7, which banned all new nuclear power plants in the state until the U.S. had a federally licensed permanent disposal facility. When Oregon\u2019s only nuclear energy facility was closed in 1992, the measure effectively ensured that nothing would take its place unless major changes happened.\n\nFor decades those changes seemed unlikely, but a new push by the power-hungry tech industry has reignited interest in nuclear energy in the region.\n\nAmazon announced in October that it is partnering with Energy Northwest to develop and build nuclear reactors in southeast Washington that would power its data centers in Umatilla and Morrow counties. Amazon would work with its partners to develop and roll out a novel technology \u2013 small modular nuclear reactors \u2013 without brushing up against the limits of Measure 7 because the reactors would be north of the Columbia River.\n\nFor Amazon, SMRs would allow the tech and e-commerce giant to harness the immense, low-carbon power potential of nuclear energy while staying true to its climate goals, and avoiding the safety and environmental concerns that have plagued traditional reactors. More than 40 years after passing Measure 7, Johnson isn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get rid of the waste produced by these plants, it\u2019s irresponsible for us to \u2013 for the sake of some electricity right now \u2013 leave this legacy to future generations,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is a part of a group of environmentalists, academics and American Indian tribes who are gathering force against a nuclear energy revival in the Northwest.\n\nNuclear energy opponents argue that SMRs are simply a new coat of paint on the industry\u2019s old problems. Like traditional reactors, they say that SMRs aren\u2019t economically feasible and risk exposing people to nuclear radiation in a region still recovering from its World War II legacy.\n\nThe X-energy command room in Rockville, Md. Amazon plans to use X-energy's nuclear reactor design to power its Eastern Oregon data centers. Photo courtesy of X-energy / Photo courtesy of X-energy\n\n\u2018It\u2019s for their profit\u2019\n\nM.V. Ramana\u2019s argument against SMRs is economic as much as it is scientific.\n\nA professor in the School of Public Affairs and Global Policy at the University of British Columbia, Ramana said the global share of electricity generated from nuclear reactors has been shrinking for decades, mainly due to the cost of building them.\n\nRamana pointed to the U.S.\u2019s newest nuclear reactor project as an example. A nuclear reactor expansion at Plant Vogtle in Georgia went billions of dollars over budget before its first reactor went online in 2023.\n\nProponents say SMRs could solve the cost problem. At about one-tenth the size of a traditional reactor, SMR parts could be manufactured offsite, a process expected to save considerable money. While SMRs might sacrifice total capacity, their output is anticipated to far exceed other forms of low-carbon energy like solar and wind.\n\nRamana is skeptical of this argument, too. He said traditional reactors rely on an economy of scale: Their large size carries a great expense but it also means more energy to generate and sell. While an SMR might be one-tenth the size of a traditional reactor, Ramana said not all the costs of running and operating it are going to shrink by the same margin. SMR developers have also yet to realize decreased construction costs, Ramana said. He referenced NuScale, a Portland company whose SMR project in Idaho ballooned its cost 75% to $9.3 billion before it was canceled.\n\nAmazon and other tech companies are backing nuclear as they promote technologies reliant on artificial intelligence because the hardware used to compute that data has extensive energy needs. The International Energy Agency projects data center energy consumption to double from 2022 to 2026. But optimistic timelines for the completion of the Amazon SMRs in Washington estimates they wouldn\u2019t be built for at least seven years. Ramana said that\u2019s enough time for the data demand bubble to burst.\n\n\u201cThey need the power right now, because right now is when the market is hot,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no guarantee that in 10 years the market is going to be hot and they will need all this power.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said it won\u2019t abandon its other green energy efforts as it pursues nuclear projects.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest in new sources of solar, wind, and energy storage, alongside nuclear facilities \u2026 Expanding our energy investment strategy to include other forms of carbon-free energy, including nuclear, is the most viable option to bring new sources of carbon-free energy online quickly enough to help bridge this gap,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nIf Amazon and other tech companies were truly interested in protecting the world from climate change, Ramana said, they would take steps to reduce their data businesses rather than growing its energy usage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for their profit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not for the environmental good that they are doing it.\u201d\n\nThe Hanford Site pictured in 2021. Amazon announced in October that it plans to build nuclear reactors in southeast Washington that would power its data centers in Umatilla and Morrow counties, but many tribes and environmentalists are against it. ANNA KING/NW NEWS NETWORK\n\nHanford\u2019s legacy\n\nColumbia Riverkeeper staff attorney Simone Anter describes Hanford Reach as an idyllic spot, the last undammed, free-flowing part of the Columbia River and an important spawning grounds for Chinook salmon.\n\nIt\u2019s also near the most nuclear waste-polluted area in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nDuring World War II and the Cold War, the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington was the top producer of weapons-grade plutonium in the U.S. While Hanford stopped producing plutonium in the 1980s, the site left behind hundreds of billions of gallons of nuclear waste in underground storage tanks that leached into the soil.\n\nAnter said Columbia Riverkeeper was formed when two groups worried about nuclear pollution in the Columbia merged.\n\n\u201cA lot of our work centers around this idea that Hanford is not a nuclear waste dumping ground, it is a place that has a future that people want to use and will use,\u201d she said.\n\nBuilding new nuclear reactors would be a literal barrier to clean-up efforts as new buildings could cover contaminated areas, Anter said. Columbia Riverkeeper is also concerned that SMRs could mean further nuclear pollution in the event of a meltdown.\n\nSMR backers say that the size and technology of these reactors significantly reduces the risk of a meltdown. But even if the reactors avoid meltdowns, Ramana said they would still generate waste that will take hundreds or even thousands of years to decay.\n\nThe Nixyaawii Governance Center in Mission, Ore., on April 30, 2024, located in Umatilla County. Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation has ceded land at Hanford and has opposed SMRs for years. Antonio Sierra / OPB\n\nThe tribes respond\n\nIndigenous tribes often bear the brunt of the nuclear energy industry\u2019s follies.\n\nTribes in the Southwest have long protested uranium mining near their communities , highlighting how radiation exposure has hurt tribal members\u2019 health.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, the Yakama Nation has religious sites at Hanford and is directly involved in clean-up efforts. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation also has ceded land at Hanford and has opposed SMRs for years. They reiterated their opposition in a December statement, writing that they were against any \u201cexpansion of nuclear energy\u201d unless developers sought permission through the CTUIR government.\n\nAmazon has spent several years building a relationship with the CTUIR, including the establishment of an educational lab on the Umatilla Indian Reservation in 2022. But the tribes are concerned about how SMRs would affect water quality, fish and game habitat and plant life, all integral parts of the tribes\u2019 First Foods.\n\nEarly signs also point to nuclear energy becoming a hot topic at the upcoming legislative session in Salem. State Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, has already said she will sponsor a bill that would authorize an SMR pilot program in Umatilla County. A legislative committee also received a presentation on SMRs from nuclear energy officials in December.\n\nIt\u2019s a fight Johnson, who helped curtail the nuclear energy industry by leading the effort to pass Measure 7 in 1980, hasn\u2019t let go.\n\nIn the years that followed the measure\u2019s passage, he worked as a fundraiser for Portland State University and Western Oregon University, but Johnson re-engaged with the nuclear issue following the 2011 nuclear power plant meltdown in Fukushima, Japan.\n\nHe steered his career track back toward nuclear opposition, becoming a program manager for the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, first moving to Boston and then Switzerland to lead the organization\u2019s Geneva office.\n\nJohnson intends to retire later this year and return to Oregon, where he plans to remain active in opposing nuclear energy. He sees the sudden push for SMRs as an act of hubris from the country\u2019s \u201ctech bros,\u201d an unearned confidence that they could unlock the potential of nuclear energy where previous generations have failed. Given the long, uncertain timeline for SMRs, Johnson thinks it\u2019s just a ploy for tech companies to consume however much energy they want, whether it\u2019s low carbon or not.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cynical,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically saying, \u2018We got a promise to be carbon free, and fortunately for us, it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to take a while to do.\u2019\u201d",

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAn estimated 600 Amazon workers went on a short strike or participated in pickets from December 19 to Christmas Eve across eight warehouse locations, from Queens to San Francisco. The coordinated mobilization was an opening salvo to Amazon and a test of capacity for the Teamsters\u2019 growing national network. The union says it represents between 7,000 and 10,000 Amazon workers, either by authorization election or majority demand for recognition: a fulfillment center on Staten Island, an air hub in Southern California, a delivery station warehouse in San Francisco, and a handful of delivery contractors. It had given the company a deadline to begin bargaining with all these workers, though no one expected Amazon to actually fold over the holidays. The Teamsters also recruited stewards, retirees, and rank-and-file United Parcel Service (UPS) workers to picket entrances to dozens of Amazon fulfillment warehouses nationwide. Picket-line extensions generally were handled by local officers and staff, and their effectiveness varied. Amazon employs 740,000 workers across its warehouses and distribution centers, and 390,000 drivers nominally employed by 4,400 contractors, called Delivery Service Partners (DSPs); Amazon retains full control of their operations. The holiday strike was perfectly timed for peak season at Amazon \u2014 but unfortunately also for when reporters go on vacation and newsrooms are on low staffing for the holidays, though the Teamsters succeeded in nabbing positive national headlines. How extensive was the impact on production? In my earlier reporting, I was able to answer the question: some dips in volume, but not enough to exact a cost on Amazon\u2019s promise of timely delivery. These walkouts did reveal new leaders and stiffen the spines of existing ones, though. An equally important metric is strike participation. On Christmas Eve, I could offer only snapshots of what I saw on picket lines I visited, but since then, I\u2019ve pieced together as comprehensive as possible an estimate of the strike numbers, drawing on a network of worker contacts at Amazon who spoke to me on background. Where workers declined to speak for fear of upsetting higher-ups in the Teamsters, I have supplemented my on-the-ground reporting with the picket visits of supporters. Below is a breakdown of worker participation. The Teamsters international didn\u2019t respond to a request for how many workers received strike pay, which is another useful measure of participation.\n\nQueens Drivers Joined A delivery station is a small warehouse, the last stop in Amazon\u2019s logistics chain, where packages are dispatched to the drivers who deliver them. At the DBK4 delivery station in Queens, New York, 200 drivers struck, including 190 who did their full picket-line duty, meaning they walked the picket all five days, and ten who participated only partially, opting to stay home or cross the line. Eight DSPs operate out of the Queens location, with a total workforce of 700 to 800 drivers. At the same location, two dozen warehouse workers joined the strike the morning of December 21, out of 120 or more. Workers there have been leading walkouts over the past three years, but this one had the strongest participation yet and was the first to include drivers. \u201cWe have stronger, more experienced leaders,\u201d said one of the strikers, who has been at Amazon for five years: And the people in the warehouse see it. They\u2019re gonna see us come back to work, and they\u2019re gonna see Amazon\u2019s full of shit and that the union is not this outside group \u2014 it\u2019s these people who went on strike and are now working next to them on the belt.\n\nOn Staten Island, Dues Lies Hurt At the mammoth JFK8 fulfillment center on Staten Island, estimates of strike participation ranged from 150 to 350. Days earlier, Amazon Labor Union\u2013IBT Local 1 (ALU) president Connor Spence had said in a statement that 700 workers had pledged to strike. The facility had expanded its workforce for the holidays from 5,500 to more than 6,000. Nationwide Amazon hired 250,000 seasonal workers. At Local 1\u2019s union hall before midnight on December 20, Vice President Brima Sylla was preparing to lead workers out: \u201cWe\u2019ll be making sure we get most of the workers from all the departments, from inbound to outbound to shipdock.\u201d But once he got inside the facility, Sylla said, managers pulled him into a meeting, delaying the walkout. As I stood outside with a gaggle of reporters and supporters, the cops asked people to leave and began checking Amazon IDs. I hid behind a car as the cops marched the other reporters off the property. Once the coast was clear, I recorded the walkout. Fourteen workers walked out a little before 1 a.m., while a dozen more waited outside cheering. The picket lines swelled to hundreds counting supporters, including many from the Democratic Socialists of America, which rented two buses. Workers per picket shift numbered about thirty to fifty. With freezing sleet falling, Ken Coates said some of his coworkers were too intimidated to take part. He said Amazon had threatened workers that if their unpaid time off (UPT) ran out, they would be terminated. It is illegal for Amazon to fire workers for striking and likely illegal to threaten to do so. The company also spread lies about the union deducting dues even without a contract \u2014 a misrepresentation of the voluntary dues that the union is encouraging. \u201cA lot of our coworkers are still scared,\u201d said Coates. \u201cBut hopefully with this community support, they\u2019ll be encouraged to come together.\u201d Amazon\u2019s insistence on docking workers for UPT when they strike has been a big challenge at warehouses because it effectively reduces the duration of strikes and interferes with workers\u2019 federal right to engage in concerted activity. Workers have filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, but the company keeps violating their rights while stalling in the courts. \u201cWhen we try to explain to people they have these protections, it\u2019s difficult also to reconcile that with the messaging that in another area of the law, Amazon\u2019s obligation to bargain, they\u2019re breaking it,\u201d said Spence. \u201cAnd so then we had to pivot the conversation, helping people understand the laws exist, and they do protect us to a certain degree, but the real protection we have when we engage in these kinds of actions is the power of numbers.\u201d\n\nAround the Country At the Southern California air hub KSBD, one hundred workers struck. The facility employs about one thousand. In the Atlanta area, an estimated thirty drivers struck, at one of the three DSPs that operate out of the DGT8 delivery station. Amazon caps the workforce of each DSP at eighty to 120 drivers. At the San Francisco DCK6 delivery station, twenty out of 160 warehouse workers struck. In Southern California, the Teamsters count the delivery station DAX8 as one of the struck facilities, but these workers had actually been fired in 2023. After workers unionized at the DSP, Battle-Tested Strategies, Amazon canceled its contract, firing all eighty-four drivers; Amazon was the company\u2019s only client, and it hasn\u2019t operated since. (Amazon pulled the same stunt in 2017 when drivers organized at a DSP in Detroit.) Some of the fired workers have since traveled the country spreading picket-line extensions. In the Chicago area, the delivery station DIL7 had eighty drivers on picket duty, including workers whose DSP contract had been canceled last June as well as workers from the other three active DSP contractors. The workers there extended picket lines to four other facilities. I wasn\u2019t able to secure numbers for drivers at another delivery station in Southern California, DFX4. Workers didn\u2019t strike at an air hub in Kentucky, and at locations where the worker committees are only loosely affiliated with the Teamsters, including a fulfillment center in the Hudson Valley of New York and a delivery station in Pontiac, Michigan, where workers previously walked off the job. Meanwhile on December 23, after three years of organizing, the independent union Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment filed for election at a huge fulfillment center in North Carolina.\n\nA Five-Year Program? No doubt the Teamsters have inflated the rhetoric in calling these \u201chistoric\u201d and the \u201clargest\u201d strikes at Amazon. But the strikes weren\u2019t fake or astroturfed, either. Many of the facilities that participated in the strike were part of formerly independent organizing efforts led by rank-and-file workers and salts. Besides the ALU at the JFK8 fulfillment center in New York, all of the following have now joined the Teamsters: Amazonians United NYC at DBK4; Amazonians United ATL at DGT8; the Kentucky air hub KCVG, which had been loosely affiliated with ALU; and the air hub KSBD in California, which until recently was an independent organizing effort by the Inland Empire Amazon Workers United and loosely affiliated with Amazonians United. The Teamsters union has increasingly gotten more serious about taking the fight to Amazon, not just rhetorically but also by investing in the organizing push. One piece of that is using picket-line extensions to get regional councils and locals on board. In a December 23 appearance on the racist nationalist commentator Tucker Carlson\u2019s YouTube show, Teamsters president Sean O\u2019Brien said the fight at Amazon is going to take time. \u201cWe\u2019ve put together a program,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a four- or five-year program. Every single day we are building momentum. We\u2019re building worker power.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s overtures to far-right figures like Carlson who are stoking nativist nationalism present an obstacle to the organizing at Amazon, where black, Latino, and immigrant workers make up a majority of the multiethnic workforce. O\u2019Brien has been cozying up to Donald Trump and appeared last summer at the Republican National Convention where the crowd waved \u201cDeport Them Now\u201d signs.\n\nBuilding a Sand Castle The central challenge at Amazon, for Teamsters and independent unions alike, is how to build a durable organization in a workplace with an annual churn of 150 percent. Organizing there can be like building a sand castle on a beach shore only to watch subsequent waves wash it away. Amazonians United\u2019s core strategy has been to build power through minority actions, what the late historian Mike Davis called \u201cthe ceaseless guerrilla warfare against management\u2019s despotism.\u201d \u201cWe think big but start small, building on wins that grow our confidence in taking greater risks over time,\u201d members of the network wrote in Labor Notes in 2020, after running petition campaigns, marching on the boss, and organizing walkouts in multiple states.",

            "content": "Denver, Colorado \u2013 Colorado-based data center owner and developer Brian Watson and his company, Northstar Commercial Partners, are taking Amazon and its top leadership to federal court (Case No. 1:24-cv-03559) alleging anticompetitive conduct in an effort to restrain trade and monopolize the market using a variety of tactics including witness tampering, bribery, and racketeering. The complaint alleges Amazon wielded its extensive influence to unfairly direct the Department of Justice, using false claims, to investigate Watson and Northstar, in a four and a half year-long probe that yielded no charges.\n\nThe suit is seeking over $8 billion in damages, naming Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon Data Services, Inc., Amazon Web Services, Inc., and several top executives personally, including Amazon\u2019s Founder and Chairman Jeffrey Bezos, Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Dennis Wallace, General Counsel, Keith Klein, AWS Real Estate Transaction Manager, Yousri Omar, Director and Associate General Counsel at Amazon, Matthew Doden, Senior Corporate Counsel on Amazon\u2019s Business Conduct and Ethics Team, and former Vice President of AWS Data Center Community at Amazon Web Services, Chris Vonderhaar.\n\nThe detailed 70-page complaint describes a Colorado business Watson founded and built from the ground up for nearly 20 years by the time he and Northstar Commercial Partners properly bid to build and own data centers for Amazon in Northern Virginia. In 2017 Northstar was a billion-dollar company, with real estate assets located in 17 states, 40 employees, and sought-after professional know-how.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Northstar was among several developers to go through the highly competitive and rigorous bidding process to develop and own data centers for Amazon, which are large buildings that store computing machines and related hardware for data services used by companies and governments. The suit states Amazon\u2019s Web Services branch (AWS) runs approximately 299 data centers in 20 countries.\n\nCourt records say Northstar entered the data center business in 2018, successfully completing its first two data centers for Amazon by 2019. Northstar completed two more and was on track to deliver five more, after additional extensive bidding processes.\n\n\u201cAmazon alone is expected to build as many as 800 new data centers,\u201d the suit, filed by Nicole A. Westbrook, of Jones & Keller, P.C. stated. \u201cThe growth rate for data centers is expected to triple within the next three years. In sum, Mr. Watson entered the data center development market at the beginning of a modern-day Gold Rush, which has only grown massively since then.\u201d\n\nInstead, the lawsuit claims, Amazon and others, including IPI Partners based in Chicago, IL., Northstar\u2019s majority equity investor, funded by 7 billionaires of the tech industry, conspired to exclude Northstar from future data center deals to stifle competition. This was allegedly achieved by several acts, including witness tampering: bribing and pressuring Northstar\u2019s former employees to lie in depositions and \u201cconcoct false allegations against Mr. Watson and Northstar,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The complaint further alleges that Amazon exerted pressure on federal authorities to launch a criminal investigation into Watson, as he could only be contractually removed from the investments if he had pled guilty or was convicted of a felony. Neither of which occurred.\n\nAccording to court records, Amazon as the tenant, allegedly secretly signed an agreement with Northstar\u2019s majority equity investor, without Mr. Watson\u2019s knowledge as the manager of the data center investments, cutting Northstar out of lucrative data center deals, resulting in profits for Amazon.\n\nWatson and Northstar are separately suing IPI Partners and other parties for $2 billion plus additional damages in Colorado (Case No. 1:24-cv-02848) for their role in what the court documents call a mafia-like \u201cracketeering scheme,\u201d as well as Danny Mulcahy the former Northstar employee who is accused of emailing Bezos about the alleged fabricated kickback scheme, asking for a job or money in return. (Case No. 1:24-cv-02606.)\n\nIn their lawsuit against Amazon, Watson and Northstar allege the $2.3 trillion tech giant also pursued civil lawfare against them, instigating an SEC investigation. As a result of all these actions, Watson\u2019s home was subjected to an FBI raid, Northstar suffered financial losses exceeding $2 billion, all but one of the 40 employees lost their jobs, and Mr. Watson was harmed personally and professionally. According to the federal lawsuit, Watson was forcibly removed from his business assets and personal estate, as Amazon and its legal counsel filed multiple false affidavits with the Virginia Court to secure a Receiver to control and hobble Mr. Watson\u2019s assets for almost the past three years, so he could not pay to defend himself against Amazon\u2019s \u201cblitzkrieg attack.\u201d In their complaint, Watson and Northstar say Amazon and its legal counsel at Gibson Dunn later rescinded these false Affidavits for being untrue, but only after the Receiver had been appointed by the Court at Amazon\u2019s request. Alvarez and Marsal was the sole firm that Amazon asked the federal court to appoint to handle the Receivership, and the firm charged Mr. Watson\u2019s company and estate up to $450,000 per month for their supposed services, according to the suit.\n\nThe federal complaint accuses the tech giant and its associates of violating antitrust laws, RICO statutes, and other legal claims. Of the 15 claims stated in the lawsuit, this is one of the first times that an antitrust claim has ever been used against Amazon for these specific claims and seems to be the first time in American legal history that the company has been accused of colluding with the Federal Government to limit fair competition in the data center marketplace. Watson and Northstar are seeking treble damages under antitrust law, which could potentially amount to over $8 billion. Consequently, this is the largest lawsuit filed against Amazon and these executives personally since the company\u2019s founding, and is the largest lawsuit ever filed in the State of Colorado for such claims.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to build my company up from nothing for almost 20 years, and it has been heartbreaking to see how a $2.3 trillion company can manipulate and control the legal system and governmental agencies in America,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI have never been a litigious person prior to Amazon\u2019s attacks, but someone has to hold such corporate behemoths accountable, or they will continue to destroy others. My company may have been small and insignificant in their eyes, but we are filled with grit, persistence, and determination to seek justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, the DOJ ended its investigation in January of 2024. The Receivership that controlled Mr. Watson\u2019s assets was finally removed in May 2024. Additionally, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Watson and Northstar on all of Amazon\u2019s Federal claims in March 2023, leaving one state law-based claim with no alleged financial damages to Amazon, stating that those claims were not even worthy to proceed to trial.\n\nCASE INFORMATION\n\nThe United States District Court for the District of Colorado\n\nBRIAN WATSON; W.D.C.

            "content": "Google Analytics 4 (GA4) provides valuable insights into user behavior across websites and apps. But what if you need to combine GA4 data with other sources or perform deeper analysis? That\u2019s where Amazon Redshift and Amazon AppFlow come in. Amazon AppFlow bridges the gap between Google applications and Amazon Redshift, empowering organizations to unlock deeper insights and drive data-informed decisions. In this post, we show you how to establish the data ingestion pipeline between Google Analytics 4, Google Sheets, and an Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup.\n\nAmazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that you can use to securely transfer data from software as a service (SaaS) applications, such as Google BigQuery, Salesforce, SAP, HubSpot, and ServiceNow, to Amazon Web Services (AWS) services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift, in just a few clicks. With Amazon AppFlow, you can run data flows at nearly any scale and at the frequency you choose\u2014on a schedule, in response to a business event, or on demand. You can configure data transformation capabilities such as filtering and validation to generate rich, ready-to-use data as part of the flow itself, without additional steps. Amazon AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows you to restrict data from flowing over the public internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats.\n\nAmazon Redshift is a fast, scalable, and fully managed cloud data warehouse that allows you to process and run your complex SQL analytics workloads on structured and semi-structured data. It also helps you securely access your data in operational databases, data lakes, or third-party datasets with minimal movement or copying of data. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon Redshift to process large amounts of data, modernize their data analytics workloads, and provide insights for their business users.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore starting this walkthrough, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:\n\nAn AWS account.\n\nIn your Google Cloud project, you\u2019ve enabled the following APIs: Google Analytics API Google Analytics Admin API Google Analytics Data API Google Sheets API Google Drive API\n\n\n\nFor more information, refer to Amazon AppFlow support for Google Sheets.\n\nFor the steps to enable these APIs, see Enable and disable APIs on the API Console Help for Google Cloud Platform.\n\nArchitecture overview\n\nThe following architecture shows how Amazon AppFlow can transform and move data from SaaS applications to processing and storage destinations. Three sections appear from left to right in the diagram: Source, Move, Target. These sections are described in the following section.\n\nSource \u2013 The leftmost section on the diagram represents different applications acting as a source, including Google Analytics, Google Sheets, and Google BigQuery.\n\n\u2013 The leftmost section on the diagram represents different applications acting as a source, including Google Analytics, Google Sheets, and Google BigQuery. Move \u2013 The middle section is labeled Amazon AppFlow. The section contains boxes that represent Amazon AppFlow operations such as Mask Fields, Map Fields, Merge Fields, Filter Data, and others. In this post, we focus on setting up the data movement using Amazon AppFlow and filtering data based on start date. The other transformation operations such as mapping, masking, and merging fields are not covered in this post.\n\n\u2013 The middle section is labeled Amazon AppFlow. The section contains boxes that represent Amazon AppFlow operations such as Mask Fields, Map Fields, Merge Fields, Filter Data, and others. In this post, we focus on setting up the data movement using Amazon AppFlow and filtering data based on start date. The other transformation operations such as mapping, masking, and merging fields are not covered in this post. Destination \u2013 The section on the right of the diagram is labeled Destination and represents targets such as Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3. In this psot, we primarily focus on Amazon Redshift as the destination.\n\nThis post has two parts. The first part covers integrating from Google Analytics. The second part focuses on connecting with Google Sheets.\n\nApplication configuration in Google Cloud Platform\n\nAmazon AppFlow requires OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You need to create an OAuth 2.0 client ID, which Amazon AppFlow uses when requesting an OAuth 2.0 access token. To create an OAuth 2.0 client ID in the Google Cloud Platform console, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Google Cloud Platform Console, from the projects list, select a project or create a new one. If the APIs & Services page isn\u2019t already open, choose the menu icon on the upper left and select APIs & Services. In the navigation pane, choose Credentials. Choose CREATE CREDENTIALS, then choose OAuth client ID, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nSelect the application type Web application, enter the name demo-google-aws, and provide URIs for Authorized JavaScript origins https://console.aws.amazon.com . For Authorized redirect URIs, add https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth . Choose SAVE, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nThe OAuth client ID is now created. Select demo-google-aws.\n\nUnder Additional information, as shown in the following screenshot, note down the Client ID and Client secret.\n\nData ingestion from Google Analytics 4 to Amazon Redshift\n\nIn this section, you configure Amazon AppFlow to set up a connection between Google Analytics 4 and Amazon Redshift for data migration. This procedure can be classified into the following steps:\n\nCreate a connection to Google Analytics 4 in Amazon AppFlow\n\nTo create a connection to Google Analytics 4 in Amazon AppFlow, follow these steps:\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open Amazon AppFlow. In the navigation pane on the left, choose Connections. On the Manage connections page, for Connectors, choose Google Analytics 4. Choose Create connection. In the Connect to Google Analytics 4 window, enter the following information. For Client ID, enter the client ID of the OAuth 2.0 client ID in your Google Cloud project created in the previous section. For Client secret, enter the client secret of the OAuth 2.0 client ID in your Google Cloud project created in the previous section. (Optional) under Data encryption, choose Customize encryption settings (advanced) if you want to encrypt your data with a customer managed key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with an AWS KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own AWS KMS key instead.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Connect to Google Analytics 4 window.\n\nAmazon AppFlow encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see Data protection in Amazon AppFlow.\n\nIf you want to use an AWS KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under Choose an AWS KMS key. If you want to use an AWS KMS key from a different AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key:\n\nFor Connection name, enter a name for your connection Choose Continue In the window that appears, sign in to your Google account and grant access to Amazon AppFlow\n\nOn the Manage connections page, your new connection appears in the Connections table. When you create a flow that uses Google Analytics 4 as the data source, you can select this connection.\n\nCreate an IAM role for Amazon AppFlow integration with Amazon Redshift\n\nYou can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from supported sources into your Amazon Redshift databases. You need an IAM role because Amazon AppFlow needs authorization to access Amazon Redshift using an Amazon Redshift Data API.\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console, preferably as admin user, and in the navigation pane of the IAM dashboard, choose Policies. Choose Create policy. Select the JSON tab and paste in the following policy. Amazon AppFlow needs the following permissions to gain access and run SQL statements with the Amazon Redshift database.\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"DataAPIPermissions\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"redshift-data:ExecuteStatement\", \"redshift-data:GetStatementResult\", \"redshift-data:DescribeStatement\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" }, { \"Sid\": \"GetCredentialsForAPIUser\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"redshift:GetClusterCredentials\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:redshift:*:*:dbname:*/*\", \"arn:aws:redshift:*:*:dbuser:*/*\" ] }, { \"Sid\": \"GetCredentialsForServerless\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"redshift-serverless:GetCredentials\", \"Resource\": \"*\" }, { \"Sid\": \"DenyCreateAPIUser\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": \"redshift:CreateClusterUser\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:redshift:*:*:dbuser:*/*\" ] }, { \"Sid\": \"ServiceLinkedRole\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/redshift-data.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRedshift\", \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"iam:AWSServiceName\": \"redshift-data.amazonaws.com\" } } } ] }\n\nChoose Next, provide the Policy name as appflow-redshift-policy , Description as appflow redshift policy, and choose Create policy.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Roles and Create role. Choose Custom trust policy and paste in the following. Choose Next. This trust policy grants Amazon AppFlow the ability to assume the role for Amazon AppFlow to access and process data.\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"appflow.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] }\n\nSearch for policy appflow-redshift-policy , check the box next to it, and choose Next.\n\nProvide the role name appflow-redshift-access-role and Description and choose Create role.\n\nSet up Amazon AppFlow connection for Amazon Redshift\n\nTo set up an Amazon AppFlow connection for Amazon Redshift, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Amazon AppFlow console, in the navigation pane, choose Connectors, select Amazon Redshift, and choose Create connection.\n\nEnter the connection name appflow-redshift-connection. You can either use Amazon Redshift provisioned or Amazon Redshift Serverless, but in this example we are using Amazon Redshift Serverless. Select Amazon Redshift Serverless and enter the workgroup name and database name. Choose the S3 bucket and enter the bucket prefix.\n\nFor Amazon S3 access, select the IAM role attached to the Redshift cluster or namespace during the creation of the Redshift cluster. Additionally, for the Amazon Redshift Data API, choose the IAM role appflow-redshift-access-role created in the previous section and then choose\n\nSet up a table and permission in Amazon Redshift\n\nTo set up table and permission in Amazon Redshift, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Redshift console, choose Query editor v2 in Explorer. Connect to your existing Redshift cluster or Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup. Create a table with the following Data Definition Language (DDL).\n\ncreate table public.stg_ga4_daily_summary ( event_date date, region varchar(255), country varchar(255), city varchar(255), deviceCategory varchar(255), deviceModel varchar(255), browser varchar(255), active_users INTEGER, new_users integer, total_revenue NUMERIC(18,2) );\n\nThe following screenshot shows the successful creation of this table in Amazon Redshift:\n\nThe following step is only applicable to Amazon Redshift Serverless. If you are using a Redshift provisioned cluster, you can skip this step.\n\nGrant the permissions on the table to the IAM user used by Amazon AppFlow to load data into Amazon Redshift Serverless, for example, appflow-redshift-access-role .\n\nGRANT INSERT ON TABLE public.stg_ga4_daily_summary TO \"IAMR:appflow-redshift-access-role\";\n\nCreate data flow in Amazon AppFlow\n\nTo create a data flow in Amazon AppFlow, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Amazon AppFlow console, choose Flows and select Amazon Redshift. Choose Create flow and enter the flow name and the flow description, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nIn Source name, choose Google Analytics 4. Choose the Google Analytics 4 connection. Select the Google Analytics 4 object, then choose Amazon Redshift as the destination, selecting the public schema and stg_ga4_daily_summary table in your Redshift instance.\n\nFor Flow trigger, choose Run on demand and choose Next, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nYou can run the flow on schedule to pull either full or incremental data refresh. For more information, see Schedule-triggered flows.\n\nSelect Manually map fields. From the Source field name dropdown menu, select the attribute date , and from the Destination field name, select event_date and choose Map fields, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nRepeat the previous step (step 5) for the following attributes and then choose Next. The following screenshot shows the mapping.\n\nDimension:browser --> browser Dimension:region --> region Dimension:country --> country Dimension:city --> city Dimension:deviceCategory --> devicecategory Dimension:deviceModel --> devicemodel Metric:activeUsers --> active_users Metric:newUsers --> new_users Metric: totalRevenue --> total_revenue Dimension:date --> event_date\n\nThe Google Analytics API provides various dimensions and metrics for reporting purposes. Refer to API Dimensions & Metrics for details.\n\nIn Field name, enter the filter start_end_date and choose Next, as shown in the following screenshot. The Amazon AppFlow date filter supports both a start date ( criteria1 ) and an end date ( criteria2 ) to define the desired date range for data transfer. We are using the date range because we have sample data created for this range.\n\nReview the configurations and choose Create flow. Choose Run flow, as shown in the following screenshot, and wait for the flow execution to be completed.\n\nOn the Amazon Redshift console, choose Query editor v2 in Explorer. Connect to your existing Redshift cluster or Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup. Enter the following SQL to verify the data in Amazon Redshift.\n\nselect * from public.stg_ga4_daily_summary\n\nThe screenshot below shows the results loaded into the stg_ga4_daily_summary table.\n\nData ingestion from Google Sheets to Amazon Redshift\n\nIngesting data from Google Sheets to Amazon Redshift using Amazon AppFlow streamlines analytics, enabling seamless transfer and deeper insights. In this section, we demonstrate how business users can maintain their business glossary in Google Sheets and integrate that using Amazon AppFlow with Amazon Redshift and get meaningful insights.\n\nFor this demo, you can upload the Nation Market segment file to your Google sheet before proceeding to the next steps. These steps show how to configure Amazon AppFlow to set up a connection between Google Sheets and Amazon Redshift for data migration. This procedure can be classified into the following steps:\n\nCreate Google Sheets connection in Amazon AppFlow\n\nTo create a Google Sheets connection in Amazon AppFlow, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Amazon AppFlow console, choose Connectors, select Google Sheets, then choose Create connection. In the Connect to Google Sheets window, enter the following information. For Client ID, enter the client ID of the OAuth 2.0 client ID in your Google Sheets project. For Client secret, enter the client secret of the OAuth 2.0 client ID in your Google Sheets project. For Connection name, enter a name for your connection. (Optional) Under Data encryption, choose Customize encryption settings (advanced) if you want to encrypt your data with a customer managed key in AWS KMS. By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with an AWS KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own AWS KMS key instead. Choose Connect. In the window that appears, sign in to your Google account and grant access to Amazon AppFlow.\n\nSet up table and permission in Amazon Redshift\n\nTo set up a table and permission in Amazon Redshift, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Amazon Redshift console, choose Query editor v2 in Explorer Connect to your existing Redshift cluster or Amazon Redshift Serverless workgroup Create a table with the following DDL\n\ncreate table public.stg_nation_market_segment( n_nationkey int4 not null, n_name char(25) not null , n_regionkey int4 not null, n_comment varchar(152) not null, n_marketsegment varchar(255), Primary Key(N_NATIONKEY) ) distkey(n_nationkey) sortkey(n_nationkey);\n\nhe following steps are only applicable to Amazon Redshift Serverless. If you are using a Redshift provisioned cluster, you can skip this step.\n\nGrant the permissions on the table to the IAM user used by Amazon AppFlow to load data into Amazon Redshift Serverless, for example, appflow-redshift-access-role\n\nGRANT INSERT ON TABLE public.stg_nation_market_segment TO \"IAMR:appflow-redshift-access-role\";\n\nCreate data flow in Amazon AppFlow\n\nOn the Amazon AppFlow console, choose Flows and select Google Sheets.

            "content": "One gingerbread house in Charlotte stood out from others built across the nation this holiday season. Out front, a spiced-cookie figure in a safety vest like those worn by Amazon workers tended a prone gingerbread person wrapped in a Band-Aid. The candy-studded construction stood inside an Amazon warehouse last week after an internal gingerbread building contest for workers. It was part of a corporate feel-good blitz aimed at boosting morale during the mandatory extra hours the company requires during the holidays.\n\nAs many white-collar workers log back on to work after the holiday break, Amazon staffers are reeling from the annual crush known internally as \u201cpeak,\u201d which runs from November\u2019s Black Friday discounts through the flood of returned gifts in January. Managers in one Ohio warehouse felt the need to post a notice reminding workers to shower and use deodorant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon tried to soften the impact of its extra demands in Charlotte this year with the gingerbread house contest, raffles, free T-shirts and a holiday meal catered by Golden Corral, said Aleasha Reese, 65.\n\nAround the country, workers also received incentive pay and free drinks from 7-Eleven, and won prizes like water bottles and stress balls from roving \u201cswag carts.\u201d They were also invited to submit videos for a global \u201cUnbox Your Talent\u201d competition offering trophies and raffle prizes. It was ultimately won by a German employee with a talent for balancing.\n\nReese, who has worked at Amazon for seven years and won a TV during a previous peak season, said the perks have declined in quality. \u201cThe stuff they was giving out wasn\u2019t worth it\u201d this year, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, y\u2019all done made a billion dollars, and this is all you can offer for a prize?\u201d\n\nPeak rolls around inside Amazon each year as millions of consumers have come to rely on the company as a way to score deals after Thanksgiving and source convenient holiday gifts in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe jump in orders is huge. Amazon said that one Massachusetts delivery station that usually receives up to 65,000 packages daily handles more than 100,000 each day during the holidays.\n\nThe strain placed on workers during peak can be serious. In July, a Senate report found that workplace injuries increase during Amazon\u2019s busy seasons.\n\nJust before Christmas, an overwhelmed Amazon delivery driver in Massachusetts abandoned more than 80 packages in the woods and later told police they had been \u201cstressed.\u201d Amazon said all the packages were ultimately delivered on time.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said during peak, Amazon places \u201can extra emphasis on recognizing, honoring, and celebrating our employees for their commitment to safety, teamwork, and service to our customers,\u201d and that employees are encouraged to share ideas for new appreciation programs with local managers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get those millions of holiday packages where they\u2019re going on schedule, Amazon implements what the company calls Mandatory Extra Time. Employees can have an extra 45 minutes added to their usual shift, or in some cases be required to work five eleven-hour shifts rather than their usual four ten-hour shifts, workers said.\n\nIn a November message to workers at one Amazon facility, management warned \u201cpeak season is just around the corner \u2026 there is a potential risk of working up to 60 hours per week.\u201d\n\nAmazon said employees are paid overtime for any additional hours, and can\u2019t be asked to work more than 60 hours in one week, 12 hours in a single day, or six days in a row.\n\nSome Amazon sites also offer additional incentive pay, such as $50 extra per shift or an added $5 an hour for holiday overtime. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time for people who want to get extra money,\u201d said an employee at a Florida delivery station, who like most other Amazon workers interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of full or partial anonymity to protect their job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut some workers say the grueling pace of peak can take a toll that worsens the already taxing environment inside Amazon facilities.\n\nAt more than seven delivery stations and fulfillment centers in New York, Southern California, San Francisco, Illinois and Georgia this year, peak games and promotions unfolded while members of the Teamsters union picketed outside and some Amazon workers walked off the job to demand higher pay, better working conditions, and for Amazon to bargain on a contract with workers who\u2019ve voted to unionize.\n\nIn addition to spreading corporate holiday cheer, many of Amazon\u2019s peak season perks are intended to ensure that workers spend more time on the job.\n\nAt the delivery station in Florida this year, a contest called \u201cclock in to win\u201d entered workers into a prize raffle if they stayed at work through their entire scheduled shift, the worker at the site told The Post. The game encouraged workers not to use vacation time to clock out of shifts early during peak, as Amazon typically allows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon employees can also win raffle tickets during peak for perfect attendance, hitting productivity goals or answering safety questions on their personal phones or handheld work devices, current Amazon workers said.\n\n\u201cWelcome to our Peak Game Series!,\u201d said one message to Amazon workers in Charlotte seen by The Post. \u201cYou will receive a secret code after completing each game.

This year, they received $5 tips from customers nudged to thank their drivers via Amazon\u2019s shopping app, and coupons for free drinks from 7-Eleven each week to help them \u201cstay warm and refreshed,\u201d according to a screenshot of an announcement posted online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your dedication to delivering to customers during this holiday season and beyond,\u201d it said.\n\nSome Amazon managers appear aware of how the seasonal pressure can impact staff. In a notice posted in one warehouse in Ohio this year and seen by The Post, local managers offered tips for staying on top of personal hygiene during \u201call the stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry to shower at least every other day, deodorant can go a long way!\u201d the notice read. \u201cBrush your teeth first thing after waking up and right before you go to sleep.

            "content": "Amazon employees returned to the office for the first full week of in-person work since 2020 in what will be a closely watched directive for multiple reasons involving Seattle\u2019s largest employer.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy signaled the mandate last fall, noting that collaboration and productivity are better when people are working side-by-side.\n\nThe decision, which impacts roughly 50,000 employees, has ramifications for traffic, small businesses, and office vacancies in Seattle. There has also been grumbling amongst employees who have uprooted their lives with the ability to work remotely and now face longer commutes to the office.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u201cI agree it's hard, you know, I was not a fan at first when the announcement was made, and I worried about what it was going to be like to re-establish those rhythms and those routines,\u201d said Rena Palumbo, an AWS manager. \u201cBut I also think that it's important for us to keep that human connection, and it's really hard to collaborate and to build relationships with others behind a screen from your house all the time. I've found, personally, I feel more connected to people today.\u201d\n\nThere have been businesses near the campus that are banking on a return to normalcy. Mikayla Benedict runs the \u201cHouse of Eve\u201d restaurant and bar near the campus.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to keep this place open long-term,\u201d said Benedict. \u201cI think it's going to save a lot of businesses because I don't think I'm the only one who's just trying to hang on.\u201d Benedict acknowledged that Amazonians are her key customers, and she\u2019s watched as coffee shops have struggled without the constant foot traffic. \u201cIt'll be cool to see people's dreams come back. So it won't feel like an empty city anymore.\u201d\n\nCivic and business leaders also are hoping Amazon can help fuel the rebirth of downtown. After all, you can stand at the Spheres and see Pacific Place, which has been more than half empty and struggling to find tenants after being one of the hottest spots in town in the late 90s and early 2000s. The retail core has also dwindled as companies have moved to work-from-home models and freed up office space. According to Colliers, there was a 30% office vacancy rate in Seattle in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u201cI think their move to come back to the office five days a week is a big, influential, and significant signal to other employers. They've been wrestling with some of the same considerations and dynamics since the pandemic,\u201d said Jon Scholes of the Downtown Seattle Association.\n\nScholes seemed less concerned about an increase in vehicular traffic. Inrix, which has long tracked transportation data, said that traffic delays increased 35% at key hubs after Amazon returned to a three-day-a-week model.\n\n\u201cThankfully, there are more ways to get here than just in your car, and we've got more train service, more bus service than we had a year ago, and certainly more service than we had four years ago,\u201d said Scholes. \u201cThere's more options to get in and out of downtown and move around than you had if you were working downtown pre pandemic.\u201d",

            "content": "An estimated 600 Amazon workers went on a short strike or participated in pickets from December 19 to Christmas Eve across eight warehouse locations, from Queens to San Francisco. The coordinated mobilization was an opening salvo to Amazon, and a test of capacity for the Teamsters\u2019 growing national network.\n\nThe union says it represents between 7,000 and 10,000 Amazon workers, either by authorization election or majority demand for recognition: a fulfillment center on Staten Island, an air hub in Southern California, a delivery station warehouse in San Francisco, and a handful of delivery contractors. It had given the company a deadline to begin bargaining with all these workers, though no one expected Amazon to actually fold over the holidays.\n\nThe Teamsters also recruited stewards, retirees, and rank-and-file UPS workers to picket entrances to dozens of Amazon fulfillment warehouses nationwide. Picket-line extensions generally were handled by local officers and staff, and their effectiveness varied.\n\nAmazon employs 740,000 workers across its warehouses and distribution centers, and 390,000 drivers nominally employed by 4,400 contractors, called Delivery Service Partners; Amazon retains full control of their operations.\n\nThe holiday strike was perfectly timed for peak season at Amazon\u2014but unfortunately also for when reporters go on vacation and newsrooms are on low staffing for the holidays, though the Teamsters succeeded in nabbing positive national headlines.\n\nHow extensive was the impact on production? In my reporting for In These Times, I was able to answer the question: some dips in volume, but not enough to exact a cost on Amazon\u2019s promise of timely delivery. These walkouts did reveal new leaders and stiffen the spines of existing ones, though.\n\nAn equally important metric is strike participation. On Christmas Eve, I could offer only snapshots of what I saw on picket lines I visited, but since then, I\u2019ve pieced together as comprehensive as possible an estimate of the strike numbers, drawing on a network of worker contacts at Amazon who spoke to me on background. Where workers declined to speak for fear of upsetting higher-ups in the Teamsters, I have supplemented my on-the-ground reporting with the picket visits of supporters.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of worker participation. The Teamsters international didn\u2019t respond to a request for how many workers received strike pay, which is another useful measure of participation.\n\nQUEENS DRIVERS JOINED\n\nA delivery station is a small warehouse, the last stop in Amazon\u2019s logistics chain, where packages are dispatched to the drivers who deliver them.\n\nAt the DBK4 delivery station in Queens, New York, 200 drivers struck, including 190 who did their full picket-line duty, meaning they walked the picket all five days, and 10 who participated only partially, opting to stay home or cross the line. Eight DSPs operate out of the Queens location, with a total workforce of 700 to 800 drivers.\n\nAt the same location, two dozen warehouse workers joined the strike the morning of December 21, out of 120 or more. Workers there have been leading walkouts over the past three years, but this one had the strongest participation yet, and was the first to include drivers.\n\n\u201cWe have stronger, more experienced leaders,\u201d said one of the strikers, who has been at Amazon for five years. \u201cAnd the people in the warehouse see it. They\u2019re gonna see us come back to work and they\u2019re gonna see Amazon\u2019s full of shit and that the union is not this outside group, it\u2019s these people who went on strike and are now working next to them on the belt.\u201d\n\nON STATEN ISLAND, DUES LIES HURT\n\nAt the mammoth JFK8 fulfillment center on Staten Island, estimates of strike participation ranged from 150 to 350. Days earlier, Amazon Labor Union-IBT Local 1 President Connor Spence had said in a statement that 700 workers had pledged to strike. The facility had expanded its workforce for the holidays from 5,500 to more than 6,000. Nationwide Amazon hired 250,000 seasonal workers.\n\nAt Local 1\u2019s union hall before midnight on December 20, Vice President Brima Sylla was preparing to lead workers out: \u201cWe\u2019ll be making sure we get most of the workers from all the departments, from inbound to outbound to shipdock.\u201d\n\nBut once he got inside the facility, Sylla said, managers pulled him into a meeting, delaying the walkout. As I stood outside with a gaggle of reporters and supporters, the cops asked people to leave and began checking Amazon IDs. I hid behind a car as the cops marched the other reporters off the property. Once the coast was clear, I recorded the walkout. Fourteen workers walked out a little before 1 a.m., while a dozen more waited outside cheering.\n\nThe picket lines swelled to hundreds, counting supporters, including many from the Democratic Socialists of America, which rented three buses. Workers per picket shift numbered about 30 to 50.\n\nWith freezing sleet falling, Ken Coates said some of his co-workers were too intimidated to take part. He said Amazon had threatened workers that if their unpaid time off (UPT) ran out, they would be terminated. It is illegal for Amazon to fire workers for striking, and likely illegal to threaten to do so.\n\nThe company also spread lies about the union deducting dues even without a contract\u2014a misrepresentation of the voluntary dues that the union is encouraging.\n\n\u201cA lot of our co-workers are still scared,\u201d said Coates. \u201cBut hopefully with this community support, they\u2019ll be encouraged to come together.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s insistence on docking workers for UPT when they strike has been a big challenge at warehouses because it effectively reduces the duration of strikes and interferes with workers\u2019 federal right to engage in concerted activity. Workers have filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, but the company keeps violating their rights while stalling in the courts.\n\n\u201cWhen we try to explain to people they have these protections, it\u2019s difficult also to reconcile that with the messaging that in another area of the law, Amazon\u2019s obligation to bargain, they\u2019re breaking it,\u201d said Spence. \u201cAnd so then we had to pivot the conversation, helping people understand the laws exist, and they do protect us to a certain degree, but the real protection we have when we engage in these kinds of actions is the power of numbers.\u201d\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nAt the Southern California air hub KSBD, 100 workers struck. The facility employs about 1,000.\n\nIn the Atlanta area, an estimated 30 drivers struck, at one of the three DSPs that operate out of the DGT8 delivery station. Amazon caps the workforce of each DSP at 80 to 120 drivers.\n\nAt the San Francisco DCK6 delivery station, 20 out of 160 warehouse workers struck.\n\nIn Southern California, the Teamsters count the delivery station DAX8 as one of the struck facilities, but these workers had actually been fired in 2023. After workers unionized at the DSP, Battle-Tested Strategies, Amazon canceled its contract, firing all 84 drivers; Amazon was the company\u2019s only client, and it hasn\u2019t operated since. (Amazon pulled the same stunt in 2017 when drivers organized at a DSP in Detroit.) Some of the fired workers have since traveled the country spreading picket line extensions.\n\nSUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $10 a month or more and get our \"Fight the Boss, Build the Union\" T-shirt.\n\nIn the Chicago area, the delivery station DIL7 had 80 drivers on picket duty, including workers whose DSP contract had been canceled last June as well as workers from the other three active DSP contractors. The workers there extended picket lines to four other facilities.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to secure numbers for drivers at another delivery station in Southern California, DFX4.\n\nWorkers didn\u2019t strike at an air hub in Kentucky, and at locations where the worker committees are only loosely affiliated with the Teamsters, including a fulfillment center in the Hudson Valley of New York and a delivery station in Pontiac, Michigan, where workers previously walked off the job.\n\nMeanwhile on December 23, after three years of organizing, the independent union Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment filed for election at a huge fulfillment center in North Carolina.\n\nA FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM?\n\nNo doubt the Teamsters have inflated the rhetoric in calling these \u201chistoric\u201d and the \u201clargest\u201d strikes at Amazon. But the strikes weren\u2019t fake or astroturfed, either.\n\nMany of the facilities that participated in the strike were part of formerly independent organizing efforts led by rank-and-file workers and salts. Besides the ALU at the JFK8 fulfillment center in New York, all of the following have now joined the Teamsters: Amazonians United NYC at DBK4; Amazonians United ATL at DGT8; the Kentucky air hub KCVG, which had been loosely affiliated with ALU; and the air hub KSBD in California, which until recently was an independent organizing effort by the Inland Empire Amazon Workers United and loosely affiliated with Amazonians United.\n\nThe Teamsters union has increasingly gotten more serious about taking the fight to Amazon, not just rhetorically but also by investing in the organizing push. One piece of that is using picket line extensions to get regional councils and locals on board.\n\nIn a December 23 appearance on the racist nationalist commentator Tucker Carlson\u2019s YouTube show, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien said the fight at Amazon is going to take time. \u201cWe\u2019ve put together a program,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a four- or five-year program. Every single day we are building momentum. We\u2019re building worker power.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s overtures to far-right figures like Carlson who are stoking nativist nationalism present an obstacle to the organizing at Amazon, where Black, Latino, and immigrant workers make up a majority of the multiethnic workforce. O\u2019Brien has been cozying up to Donald Trump and appeared last summer at the Republican National Convention where the crowd waved \u201cDeport Them Now\u201d signs.\n\nBUILDING A SAND CASTLE\n\nThe central challenge at Amazon, for Teamsters and independent unions alike, is how to build a durable organization in a workplace with an annual churn of 150 percent. Organizing there can be like building a sand castle on a beach shore only to watch subsequent waves wash it away.\n\nAmazonians United\u2019s core strategy has been to build power through minority actions, what the late historian Mike Davis called \u201cthe ceaseless guerrilla warfare against management\u2019s despotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think big but start small, building on wins that grow our confidence in taking greater risks over time,\u201d members of the network wrote in Labor Notes in 2020, after running petition campaigns, marching on the boss, and organizing walkouts in multiple states.\n\nROBOTICS IS KEY\n\nLast summer during Prime Week, almost 100 Amazon workers at the air hub KCVG in northern Kentucky walked off the job, reportedly forcing the company to reroute planes. One striker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told me that the airport usually handles between 350,000 to 400,000 packages on a typical day. The day of the strike, he said, packages dropped to 297,000.\n\nManagement \u201cdid everything they could to make sure that either people didn\u2019t participate or that people didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen that building run as smooth and efficient. [All the packages for the shift] were done by noon. We did impact their production that day as far as what they normally would have done, because they had to pawn it off on somebody else or just cancel it entirely.\u201d\n\nWhile a majority of the airport\u2019s 4,000 workers didn\u2019t participate, the minority strike brought out key personnel in Amazon\u2019s robotics (AR) department. \u201cAll the packages come up to AR, and then they go on to a robot, and the robot takes it to a chute, and the chute kicks it down to wherever it is going,\u201d the worker explained. \u201cYou don't need 2,000 or 3,000 people to walk out.\n\n\u201cYou need AR, or most of it, and especially your AFMs, your Amnesty Floor Monitors. They\u2019re the ones that go out and fix the robots when they bomb out or whatever. And there\u2019s only about six of those at a given time.\u201d\n\nThe key groups are tug drivers, maintenance engineers, and robotics, this worker said: \u201cIf those three groups leave, that building stops.\u201d\n\nDespite the waves crashing against the sand castle, small committees have begun piecing together intel like this and building tiny beachheads of shop floor power. Knitting them together, and then massively scaling up, will be one of the most formidable labor struggles of the 21st century.",

The situation has left residents questioning who is responsible for the abandoned deliveries.\n\nTrinity Nieto, a Montgomery resident, told FOX 26 that she and her family were out on a walk in the Fairwater subdivision on January 3 when they noticed a delivery truck parked on a sidewalk next to an empty lot. \"He had just enough time to dump two packages, peel off one of the labels, and he dipped off,\" Nieto said, explaining that the driver left quickly after abandoning the packages.\n\nAmong the items found was a large package meant for a woman in Walden, which the Nietos later found out contained a gift for her newborn baby. Their discovery added to mounting frustration among local residents, who reported similar incidents over the past several months. .\n\nAmazon has acknowledged the issue, stating that they are investigating the matter. A company spokesperson confirmed they are working with local law enforcement to address the situation.

The duo\u2019s reset took a new twist with Amazon\u2019s announcement that it would release a documentary on Melania Trump shot by an outcast filmmaker, and more tumult at The Washington Post.\n\nBut Bezos, like other business leaders, has been moving closer to the president-elect, and the decisions are inevitably being analyzed in that context.\n\nAmazon called it a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d look at Trump \u2014 but she will have a big say. The documentary will be released this year on its Prime Video service and in theaters; filming began after the election. Melania is an executive producer, suggesting that she will be able to shape the narrative.\n\nThe documentary was directed by Brett Ratner, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Ratner is the high-profile director and producer of films such as \u201cRush Hour\u201d and \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d But he disappeared from Hollywood after six women leveled accusations against him that Ratner denied. He has resurfaced after entering Trump\u2019s orbit.

            "content": "Amazon Prime Video\u2019s inaugural NBA studio coverage will feature former NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Blake Griffin, according to sources briefed on the streamer\u2019s plans.\n\nAmazon signed Griffin and Nowitzki to join host Taylor Rooks when the platform begins its NBA package later this calendar year. Amazon will start its 11-year, nearly $20 billion agreement with the NBA during the 2025-26 season. The Athletic\u2019s Richard Deitsch previously reported that Rooks would be the host.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon has already tabbed Ian Eagle as the platform\u2019s lead play-by-play caller. Amazon will move into new territory of the sports streaming evolution and have the highest level of major postseason action on the medium as six conference finals will air exclusively on the platform. It has not yet been determined whom Eagle will be paired with.\n\nWhile these are some of the initial hires for Amazon, it is far from done as it needs to add more game-callers and analysts. The streamer has held talks with Dwyane Wade about a position with studio and/or game duties in play, sources briefed on the discussions said.\n\nAmazon declined comment on the moves.\n\nGO DEEPER The eye-popping $77 billion haul that shook up the NBA landscape \u2014 and the future of media\n\nAmazon\u2019s NBA hires seem to follow the same route as its NFL \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d package. Eagle is similar to Al Michaels in that Eagle will give the live games instant credibility.\n\nOn the studio side, Amazon\u2019s NFL crew went with mostly newcomers, centered around former players Ryan Fitzpatrick, Andrew Whitworth and Richard Sherman, trying to put forth a younger presentation compared to the established networks. Nowitzki and Griffin would be in the same vein as ex-players. Nowitzki\u2019s addition could also be targeted as Amazon may feature European stars on potential daytime broadcasts in the U.S. that are primetime in Europe.\n\nThe NBA TV free agency game is in flux with TNT Sports exiting the game space and with NBC/Peacock and Amazon joining ABC/ESPN as the trio of platforms to present the leagues\u2019 action over the next decade-plus. ESPN, the incumbent remaining in the new arrangement, has already fired the first salvo by importing TNT\u2019s iconic \u201cInside The NBA.\u201d While Shaquille O\u2019Neal remains unsigned, the two sides have moved closer to an agreement, according to sources briefed on discussions, and the expectation is that he will remain on the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Barkley recently muddied the waters by saying on \u201cThe Dan Patrick Show\u201d he was still talking with NBC and Amazon about moving on from \u201cInside The NBA.\u201d Barkley had previously told The Athletic that he is in the midst of a 10-year, $210 million contract with TNT. TNT is leasing the show to ESPN, and the \u201cInside The NBA\u201d crew is still expected to be on TNT Sports.\n\nESPN continues to figure out its No. 1 game crew for this NBA season. While incumbents Mike Breen and Doris Burke are set, the network has held tryouts to add a third person to the group for this year\u2019s NBA Finals. Richard Jefferson, Jay Bilas and Tim Legler have auditioned, and Jefferson has been considered the favorite. However, it could be a one-year arrangement with ESPN realigning again when its new deal goes into effect. Amazon has shown some interest in Jefferson, according to sources briefed on the discussions.\n\nNBC will have Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle as its lead play-by-play callers. The network has also hired Jamal Crawford as a game analyst, though what number he is on the depth chart has not yet been determined. NBC has also had talks with Reggie Miller.\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Photo: Adam Pantozzi / NBAE via Getty Images)",

            "content": "Could Amazon stock be the key to your financial future? Check out why this company might be a cornerstone in your portfolio.\n\nE-commerce pioneer Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) stock has been a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Share prices soared more than 50% in three of the last eight years, mixed in with a 50% drop in 2022. The company soared amid the golden e-commerce era of coronavirus lockdowns, but came back to earth with a bang when the world got back to work and made Amazon's shipping network upgrade look frivolous.\n\nAgainst that mottled backdrop, last year's 44% price gain almost looks calm:\n\nBut that's all history at this point. On Jan. 3, 2025, Amazon sports a $2.35 trillion market cap, and investors want to know where it can go from here.\n\nAmazon's solid foundation and new ideas\n\nIn some ways, Amazon looks ready to continue doing business as usual. The shipping infrastructure is growing again after a correction in 2023.\n\nThe Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events broke records with a 10% year-over-year sales jump. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion and generates about 60% of Amazon's operating profits nowadays. International sales are growing faster than the domestic retail segment, indicating a healthy global expansion.\n\nAt the same time, this habitual innovator keeps coming up with new business ideas. For example, Amazon's machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) features are growing sales much faster than the AWS system ever did. Clients can buy computing time with high-performance Nvidia chips or save money with Amazon's proprietary AI accelerators. The company's pharmacy services will reach more than half of the U.S. population in 2025, stealing market share in an industry where more than 90% of prescriptions are served by physical stores.\n\nExpect the unexpected\n\nHere's Amazon's most important quality. The company keeps surprising me, and I love it.\n\nAWS looked like a hobby at first but has grown into a gigantic business.\n\nOne-day shipping services never struck me as a profitable idea, but Amazon proved me wrong and followed up with same-day deliveries.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market buyout came out of the blue in 2017. By now, Amazon has integrated the upscale grocery chain into its shipping systems. The related online food shopping service recently expanded from nonperishables to fresh stuff such as eggs and milk.\n\nDon't forget that this global business empire started as a small bookstore business with big dreams. Everything outside that core business may have seemed silly at first, but Amazon's out-of-the-box thinking often brings robust financial results.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, this flexibility is the best thing about Amazon. Management may not get every decision right, and the road to long-term growth is always full of potholes. But Amazon knows how to adapt to changing times, often leading the broader market from the front.\n\nI can't wait to see what Amazon comes up with next, and how unheard-of ideas might set the company up for many decades of future success.\n\nInvesting in Amazon for the long haul\n\nSome stocks deliver quick price spikes but fade away in the long run. Others can deliver robust yet modest results for ages. Amazon strikes a thrilling balance between these extremes, combining strong growth prospects with the promise of sticking around for the long haul.\n\nThis is one of the very few stocks I could stick in a retirement portfolio and leave untouched forever. Mind you, I still prefer a properly diversified stock portfolio with a generous helping of market-tracking index funds, but Amazon is one of those rare high-quality stocks you can build a strategy around.\n\nIn other words, I do expect this stock to match or beat the broader market for decades. I can't guarantee that any single stock will set you up for life -- but Amazon comes close. If nothing else, this stock deserves your consideration as part of a complete Wall Street breakfast.",

            "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nAmazon's first day back in the office felt like any other Thursday. Which is to say, none too busy in downtown Seattle.\n\nIn Seattle's South Lake Union and Denny Triangle neighborhoods\u2014home to Amazon's largest corporate campus with more than 50,000 employees\u2014bundled-up Amazonians trickled into office towers throughout the morning and streamed out at lunchtime to visit food trucks.\n\nLines formed but didn't fill the sidewalks. The neighborhood was still quiet after the New Year's holiday.\n\nThough a seemingly normal day on the outside, Thursday marked a big change for Amazon employees. They will now be expected to work from the office five days a week, an increase from the three-day mandate Amazon has had in place since May 2023.\n\nThe new requirement makes Amazon one of the strictest companies in the region and among its tech rivals when it comes to in-person work.\n\nAmazon leadership has argued that in-person work allows employees to better collaborate, learn and innovate, and that the past year and a half of a partial in-person mandate has solidified that conviction. But some employees have pushed back on the requirement, asking the company through petitions and letters to restore the flexibility of remote work. Some workers have quit while others say they are starting to look for new jobs.\n\nIn Seattle, business groups are hopeful Amazon's increased return will spur a revitalization of the business corridor that has struggled to regain its pre-pandemic vibrancy without office workers.\n\nAt King Leroy, a restaurant and bar housed in Amazon's Doppler tower in Denny Triangle, general manager Nik Taylor said he's considering staffing up to meet the new demand from Amazon employees.\n\nBecause of its location, King Leroy is unusual, Taylor said. \"I've never worked at a place that depended on people coming back to the office.\"\n\nTaylor estimated up to 90% of the restaurant's lunch regulars are Amazon employees, and he expects to see an uptick in business as those regulars bring in the rest of their team. Right now, King Leroy makes most of its money during the dinner hour, Taylor said. But with Amazon's return, the lunch rush could become the breadwinner.\n\n\"Everything has been going up exponentially every year since we opened in 2022,\" he said. \"Sales, foot traffic \u2026 it continues to grow.\"\n\nIn November, downtown Seattle saw an average of 91,000 workers per weekday, according to data from the Downtown Seattle Association, a trade organization representing businesses in the area. That's up 5% from November 2023, but just 56% of November 2019's average, before the pandemic sent most workers home.\n\n\"Downtown's largest employer bringing people back more frequently is a home run for downtown,\" said Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association. \"Other employers may take notice and make similar moves, and downtown is ready for their return.\"\n\nDavid Gurry, an office broker with real estate firm Kidder Mathews, similarly said Amazon's decisiveness has inspired other businesses to solidify their own return-to-office plans.\n\nAfter years of business owners being reluctant to sign a lease because they didn't know how much space they would need to accommodate a hybrid workforce, Gurry said he's starting to see transactions cross the finish line.\n\n\"It's been four years of people scratching their heads and not knowing what they need,\" Gurry said. \"Now business owners are ready to draw the line in the sand. \u2026 They know who's coming in and when.\"\n\nA lot of times, what they need is less office space, Gurry said, estimating that downtown Seattle's office vacancy rate would grow from 30% to 40% over the next year and a half. But he was optimistic the vacancies would fill up because high supply meant tenants could secure a good deal.\n\nIn Seattle, office building visits in 2024 were highest on Wednesdays, according to data from Placer.ai and provided by Kidder Mathews.\n\nTuesday claimed the second-highest number of visits, with Monday trailing in third, ahead of Thursday and Friday.\n\nLeah Masson, a senior director at commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, said she expects South Lake Union will experience some \"recovery pains,\" like traffic jams and long coffee lines.\n\nBut she's happy to spend more time waiting. She sees it as a sign the neighborhoods are coming back to life.\n\nOn Thursday, an Amazon employee outside of the Spheres, said they also expected the return to be an adjustment and a \"learning curve.\"\n\nBut that employee, a 15-year Amazon veteran who asked to remain anonymous to protect their job, said the company had already made one adjustment at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and could do so again.\n\n\"I understand why the company wants it. I have seen the benefits of (RTO), of in-person collaboration,\" the employee said. \"But I know it's hard for some people. \u2026 I see both sides of the coin.\"\n\nAmazon said Thursday that teams across the company are working to make sure the return to office is smooth.\n\nAnother Amazon employee, a software engineer who started in 2021 and also asked to remain anonymous, wasn't as optimistic. They plan to start searching for new jobs as a result of the in-person requirement.\n\nThe worker was in \"disbelief\" when they heard Amazon's new plans, and now they're seeing other companies promote hybrid jobs. The employee pointed to Spotify, which said recently that it would maintain its remote work policy and thought of in-person requirements as treating employees like children.\n\n\"It just really limits the flexibility,\" the Amazon employee said of the company's new mandate. \"The five-day announcement felt surreal.\"\n\nThere's still uncertainty about how the new policy will be enforced and whether the company will require workers to be in the office for a minimum number of hours each day.\n\nWhen announcing the change in September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees the expectation going forward \"is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances.\"\n\nIn December, Amazon delayed the return for workers in at least seven cities around the country as it prepared its offices for the surge in traffic. Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond, which Amazon considers its primary headquarters, do not appear to be affected by the delay.\n\n2025 The Seattle Times. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

            "content": "E-commerce pioneer Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has been a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Share prices soared more than 50% in three of the last eight years, mixed in with a 50% drop in 2022. The company soared amid the golden e-commerce era of coronavirus lockdowns, but came back to earth with a bang when the world got back to work and made Amazon's shipping network upgrade look frivolous.\n\nAgainst that mottled backdrop, last year's 44% price gain almost looks calm:\n\nData collected from Google Finance. Chart by author.\n\nBut that's all history at this point. On Jan. 3, 2025, Amazon sports a $2.35 trillion market cap, and investors want to know where it can go from here.\n\nAmazon's solid foundation and new ideas\n\nIn some ways, Amazon looks ready to continue doing business as usual. The shipping infrastructure is growing again after a correction in 2023.\n\nThe Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events broke records with a 10% year-over-year sales jump. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion and generates about 60% of Amazon's operating profits nowadays. International sales are growing faster than the domestic retail segment, indicating a healthy global expansion.\n\nAt the same time, this habitual innovator keeps coming up with new business ideas. For example, Amazon's machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) features are growing sales much faster than the AWS system ever did. Clients can buy computing time with high-performance Nvidia chips or save money with Amazon's proprietary AI accelerators. The company's pharmacy services will reach more than half of the U.S. population in 2025, stealing market share in an industry where more than 90% of prescriptions are served by physical stores.\n\nExpect the unexpected\n\nHere's Amazon's most important quality. The company keeps surprising me, and I love it.\n\nAWS looked like a hobby at first but has grown into a gigantic business.\n\nOne-day shipping services never struck me as a profitable idea, but Amazon proved me wrong and followed up with same-day deliveries.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market buyout came out of the blue in 2017. By now, Amazon has integrated the upscale grocery chain into its shipping systems. The related online food shopping service recently expanded from nonperishables to fresh stuff such as eggs and milk.\n\nDon't forget that this global business empire started as a small bookstore business with big dreams. Everything outside that core business may have seemed silly at first, but Amazon's out-of-the-box thinking often brings robust financial results.\n\nStory Continues",

The project lists both Melania Trump and Fernando Sulichin as executive producers. Brett Ratner will direct the film \u2014 he is a co-owner of RatPac Entertainment, which was once associated with former Trump Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to share this truly unique story with our millions of customers around the world,\u201d the Amazon spokesperson added.\n\nThe announcement comes just months after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in November, and just two weeks before the couple is set to return to the White House for a second term.\n\nThe relationship between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 businesses and Trump has come under scrutiny in recent weeks due to a perceived new coziness between the two men.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos. Alberto Rodriguez / NBC file\n\nBezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon in 2021 but still serves as the company\u2019s executive chairman. The billionaire also owns The Washington Post newspaper and Blue Origin, an aerospace company.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, there were a number of high-profile clashes between the then-president and Bezos or his companies.\n\nFor example, in a 2019 lawsuit, Amazon alleged Trump launched \u201cbehind-the-scenes attacks\u201d against the company. The company claimed that public and private attacks from the then-president led it to lose out on a major cloud services contract for Amazon Web Services.\n\nLast week, a cartoonist at the Post, Ann Telnaes, shared publicly that she quit her job at the newspaper after she was blocked from publishing a satirical cartoon about tech CEOs, including Bezos, kneeling before the president-elect.\n\nThe other CEOs in the cartoon, Telnaes said, were Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Los Angeles Times publisher Patrick Soon-Shiong.\n\nZuckerberg, Bezos, Altman and others have each pledged to donate $1 million to the president-elect\u2019s inauguration committee.\n\nWashington Post editorial page editor David Shipley pushed back on the notion that Telnaes\u2019 cartoon was canned because of Bezos.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Shipley said, \u201cMy decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column \u2014 this one a satire \u2014 for publication. The only bias was against repetition.\u201d\n\nTelnaes\u2019 revelation came just months after Post readers and current and former staff members criticized the paper for announcing that it would no longer endorse presidential candidates.\n\nIn their own reporting, Post journalists wrote that the publication\u2019s editorial board had decided to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. The same article reported that Bezos himself made the decision to stop endorsing candidates.\n\nIn a piece published days later on the newspaper\u2019s website, Bezos wrote, \u201cPresidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, \u2018I\u2019m going with Newspaper A\u2019s endorsement.\u2019 None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it\u2019s the right one.\u201d\n\nBezos did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment about whether he was at all involved with securing the licensing for the forthcoming Melania Trump documentary.",

            "content": "Amazon is getting into business with Melania Trump. And Brett Ratner.\n\nThe studio has confirmed that its Prime Video has exclusively licensed an upcoming documentary film on the former and incoming first lady that will be directed by Ratner. A studio spokesperson calls the film \u201can unprecedented, behind-the-scenes look\u201d at the first lady and third wife of Donald Trump.\n\nThe film will receive both a theatrical and streaming release and will be participatory in every sense given that Melania Trump will executive produce alongside New Element Media\u2019s Fernando Sulichin. Filming began in December 2024, one month after former President Donald Trump won a decisive victory to return to the White House.\n\nAmazon is planning a release in the second half of 2025.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPerhaps the most controversial element of the new project involves Ratner, who hasn\u2019t worked on major Hollywood productions since 2017, when the \u201cRush Hour\u201d helmer was accused of sexual misconduct by six women in a Los Angeles Times expose. Warner Bros., where he had a first-look deal, severed ties with him. (He denied the claims.) Separately, a former assistant at a major talent agency accused him of rape in a Facebook post, which Ratner denied. (He sued the accuser for defamation, and both sides eventually dropped their claims.) At the time, he said: \u201cIn light of the allegations being made, I am choosing to personally step away from all Warner Bros.-related activities. I don\u2019t want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved.\u201d\n\nHe also was deeply involved in a sprawling sex scandal that led to Kevin Tsujihara stepping down from his CEO post at Warner Bros. in 2019 In that case, text messages between Ratner and a young, autistic actress named Charlotte Kirk revealed that she felt she had been \u201cused as the icing on the cake for your finance deal with Warner Bros.\u201d (Ratner was formerly partnered with Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a $450 million slate financing deal between their RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Warners.)\n\nBut friends of Ratner have told Variety that he saw a pathway back by directing a documentary, which requires little capital and no distributor until much later in the process. Typically, major studios like Amazon don\u2019t get involved in documentaries at the filming stage and instead acquire a finished film when it bows at a major film festival. Ratner had flirted with directing a documentary about two-time Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins.\n\nIt is unclear how Ratner convinced the first lady to trust him with her life story. Ratner directed the Universal thriller \u201cTower Heist,\u201d which used Trump International Hotel & Tower as the film\u2019s primary location. The former and future president visited the set at least once. Ratner is said to have been living part of the time in his native Miami since his career was upended by scandal and travels in the same social circles as the Mar-a-Lago set.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson says: \u201cPrime Video will be sharing more details on the project as filming progresses and release plans are finalized. We are excited to share this truly unique story with our millions of customers around the world.\u201d\n\nAs a producer, Sulichin has worked repeatedly with Sean Penn on films like \u201cFlag Day\u201d and \u201cSuperpower\u201d as well as Oliver Stone on documentaries about Edward Snowden and Luiz In\u00e1cio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva.",

Discussions about how and where she\u2019ll spend her time are ongoing, the sources said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience and much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,\u201d Melania Trump said in an interview with Fox News last year as she promoted her memoir.\n\nThe incoming first lady is expected to spend most of her time over the next four years not at the White House, but between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, sources familiar with her thinking told CNN. However, they insisted she would still be present for major events and would have her own platform and priorities as first lady.\n\nHer preference, sources familiar with her thinking said, is not to be publicly involved, and there is no internal backlash among the president-elect\u2019s team.",

That's 65,000 people in cars, buses, trains, and walking shoes streaming into Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond. How will all those workers affect everybody else's commutes?\n\nThe preceding Friday may have been one of the last mellow mornings at the Pike Place Market. At 9 a.m., some produce sellers had already been there for many hours, but a second shift was starting to roll in. That timing means those workers' commutes coincide with those of Amazon employees returning to the company\u2019s office buildings. On that last sleepy Friday, workers who commute to the market were feeling the calm before the storm. RELATED: Culture-building or cost-cutting? Amazon's return-to-office order raises questions, fears \"It's still a vacation week,\" Tisbury Pringle Ennis said as she set up her art glass display. \"It's kind of hard to gauge because the kids are still out of school.\"\n\n\"It was lighter than usual,\" Daegon Kai said about their morning commute from Capitol Hill. \"There were seven people on the bus.\" Kai said whatever happens next week, their short commute will allow them to weather it.\n\nKUOW Photo/Joshua McNichols\n\nOthers at Pike Place pointed to signs of an uptick in commuter bustle. Nels Weber said he saw more people than usual on his light rail commute. He even saw a fare ambassador for the first time. John Sebastian saw brake lights and bumper-to-bumper cars on I-5 and decided to take surface streets instead, which were wide open. That was the week when Amazon's return-to-office mandate kicked in, on a Thursday. But the week following January 6 could bring more significant changes. Amazon's return-to-office policy will change Seattle's commuter landscape. The question is: When will its full strength will kick in? Also, what will that will feel like now that light rail extends to Lynnwood? Trains coming from the north can cut through congestion like a shovel through a tulip bulb.\n\nKUOW Photo/Joshua McNichols",

            "content": "A warehouse worker at an Amazon facility in Mobile, Alabama, who was struck by a truck and shot in the New Orleans New Year's Day deadly terror attack, was initially denied medical leave by the internet mega-giant, possibly due to an HR mix-up.\n\nAlexis Scott-Windham was celebrating the New Year with friends on Bourbon Street when a pickup truck mounted the sidewalk and rammed a crowd shortly after 3 am local time. She was treated in hospital after the back of her right foot was run over by the vehicle, and she was also shot in the foot. The bullet remains in her limb while doctors work out the best course of action to remove it while she recovers at home.\n\nThe regional Times-Picayune newspaper interviewed Scott-Windham, who revealed she had been denied medical leave by the Amazon warehouse where she works for a medical checkup in two weeks' time. The mother feared if she was absent from work for that appointment, she would lose her job.\n\nOther than that, \"I'm just thankful to be here,\" she said. \"I just want to tell my story to everybody. I don't want to take life for granted. It's really opened my eyes.\"\n\nThe Register asked Amazon to confirm the story, and the tech goliath said Scott-Windham is, contrary to concerns, able to take paid time off to recover from the attack.\n\n\"We\u2019ve reached out to Ms Scott-Windham to offer her our full support, including pay, as she recovers from this senseless act of violence,\" a spokesperson told us. \"We wish her a full recovery and look forward to welcoming her back to work once she's able.\"\n\nIt's believed Scott-Windham requested the wrong type of leave, leading to it being turned down, or so people familiar with the matter have claimed.\n\nIn the attack, 14 people were killed and more than 30 hurt by a terrorist \u2013 identified by federal investigators as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, said to be a US Army veteran from Texas who was once employed by Deloitte \u2013 who drove a rented pickup truck into New Year revelers before leaving the vehicle and opening fire with a long gun. He was also reportedly carrying explosives, and was shot and killed by police at the scene.\n\n\"He was coming so fast, there wasn't any time to move all the way out the way,\" said Scott-Windham. \"I was just blessed that I only got shot in the foot and I made it back home.\" \u00ae",

            "content": "There are no two ways about it. Amazon is one of the modern era's best-performing stocks, up roughly 300,000% since its 1997 public offering. The next 30 years aren't likely to be nearly as rewarding, but thanks to the company's foray into cloud computing, the e-commerce giant is still one of the market's most promising investment prospects at this time.\n\nThere's a better growth stock to consider adding to your portfolio here, however. That's Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER). Here's why.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nWhether Uber is the cause or the result, the trends are promising\n\nAlthough founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp didn't exactly invent the premise of ride-hailing apps, they are fairly credited with bringing the idea into the mainstream. It's still catching on with consumers, too. Uber's third-quarter revenue growth of 20% extends well-established trends. And it's increasingly profitable.\n\nAnalysts expect more top- and bottom-line growth well into the future, too.\n\nThis forward progress is only part of the bullish argument for owning a stake in Uber, however, and not even the most important part. Far more important is the underlying cultural reason for this continued sales and earnings growth. That is, car ownership is on the decline. Ditto for even getting a driver's license.\n\nNumbers from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration reported by legal information website Consumer Shield flesh out the story, indicating that domestic car registrations have dwindled from 2001's peak of 138 million to a multi-decade low of just under 100 million in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout are responsible for at least some of the more recent weakness on this front. But this count has been regularly declining since well before the contagion took hold.\n\nYou may see or hear differing data. Particularly, a commonly cited figure from the Federal Highway Administration suggests that as of 2022 there were actually 283.4 million registered vehicles on U.S. roads. This count includes buses and heavy-duty trucks, however, which are generally owned by governments and corporations for commercial or public-service purposes.\n\nThe number of vehicles sitting in peoples' driveways is also relatively stagnant...at least as a percentage of U.S. households. Consumer Shield adds that as of 2022, the typical American household owns 1.83 automobiles, extending a slight downtrend from 2001's peak of 1.89.\n\nA similar dynamic is evident outside of the U.S. as well, where Uber is expanding.\n\nYoung adults are normalizing a lack of car ownership as they age\n\nIt seems unlikely this shallow downtrend is set to reverse anytime soon. A recent poll performed by car-sharing network Zipcar indicates that more than one out of every three Americans is considering not owning any vehicle by 2030. Nearly one out of every five of these respondents, in fact, says they they're very serious about getting rid of their cars and using alternative forms of transportation instead.\n\nAnd other data underscores this growing disinterest. For instance, Hedges Company predicts the total sales of light vehicles (sedans, SUVs, not commercial trucks) within the United States is on pace to reach a modest 15.9 million units this year despite the decent economy and greater post-COVID stability. That's up from 2023's count of 15.5 million, but still markedly below 2016's peak of 17.4 million.\n\nYounger consumers are growing up with less interest in vehicle ownership than their parents, too...or even getting a driver's license. Numbers from the U.S. Department of Transportation indicate that as of 2022 only about one-fourth of the nation's 16-year-olds held a license, versus half of this age group in 1983. Even the number of 18-year-old drivers has tumbled from 80% back then to only 60% now.\n\nThe chief reasons for this once-unlikely dynamic? Cost is one; the average payment for a new car now stands at over $700 per month. A lack of need is another. Younger generations are completely comfortable with finding entertainment and maintaining a social life via a computer. A ride-hailing service like Uber's makes it possible to live and function in an environment where such a perspective is increasingly the norm.\n\nAnd again, this dynamic is evident in other parts of the world.\n\nBoth stocks are good, but Uber stock is better\n\nNone of this to suggest owning Amazon stock at this point in time is a mistake. It's still a great play. In fact, in many ways Amazon benefits from the same underlying dynamic that's driving Uber's growth. That's the growing number of consumers that are content without owning or even driving a vehicle. These people are similarly content to shop online and let Amazon figure out how to get products to their doorstep. (Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing workhorse is riding a different growth trend.)\n\nOf the two tickers in question, though, Uber is arguably the more promising prospect simply because so many investors still underestimate just how strong its cultural tailwind is and how long it could persist. For perspective, market research outfit Future Market Insight believes the global ride-hailing market is set to grow at an average annualized pace of 15.4% through 2034.\n\nMarket leader Uber is poised to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Uber Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Uber Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Uber Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "We didn\u2019t forget you, you bastards. (Photo: Getty)\n\nWalmart is, and has long been, the biggest private sector employer in America. It has more than two million employees. A couple of decades ago, Walmart was, in the public mind, what Amazon is today: the big, bad symbol of a McJob, the gargantuan employer of last resort that was swallowing up the American workplace. Amazon\u2019s internet roots and its ability to drive the entire retail sector towards online shopping has allowed it to replace Walmart as the dystopian image of The Future of Work. But Amazon still has 600,000 fewer employees. Walmart has never gone away\u2014it just managed to clean up its reputation.\n\nCommon sense tells you that the biggest employer in the country is one of (if not the) most vital targets for organized labor. And for many years, Walmart was. The UFCW, the main grocery industry union, spent a ton of money on what was more of a PR and legislative campaign against Walmart than a straight union organizing campaign, and never managed to win any unions. The company, viciously anti-union since day one, once eliminated its meat-cutting department at 180 stores after meat cutters at a single store in Texas unionized.\n\nToday, Amazon has become the Massive Company We Must Unionize, and for good reason\u2014it probably does more to affect how more Americans will be working in coming years than anyone else. And the Teamsters, fresh off a wave of Christmas strikes, are having some tentative success, though organizing Amazon is a task that, even if it goes well, will be continuing for the rest of my lifetime. But somehow, Walmart feels as if it escaped; from organized labor\u2019s crosshairs, from the harsh glare of public attention, and from its own bad reputation.\n\nBesides allowing Amazon to conveniently take the heat off of it, one way that Walmart pulled off this neat trick was by pouring money into PR efforts to burnish its reputation. (I was working at PRWeek Magazine when the massive PR firm Edelman began its lucrative task of putting a friendly face on Walmart. If you work at Edelman you need to quit your evil job.) Part of this has been a huge effort to put itself at the forefront of corporate America\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d campaign. Another part has been an effort to win the intellectual battle over whether Walmart itself is a net good for the communities where its stores land.\n\nInstinctively, you know what happens when a Walmart opens outside a small town: It becomes the biggest store in town, with the lowest prices, as well as the biggest employer. All the small stores downtown, unable to compete on price, slowly go out of business, a process that only strengthens Walmart\u2019s position as the only place to work. First, use your scale to put your local competitors out of business; then, pay low wages, because where else are your workers going to go? In time, all small town character dissolves in the face of Walmart\u2019s economic obliteration machine.\n\nThe counter to this argument, from Walmart\u2019s allies, has long been that the money that Walmart saves consumers is worth all that other stuff. By being huge and squeezing its suppliers for every last penny and relentlessly cutting prices, they said, Walmart becomes the consumer\u2019s greatest ally. It\u2019s hard to know precisely how to weigh the sides of this argument. Still, all of it has been plausible enough to make Walmart respectable again. Christ, Hillary Clinton was a Walmart board member.\n\nI mention all this because it now is possible to say how the scales balance in terms of Walmart\u2019s effect on public welfare. As Rog\u00e9 Karma lays out in this excellent story in The Atlantic, meticulous new economic research shows that the opening of a Walmart causes incomes to decline in the community where the store opens by more than the amount that shoppers save at Walmart. One research paper says that the average net loss from a Walmart\u2019s opening is about $2,000 per year per person, leading to a 16% increase in poverty locally.\n\nMake Walmart politically toxic again.\n\nAnother paper, by Justin Wiltshire, confirms the mechanism of that damage:\n\nI first show Supercenter entry sharply increased labor market concentration. Supercenters were able to hire large numbers of retail workers with zero increase in average earnings, indicating Walmart had wage-setting power. I then show Supercenter entry caused large declines in overall local employment and earnings, particularly among local goods-producers, indicating Walmart displaced manufacturing demand away from local producers and to its own national and international suppliers.\n\nIn other words, your common sense instincts were correct: Walmart opens a store, puts local stores out of business, which causes the suppliers of local stores to suffer as well, which reduces employment options locally, which forces people to work at Walmart, which then has the power to keep wages low. And Walmart\u2019s low prices do not outweigh the damage from its power to screw workers and small businesses.\n\nFuck you, Walmart. We were right about you fucks all along.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to gently suggest that the fact that there is not a major effort by organized labor to unionize Walmart is, you know, insane. The largest employer in America. Proven to drive down wages and keep communities poor. Owned by the richest fucking family in America, all of whom should be held by the ankles and shaken until their collective $267 billion net worth falls out of their pockets and into the pockets of the millions of workers that they extracted it from.\n\nI do not want to minimize how difficult organizing Walmart would be. Besides the corporate union-busting built into every level of the company, it is always, always hard to successfully unionize large workplaces of low-wage workers with high turnover in areas where people are economically desperate. On the other hand, look at the Starbucks campaign: 500 stores unionized at a large, national low-wage employer. And look at the state of the Amazon organizing campaign: Years of effort with very scattered success have finally come together under the auspices of a major union which appears ready to professionalize the fight and keep banging on the company until they actually secure at least one union contract, which will serve as a launching point for more union contracts. It is still early, but those two campaigns are demonstrations that things can be done in places that have some similar characteristics to Walmart, if enough effort is applied.\n\nDonate to our reporting fund\n\nIn fact, Walmart is probably easier to unionize than Amazon. Where Amazon has warehouses in out-of-the-way locations, Walmart has physical stores, with huge foot traffic. Where do you think a picket line would get more bang for the buck? Walmart\u2019s nature as a physical retail establishment makes it more susceptible to picketing and protests, more susceptible to bad PR, more susceptible to local political and community fights than Amazon. Both are hard. Both are important. But if unions can, ever so slowly, get their roots into Amazon, they can do it at Walmart too.\n\nWalmart is the largest grocery store chain in America. The UFCW has long understood that it is hard to maintain labor power in the grocery industry if the largest player in the whole fucking industry is union-free and can undercut every other company on prices and wages. Although UFCW has a lot of money (which it does not bother to spend on organizing), the truth is that Walmart is too big for any single union to meaningfully tackle on its own. It (along with Amazon, and the big tech companies, and the big union-free national retail chains that trap hundreds of thousands of American workers in permanent poverty) is ripe for the creation of a strategic, national, multi-union organizing campaign. That is the sort of thing that the labor movement would do if it had its shit together, which it does not.\n\nOther than spreading the word about the new economic research, nothing I\u2019m saying here is in any way novel. The lay of the land here is pretty well understood. The new year, though, is a good opportunity for those of us in the labor movement to stop lying to ourselves. Will we have a resurgence of worker power in America if we have zero, nada, no union presence at the biggest fucking employer in the country? No. Come on now. Unionizing Walmart will be hard. Unionizing Walmart will take a long time. The first step is to start. Two million workers will thank you.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nMore",

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via AP Amazon\u2019s total take from third-party sellers was an astronomical $140 billion in 2023.\n\nThird-party sellers are the backbone of the Amazon marketplace, now comprising over 60 percent of all sales on the platform. This actually fits with Amazon\u2019s overall goal, to simply take a cut from every economic transaction. The working theory has been that Amazon, so dominant in online retail, cannot possibly push its sellers so far that it sends them off the platform. But its latest policy change will test this theory, and it\u2019s already receiving significant pushback.\n\nAmazon has for a decade engaged in a slow squeeze of its third-party sellers. In 2014, Amazon was taking a 19 percent cut of seller revenue; by the first half of 2023, this was up to 45 percent, extracted through a variety of commissions, shipping and logistics fees, and increasingly mandatory advertising purchases. Amazon\u2019s total take from third-party sellers was an astronomical $140 billion in 2023.\n\nFees for fulfillment (Amazon\u2019s name for the warehousing and shipping services for third-party clients) also rose in 2024, and added \u201choliday peak\u201d fees for the Christmas season. Now, for 2025, the company has announced it would keep its fees the same, and even lower them in a couple of instances, like for bulky packages. Some industry observers took this as a potentially ominous sign for the economy and a retail downturn. Others wondered if Amazon\u2019s ongoing federal antitrust cases, which involve high third-party seller fees combining with the platform\u2019s lowest-price guarantee to raise prices across the economy, had something to do with the company backing off.\n\nMore from David Dayen\n\nBut Amazon has actually smuggled in what some sellers are calling a de facto fee increase for third-party sellers, under cover of changes to its refund policy.\n\nThe current policy is that when Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) loses or damages a third-party seller\u2019s inventory before a sale, it reimburses the seller at the full retail cost. These losses are somewhat inevitable with so many goods moving around the country; by one estimate, reimbursements constitute between 1 and 3 percent of annual revenue for the average seller.\n\nBut starting March 10, Amazon will only reimburse for a product\u2019s manufacturing cost, which is significantly lower than the sale price. This amounts to a fee for sellers who use FBA: They will not be paid as much back for inventory that Amazon\u2019s service loses or breaks, even though any such losses are clearly not the seller\u2019s fault. And by only getting back the manufacturing cost, sellers will lose any customs duties incurred when importing a product, shipping fees to get the product to an FBA warehouse, or handling fees to prep products for delivery to warehouses. One seller claims that these levies can equal up to 30 percent of the total product cost.\n\nBut the more important question is, how will Amazon calculate a seller\u2019s product manufacturing cost? There are two options, neither of them palatable. Sellers could let Amazon figure out those costs through a \u201ccomprehensive evaluation of comparable products sold by Amazon, by other sellers and through wholesale channel.\u201d That could be a wildly different estimate than the real costs sellers incur for manufacturing, and it opens them up to being harmed by Amazon\u2019s creative accounting. It could mean that when FBA loses or damages a seller\u2019s product, they will actually get paid less than what it cost them to produce it.\n\nBut the second option is arguably worse. Sellers could hand over to Amazon proof of their manufacturing costs, to ensure proper reimbursement. But that would mean giving over proprietary data\u2014manufacturer names, financial information\u2014to a competitor. Amazon\u2019s in-house brands have been accused for years of ripping off sellers on its marketplace by acquiring data on popular products and making knockoffs that undercut them on price.\n\nPrivate label has never been a major part of Amazon\u2019s business, contrary to the good story of Amazon ripping off its competition. But being able to acquire the manufacturing cost data would make it pretty easy to do so. \u201cArmed with knowledge of a competitor\u2019s marginal cost, Amazon could easily drive its rival out of business by pricing one dollar below the marginal cost,\u201d said Hal Singer, an economist and professor at the University of Utah. \u201cEconomists recognize that a firm\u2019s marginal cost is competitively sensitive information.\u201d\n\nThe expectation of weaker regulatory scrutiny in the coming administration could make the moment ripe for Amazon, at least in a targeted way, to start taking out high sellers on its platform. True, Donald Trump\u2019s posture on Big Tech is less clear, but Amazon\u2019s million-dollar donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration is the kind of flattery that could get multinational corporations somewhere.\n\nAnd even if it doesn\u2019t start building knockoffs, acquiring manufacturing information can help Amazon in other ways, like enabling it to go back to suppliers and demand lower costs, as Walmart does consistently. The history of Amazon is that it takes in as much data as possible and uses it for corporate advantage. There are any number of methods to do so here.\n\nSellers are reportedly apoplectic about the refund policy change, and concerned about handing over the nuts and bolts of their businesses to Amazon. Modern Retail quoted several who are fed up with yet another example of the slow strangulation of their businesses. Some have calculated expected reimbursement reductions of between 42 and 70 percent. In a low-margin business like retail, that\u2019s significant, even if losses and damages aren\u2019t a huge part of overall revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to save Amazon billions,\u201d said one seller.\n\nOne seller YouTube video with hundreds of thousands of views claims that the policy change \u201cwill transform the entire Amazon marketplace \u2026 Amazon\u2019s new policy essentially shifts all the blame and financial burden for their warehouse mistakes onto sellers.\u201d\n\nAmazon has not yet responded to a request for comment, but a spokesperson told Modern Retail that Amazon seeks to minimize reimbursement from FBA mistakes, and that the policy change was intended to create \u201ca more consistent approach.\u201d The spokesperson added that seller data would not be shared with anyone.\n\nThe question, as ever, is what alternatives sellers have. They can build their own direct-to-consumer websites. But Amazon is still the point of entry for most online sales; it had been nearly impossible for startups to find an audience. There is starting to be a little more competition among other platforms, from Walmart, Shopify, and TikTok Shop (pending what happens to TikTok in the U.S. this month). But that doesn\u2019t mean sellers can abandon Amazon completely, however, and if the company keeps squeezing them with fees, those margins have to be made up elsewhere.\n\nThis is the basis of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Amazon, which in October survived a motion to dismiss. What Trump\u2019s FTC will do with the case remains to be seen. But it\u2019s rather brazen for Amazon, in the midst of a lawsuit that\u2019s about overcharging sellers and raising prices across the internet, to engage in a policy criticized for overcharging sellers and raising prices across the internet.",

The suit, filed on December 4, accused Amazon of cutting two zip codes in east D.C. from its in-house delivery fleet's service area (20019 and 20020) beginning in June 2022 without informing customers.\n\nBreza, a 20019 resident, provided the graph of the order history he exported, and a change in June '22 is certainly noticeable.\n\nAndrew Breza's Amazon deliveries since 2017 showing which carrier delivered. - Click to enlarge\n\n\"I exported my Amazon order history and plotted how many deliveries were fulfilled by Amazon versus other carriers,\" the data scientist told us. \"You can see exactly when Amazon stopped delivering to 20019 and started outsourcing.\"\n\nIf you're a resident in an area affected by Amazon's delivery exclusion, or have suspicious about something similar going on in your area, you can download your Amazon data here; if you don't want to be overwhelmed by all the info, be sure to only select \"Your Orders\" in the Select Data Category dropdown menu.\n\nThe graph Breza created tells a stark tale: In June 2022, Amazon stopped delivering to his home in 20019. A second graph Breza provided that combines his and a neighbor's orders (both are paying Amazon Prime customers) appears largely the same.\n\nBreza and McMahon's combined Amazon delivery history. This chart only shows deliveries fulfilled by Amazon - Click to enlarge\n\n\"I was surprised to learn how targeted and absolute their policy was - they just removed two zip codes completely rather than it being part of a larger shift in strategy or priorities,\" Breza said. \"I was very surprised to learn this isn't just how they do business in D.C. - that it was just these two zip codes.\"\n\nD.C.'s east end needs Amazon Prime\n\nWashington, D.C. is a city with a long history of racial segregation that, in the district's own words, has \"displaced thousands of black residents and concentrated their communities in the eastern sections of the district,\" those being Wards 7 and 8 on the east side of the Anacostia River.\n\nThe two zip codes that Amazon has excluded from its delivery network that are at issue in the AG's lawsuit are both in Ward 7, a majority non-white district with a lower income and higher unemployment rates than the city average.\n\nThe area has long been underserved by essential retail services: There are no big box stores in 20019 or 20020, and very few grocery stores, either - just three of them serve the two zip codes, and they're at opposite ends of the Ward.\n\nOne of the Safeways that serves Ward 7, represented by Councilman and former D.C. mayor Vincent Gray, isn't thought by some as being a good store. Gray has been critical of his district's lack of good groceries for years, even performing a surprise inspection in 2017 after numerous resident complaints. Not much has improved since then, Breza claimed.\n\n\"There's been a lot of 'supposed to' in the retail history of this area,\" Breza said. The lack of new business development in Ward 7 has left residents relying on Amazon for anything beyond the most basic groceries and household essentials. According to the AG's office, around half of residents in 20019 and 20020 are Prime subscribers.\n\nWhen Amazon, seen as a leader, discriminates against that part of town it sends a signal\n\nThe Register was unable to speak directly with Gray, who is in poor health and whose term ends in January. Gray's long-time spokesperson, Chuck Thies, did chat with us about the difficulties Ward 7 residents have had to deal with due to Amazon's delays, which he says serve to reinforce the choices many businesses have made to not set up shop in the area.\n\n\"When Amazon, seen as a leader, discriminates against that part of town it sends a signal,\" Thies told us. He said there's long been a stigma associated with the east end that's made it hard to attract businesses. Ward 5, on the west side of the Anacostia River, has the same amount of per household disposable income as Ward 7, Thies said, but the east side doesn't get serviced because of stereotypes.\n\n\"We tip our hat to AG,\" Thies said. \"I'm not sure what the genesis of the lawsuit was, but this clearly shows he's paying attention to residents on the east end.\"\n\nGray, who is due to be replaced by Wendell Felder on January 2, has tweeted his support for the lawsuit, describing the practices as discriminatory and a rip-off for paying Prime customers.\n\n\"You can limit deliveries regardless of reason but you can't charge people for a premium service you're not providing,\" Thies told us. \"Councilmember Gray expects Amazon to make every resident who was denied Prime service whole financially in the form of a refund. That is an expectation that he not only has, but sees as non-negotiable.\"\n\nThe safety dance\n\nAmazon doesn't dispute that it has excluded the two zip codes from its delivery fleet's service and offloaded the tasks to other carriers like the US Postal Service and UPS, maintaining in multiple communications with us that the issue pertains to driver safety.\n\n\"In the zip codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages,\" Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly told us. \"We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\"\n\nThies does admit that crime rates in the east end are higher than in other parts of the city, but he contests the idea that Amazon's drivers are in greater peril in Ward 7 than elsewhere - a sentiment echoed by Breza and his neighbor Norine McMahon. Neither dispute the need for Amazon to protect its employees, but they note that's not the whole story.\n\n\"I don't dispute their concerns about safety,\" McMahon told us. \"We're also hearing about those kinds of things happening in other parts of the city - not just here, not just in our part of town.\"\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Amazon's concern for driver safety appears situational. Delivery drivers wearing Amazon uniforms and driving branded vehicles, Amazon has argued in the past, are contractors, not employees.\n\nThose contractors suffer injury rates significantly higher than the industry average and have higher rates of safety violations, thanks in part to the frenetic pace the e-commerce giant forces its contracted delivery workers to move at - which often leaves drivers unable to take adequate breaks and use the bathroom. All the while, Amazon settled an FTC case for pocketing driver tips, and installed driver-facing cameras to monitor its contractors in the name of safety.\n\nResidents in 20019 and 20020 seem to be sick of that excuse. In a series of Nextdoor posts from the neighborhoods included in the AG's lawsuit provided to The Register, many residents reported experiences with delivery delays and uncertainty as to why they were dealing with longer delivery times compared to friends and relatives elsewhere in the district. Many expressed support for the need to keep Amazon drivers safe, but not everyone was convinced.\n\n\"The excuse of 'it's not safe' is really tired,\" said one commenter. \"No place is safe.\"\n\n\"If it's too dangerous for them to send their drivers, fair enough,\" another resident noted. \"But don't offer Prime in those areas then.\"\n\nCustomers just want transparency\n\nAnd there's the rub: Protecting drivers is fine, but residents of D.C.'s east end feel like they're being ripped off.\n\n\"The point that the AG was making [in the lawsuit] was that it's about transparency,\" McMahon told us. \"When I place an order, it'll tell me a delivery date, and as soon as I hit Buy, the completed order shows a day or two later. It changes from the time you add the item to your cart to the time you order it.\"\n\nSimilar stories were reported by other locals.\n\n\"It may say if I order within three hours I'll get it the next day; as soon as I order it they claim I'll get it two days later,\" one local said. Others pointed out that, prior to the lawsuit, they had been curious why deliveries had been slower. Some residents, like McMahon, have even taken to shipping orders to other addresses around town to get them faster.\n\nI am paying for a service that I am not receiving and for that I am upset\n\nOne thread that winds its way through all the dissatisfaction boils down to what one Nextdoor poster said: \"I am paying for a service that I am not receiving and for that I am upset.\"\n\n\"We stand by our customer promise which provides a transparent shopping and checkout process so customers know exactly when they can expect their orders to arrive,\" Kelly said of the customer complaints. \"The fact is, we want to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every zip code across the country.\"\n\nWith Amazon repeatedly telling us it has been transparent, we asked why Prime customers in east D.C. appeared to be largely unaware of the delivery exclusion before the lawsuit, or why so many expressed similar complaints about Amazon suddenly switching delivery estimates after orders were completed. Amazon maintains it hasn't done anything wrong, and that the customer statements shared with it \"require additional information to properly fact check and address.\"\n\nAmazon pointed us to its Prime terms and conditions as evidence it was being clear about delivery benefits and speeds varying between items and locations. Its Prime Delivery Benefits page states that \"nearly all addresses in [the] contiguous U.S.\" are eligible for free two-day delivery. There is no apparent area for customers to check to see if their address is eligible for full Prime benefits.\n\nThe e-commerce giant didn't directly answer questions regarding whether it would consider offering different Prime rates for customers in eastern D.C. or other areas ineligible for Prime delivery benefits.\n\nAll of this makes it seem an awful lot like it's due to a lack of clarity and with no way to verify that certain customers are excluded from Prime delivery benefits, Amazon Prime customers in eastern D.C. are paying for a service they're not getting. Amazon told us it \"disagree[d] with [that] thesis\" and referred us back to its statement and Prime T&Cs it linked us to.\n\nCouncilman Gray's office acknowledged that Amazon does issue caveats that Prime deliveries might not always happen on time, but Thies claimed the online giant's excuse doesn't fly when it comes to excluding 20019 and 20020 because \"they weren't doing their best\" to ensure deliveries were as fast as possible.\n\nThies expects the D.C. AG's case will eventually result in a settlement and some form of corrective action, but that won't come on Gray's watch: Court documents in the matter indicate the initial scheduling conference won't be held until March.\n\nIn the meantime, residents of Washington D.C.'s east end will have to make do with slower deliveries while still paying full price for Prime, with few local options to turn to. \u00ae",

This year, especially, it\u2019s become harder than ever to make money on Amazon, Ames said.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon imposed a slew of new fees that sparked widespread seller outrage and even a Federal Trade Commission probe. Not only is selling on Amazon more expensive now, but the new fees, such as an inbound placement fee, which charges sellers if they don\u2019t split up their inventory to be shipped around the country, have become more complex.\n\n\u201cFrankly, Amazon has become an increasingly complicated and difficult platform to work with, especially as a small business owner,\u201d Ames said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ames is betting on TikTok Shop to turbocharge her business. She joined the platform 14 months ago and began ramping up activity even more after Amazon announced its new fee structure last December. For Ames, TikTok Shop was a natural pivot because she used to be a content creator on the platform. Although the lion\u2019s share of Package Mint\u2019s sales still come from Amazon \u2013 around 90% \u2013 Ames said her sales on TikTok Shop have been growing 20% every month.\n\n\u201cTikTok Shop is much simpler,\u201d Ames said.\n\nAmes isn\u2019t alone.\n\nModern Retail spoke to half a dozen sellers for this story, who said that they\u2019re branching out beyond Amazon. Many cited rising costs and dwindling profits on Amazon as one of the main reasons. At the same time, legitimate competitors \u2014 from Walmart Marketplace and Shopify to TikTok Shop and Temu \u2014 have emerged to challenge Amazon\u2019s dominance. Many boast comparatively lower seller fees to lure more merchants to their platforms.\n\nPut together, Amazon sellers are becoming a lot less loyal to the e-commerce behemoth, and it\u2019s a theme that\u2019s expected to continue in 2025 and beyond.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a single Amazon native seller who is not expanding away from Amazon,\u201d said Jon Elder, CEO and founder at Black Label Advisor, which manages hundreds of brands. \u201cHistorically, it was common to see sellers doing 95% of their revenue on Amazon, but going forward, sellers will average 75%.\u201d\n\nIn a survey of 2,000 Amazon sellers conducted by Jungle Scout at the end of 2023, third-party merchants identified \u201cexpanding to other e-commerce platforms or online channels\u201d as one of their top priorities in 2024. Eva Hart, a senior manager at Jungle Scout, who also sells coffee on Amazon, expects this trend to continue into 2025.\n\nAmazon has tried to maintain its appeal to third-party merchants, who make up 60% of the sales on Amazon\u2019s online marketplace, by announcing that it won\u2019t raise or introduce new fees this year. In a blog post, Amazon acknowledged that the new fees have added complexity to merchants\u2019 businesses, forcing many to change how they operate. But sellers have told Modern Retail that they plan to branch out beyond Amazon anyway.\n\nAmazon fees are 15% or less in most product categories, which helps pay for a variety of services and tools, including fulfillment services that are fast and cost an average of 70% less than other two-day shipping options. \u201cSellers who choose to use these optional services do so because they provide more value than they can get elsewhere, and Amazon\u2019s selling partners are engaging with our store more than ever before and are achieving even greater success,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Mira Dix said in a statement.\n\nIn 2023, more than 10,000 independent sellers surpassed $1 million in sales for the first time, and brand owners grew their sales more than 22% year over year, according to the company.\n\n\u2018They have control over your whole business\u2019\n\nLike Ames, Texas-based Hart grew tired of rising fees on Amazon. But her frustration reached a fever pitch when her brand, Couple\u2019s Coffee, had its account suddenly shut down \u2014 right before Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale in October. Even though Hart had not violated Amazon\u2019s terms of service, it took five weeks to get the account up and running again. During that time, Couple\u2019s Coffee lost between $15,000 and $17,000 in sales. According to Hart, 100% of Couple\u2019s Coffee\u2019s revenues come from Amazon.\n\nHart and her husband originally purchased the Couple\u2019s Coffee brand through a brokerage firm for online businesses. When Amazon added a new field in Seller Central that auto-populated with information from the previous business owner, who was tied to another account that broke Amazon\u2019s terms of service, it created a domino effect that erroneously shut down Hart\u2019s account.\n\nFor Hart, her brand\u2019s account suspension was a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cThat just kind of opened my eyes to the control that Amazon has over your product, and if that\u2019s your only sales channel, they have control over your whole business,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI always knew that it was a good strategy to diversify the channels you offer your products, but it\u2019s kind of easier said than done, and we just had a super honed-in focus on Amazon.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why after Couples Coffee\u2019s Amazon account was live again in November, Hart focused on opening a Shopify storefront. The bulk of sales still come from Amazon, but Hart said her brand\u2019s margins on Shopify are double what they are on Amazon.\n\nOf Elder\u2019s client base, sellers are most heavily investing in TikTok Shop and Walmart Marketplace. The reasons vary. The viral nature of TikTok Shop\u2019s platforms means it can drive traffic numbers that are too powerful to ignore. Meanwhile, Walmart Marketplace has proven to be a natural alternative to Amazon \u201cbecause their system mirrors Amazon\u2019s FBA network with their own version,\u201d according to Elder. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to adapt to compared to TikTok.\u201d\n\nJason Boyce, a veteran Amazon merchant who now runs Avenue7Media, a consulting business for sellers, said there\u2019s been growing interest from sellers in Walmart as a sales channel. He\u2019s in the process of onboarding his entire client base, around 80 sellers, to Walmart Marketplace.\n\nTo be sure, most brands aren\u2019t outright leaving Amazon so much as they\u2019re expanding their reach to other platforms. Despite its high costs, Amazon comes with benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s the obvious added benefits to having your product on Amazon because of that pool of consumers that you wouldn\u2019t have access to,\u201d Hart said.\n\nOther platforms also come with unique challenges of their own. For instance, TikTok could be shut down in the U.S. as early as Jan. 19. Though the platform\u2019s future is uncertain, sellers told Modern Retail they\u2019re choosing to stay.\n\nNew Jersey-based Judah Bergman, the founder and CEO of baby products brand Jool Baby, which has been relying on TikTok Shop more in recent months, said he\u2019s not convinced that the app will go away under the Trump administration because the president-elect has said he does not support the TikTok ban. In the meantime, Bergman said he\u2019s all in on TikTok Shop, where his brand\u2019s sales have grown about 25% since mid-November, and the lower seller fees are too attractive to ignore. Bergman, who has been selling on Amazon for a decade, said small- to mid-sized businesses on Amazon will have to shutter eventually.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the long-term picture for third-party selling on Amazon the way it is,\u201d Bergman said. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has accused Chinese-owned Temu of undercutting domestic merchants by exploiting a trade loophole to bypass tariffs. But that isn\u2019t stopping some American sellers like California-based Craig Leslie, who sells coffee on Amazon, from testing out the platform, which has touted its low fees to bring on more merchants. George Hatch, director of marketplaces at Pattern, an e-commerce accelerator that works with hundreds of global brands, said Pattern is looking to add Temu as a marketplace option for its brands in 2025.\n\n\u201cBrands are absolutely looking at the fees and seeing if they can save money and be more profitable on other channels,\u201d Hatch said.\n\nTo become less reliant on Amazon, Hart plans to sell new versions of her coffee products so she can offer lower prices on Shopify than Amazon. That\u2019s because Amazon is known to penalize merchants who sell their products for less on competing platforms. Looking ahead, Hart said she\u2019ll pull resources away from Amazon to invest more in driving trafficking to her Shopify storefront. That will include devoting a bigger budget to social media advertising.\n\n\u201cAmazon advertising is very turnkey, so coming up with a strategy to drive traffic to an outside platform is more difficult,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, even as sellers like Ames are working to shift their businesses away from Amazon, it\u2019s hard for her to envision a future in which she would ever leave the platform entirely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to imagine completely leaving Amazon,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a seller, there\u2019s only so many options that we have.\u201d",

            "content": "APEX \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Solution to Patent Dispute Resolution\n\nWith the traffic Amazon generates, the e-commerce giant has become an essential, and perhaps even mandatory, marketplace for many companies to sell their products. Yet, companies selling on the platform can face several challenges, including dealing with third-party sellers who provide knockoff and copycat products. Even when a company is selling a product backed with patent protection, third-party sellers providing unlawful knockoff, copycat, or otherwise infringing products can persist and cut into a company\u2019s profits.\n\nPatent protection can be a useful tool for guarding against such unlawful products on Amazon. However, traditional ways of enforcing this protection can be difficult and costly to implement. One traditional way can involve sending a cease-and-desist letter to a third-party seller, and while this letter may ward off some third-parties from selling infringing products, others may dig in their heels and choose to remain on Amazon. A patent holder can escalate by filing a lawsuit, but such an action can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take years before any meaningful resolution is reached.\n\nTo help those seeking a meaningful resolution in a timely and affordable manner, Amazon developed an alternative patent dispute resolution procedure, known as the APEX Procedure. This procedure aims to provide patent owners with a fast and relatively inexpensive way to assert their utility patent rights against infringing products listed on Amazon.\n\nWhat is APEX and Why Choose it as a Patent Holder?\n\nAn APEX proceeding is a patent dispute resolution that concerns products sold on the Amazon marketplace. To initiate a proceeding, a patent holder submits an APEX request with Amazon, which, if approved, will lead to an evaluation that takes place between the patent holder and one or more sellers of the alleged infringing products. The proceeding is overseen by a neutral evaluator selected by Amazon who will decide if the patent holder is likely to prove infringement by the seller\u2019s product.1 If the evaluator finds for the patent holder, the accused product will be removed from the Amazon marketplace. A final decision is typically issued 15 weeks from initiating an APEX proceeding.\n\nAPEX can be an enticing alternative to traditional patent enforcement options, such as litigation. These traditional enforcement options can require years of contested litigation before any meaningful resolution is reached and accrue extensive costs over this time. In contrast, APEX proceedings can be resolved within a few weeks and have greatly reduced costs as a result.\n\nAPEX is also formatted such that any accused seller cannot ignore a proceeding without facing consequences. Once an APEX request is approved by Amazon, Amazon will notify the relevant sellers and provide those sellers with a limited time to respond. Sellers who fail to respond in time, or decline to participate, will have their accused products removed from the marketplace. Thus, sellers cannot ignore an APEX request without facing repercussions.\n\nThe Limitations of APEX\n\nWhile APEX provides significant benefits in time and cost, there are many other considerations to weigh before bringing an action. For instance, APEX does not provide damages to a patent owner for infringement, nor is the accused seller barred from selling their products through other channels \u2013 APEX simply provides removal of the infringing products from Amazon. Additionally, APEX can open the door to federal court patent litigation, as an accused infringer can pause APEX by filing a declaratory judgment action in a Federal District Court of their choosing.2 Thus, APEX may not be the best approach in certain scenarios and should be explored in the context of numerous enforcement procedures available to patent owners.\n\nLooking Beyond APEX and Broader Brand Protection Strategies\n\nAmazon\u2019s introduction of the APEX program speaks to the challenges of brand protection many companies face as a result of increased consumer interaction with brands online. These challenges extend beyond just patent enforcement and can include other complex threats, such as trademark infringement, copyright infringement, brand imitation, counterfeiting, and domain misuse. To help clients navigate these complex threats to their brand, Polsinelli offers its Solare Program, which provides clients with a comprehensive protection strategy that is specifically tailored to your needs. This program can help clients efficiently identify and combat threats across many channels, including in the online space.\n\n[1] APEX provides a more lenient standard of proof for patent infringement than traditional federal court patent litigation. APEX requires that a patent owner prove that infringement is likely, while traditional patent litigation requires that the patent owner prove actual infringement by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., infringement is more likely than not).\n\n[2] SnapRays v.

The answer, I believe, is a resounding yes, fueled by a resurgence in AI-driven AWS growth, a well-diversified business model, generative artificial intelligence opportunities, and robust cash flow expansion.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nWith the 2024 trading year now over, let\u2019s delve into the stock performance and prospects of the world\u2019s leading retailer and multifaceted conglomerate, Amazon.\n\nAmazon Achieved Robust Growth Across Diversified Business Segments in 2024\n\nAmazon has come a long way from its origins as an online retailer, transforming into a multifaceted powerhouse with a uniquely diversified business model. The company boasts a vast and loyal customer base, with millions of users worldwide. In the cloud computing space, Amazon remains the market leader, commanding over 30% of the market despite stiff competition from Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure. Its AWS (Amazon Web Services) segment continues to be the primary driver of profits.\n\nDuring Q3 FY2024, AWS sales grew by an impressive 19.1% year-over-year, reaching $27.5 billion, fueled by surging AI-driven demand. The segment\u2019s operating income soared 48.6% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, with its operating margin expanding significantly to 38.1% from 30.3% in the same period last year.\n\nEven in the e-commerce industry, Amazon continues to dominate, supported by its robust Prime membership base exceeding 200 million subscribers. Despite intensifying competition, the company maintains over 30% market share in the U.S. Notably, its closest competitor, Walmart (WMT), lags far behind, registering a single-digit market share. During Q3, Amazon\u2019s North American retail segment posted a 9% revenue increase and a striking 31% growth in operating income.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Digital Advertising Business Has Also Shown Growth\n\nAmazon\u2019s digital advertising business has also shown remarkable growth. Q3 Advertising revenues rose 19%, driven by strong performance in its sponsored-ad segment. Advertising has contributed over $50 billion in revenue over the past 12 months.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is making significant strides in pharmacy services. The company recently announced plans to expand its Amazon Pharmacy Same-Day Delivery service to nearly half of the U.S. population by 2025. It also aims to roll out new pharmacy locations in 20 additional U.S. cities by the end of next year, underscoring its commitment to scaling this high-potential business segment.\n\nStory Continues",

            "content": "New Year\u2019s Day is all about fresh starts and new beginnings. This time of year presents us with a rare opportunity to approach life with a clean slate, and one of the best ways to celebrate the season is by letting go of old things that no longer serve us and welcoming in new, updated things that can make our lives easier and more enjoyable.

            "content": "There was a historic strike by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters workers at Amazon facilities over the Christmas holiday, yet it didn\u2019t appear to slow Amazon\u2019s deliveries, and actual Amazon employees on picket lines were few.\n\nThat is to say, the strike was more of a publicity stunt by the Teamsters than an actual grassroots revolt by Amazon workers. These holiday season strikes are an old public relations ploy by unions, who are good at creating a narrative and selling it to reporters.\n\nThe unions know that the holidays are a tough period for news outlets. Not a lot is happening, because most people are on vacation. Many of the outlets\u2019 own reporters are angling for time off. A news story that seems serious, like a labor strike, and that comes with all of the details provided by the union\u2019s media team is something news outlets will usually jump on. Following up on the union\u2019s claims can wait until after the holidays . . . by which time the strike is usually over and everyone has moved on.\n\nThe Teamsters announced, just prior to Christmas, the \u201clargest-ever strike against Amazon.\u201d Stories in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and CNN, among others, reported on the walkout. \u201cIf your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon\u2019s insatiable greed,\u201d declared Teamsters general president Sean O\u2019Brien. Having gotten the headlines they wanted, the Teamsters officially called it off on Christmas Eve.\n\nOnly the eagle-eyed would notice that while the word \u201cthousands\u201d appeared in some of the headlines, making it seem like a verified fact, the stories attributed that claim to the teamsters. Who knows how many workers really walked out?\n\n\u201cThere was ONE guy on break protesting at my FC\u201d posted a worker at the subreddit AmazonFC, a worker-created forum. \u201cFC\u201d stands for fulfillment center. A picture on the thread showed a scant four picketers at a site. \u201cLol there\u2019s like 5 people outside of my building and not even outside the gates like down the road,\u201d said another poster on the same thread. Other posts showed pro- and anti-union comments. There was no clear indication of which side was larger.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of nuances here but I want to be clear, the Teamsters don\u2019t represent any Amazon employees despite their claims to the contrary. This entire narrative is a PR play and the Teamsters\u2019 conduct this past year, and this week is illegal,\u201d Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said.\n\nThe Teamsters\u2019 effort primarily involves delivery drivers who work for contractors hired by Amazon. Amazon has refused to negotiate with the Teamsters because it doesn\u2019t consider the drivers to be employees. The Teamsters counter that Amazon is a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of the drivers.\n\nThe Teamsters have previously made some inroads to the online retailer. The Amazon Labor Union, a Teamster affiliate, was certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a federal agency, the winner of an organizing vote at a Staten Island facility in April 2022. But Amazon has contested the result, claiming that the NLRB was biased toward the union.\n\nThe strikes supposedly happened at ten Amazon locations. Amazon has 110 centers across the country. So, the union actions are happening at less than 10 percent of Amazon facilities. Amazon claimed that the incidents didn\u2019t affect package delivery.\n\nThere are telltale details in the stories that illustrate that the events are hype. The NPR story reported:\n\nA major focus for the picketers seemed to focus on drawing more Amazon workers into the union fold. At multiple locations, strikers targeted drivers leaving to deliver packages with chants urging them to sign up to unionize after they complete their route for the day. \u201cSign up after your route,\u201d picketers chanted in New York.\n\nThe New York Times carried a similar report.\n\nIn other words, despite the \u201cstrikes,\u201d Amazon drivers were still showing up and driving off on their assigned routes. That does not fit the definition of a strike, which is workers not showing up at all. It\u2019s likely that the majority of the people at the picket lines were existing Teamsters members who worked for other businesses and showed up to boost the protest.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that they were unable to get enough support from our employees and partners and have brought in outsiders to harass and intimidate our team,\u201d Amazon said in a statement to reporters.\n\nRead more at National Review",

            "content": "E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) trounced the market in 2024, with its share price climbing 45% compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC -1.71%) 24% gains (as of this writing). Meanwhile, Home Depot's (HD -2.37%) shares struggled, gaining just 12.4% for the year amid a slowdown in DIY home improvement spending.\n\nBoth of these consumer goods companies are leaders in their respective markets and, while their current share price gains don't compare, either could be great long-term investments. But which is the better buy right now? Let's take a look.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon is, of course, a dominant e-commerce company that also has its hands in a range of things from cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI). While not all of its endeavors are successful, many avenues Amazon pursues often work out well for the company, making the stock a no-brainer buy for many investors.\n\nConsider that Amazon has 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market, easily outpacing rival Walmart, which has just over 7% market share. This lead translates to massive sales, with North American revenue rising 9% in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30) to $95.5 billion.\n\nAmazon recently launched a new, lower-priced version of its marketplace called Amazon Haul to maintain its lead and fight off increasing competition. The mobile-only e-commerce platform is Amazon's answer to China-based Temu (owned by PDD Holdings) and gives U.S. customers access to items priced under $20.\n\nThat move should help Amazon stay even more competitive in e-commerce, but it's the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that is the true key to its success.\n\nAWS' operating income rose nearly 50% in the third quarter to $10.4 billion, and Amazon likely has many more years of AWS growth ahead of it. The company already holds 31% of the cloud computing market, and spending on cloud data centers is accelerating. Goldman Sachs estimates revenue from the entire cloud computing market will reach $2 trillion by 2030, thanks to a rapid increase in AI spending.\n\nSome investors may overlook Amazon because they believe its best days are behind it, but with the company's continued dominance in e-commerce and its expanding cloud operating income as AI investments accelerate, there's likely more growth ahead for Amazon.\n\nThe case for Home Depot\n\nHome Depot is the leader in DIY home improvement, with more than $40 billion in sales in the third quarter (ended Oct. 27), compared to rival Lowe's $20 billion in revenue. But despite its lead, Home Depot is struggling a bit.\n\nThe company's same-store sales fell 1.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, an indication that customers aren't as eager to walk through its doors and make purchases as they were this time last year. Home Depot management doesn't expect the remainder of the year to be much better, estimating a 2.5% decline in comparable sales for the fiscal year.\n\nThe North American home improvement market was worth $667 billion in 2023 and will reach an estimated $1.2 trillion by 2032. While Home Depot will benefit from this, the current slowdown in customer spending means the company will have to wait a little longer before customers are eager to jump into DIY projects again.\n\n\"We continue to see pressure on larger remodeling projects, driven by the higher interest rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said during the most recent earnings call. Decker is optimistic that demand will return to normal, but added, \"We just don't think we're quite there yet.\"\n\nThe verdict: Amazon is the better buy now\n\nHome Depot's shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.8, compared to Amazon's forward P/E ratio of 35.7. That makes Home Depot's stock less expensive than Amazon's, but I still don't think it's the better buy.\n\nIf the housing market has shown anything over the past few years, it's that no one can reliably predict where it's going. Home Depot's management doesn't seem confident that it's out of the woods just yet with comparable-store sales slowdowns, which means it might be better to put your money toward Amazon's stock for now.\n\nOf course, if you're willing to be patient for home improvement spending to increase again, adding some Home Depot stock amid its recent share price pullback probably isn't a bad idea either.",

            "content": "The Amazon, sometimes called the \u201clungs of the planet,\u201d this year showed signs of further inching toward a much-feared tipping point, threatening the very existence of the world\u2019s largest rainforest.\n\nRampant wildfires and extreme drought ravaged large parts of the Amazon in 2024. The fires and dry conditions were fueled by deforestation and the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, and also made worse by climate change, according to the World Economic Forum. \u201cThe number of fires reached its highest level in 14 years this September,\u201d the group reported in October.\n\nDrought has also impacted the Amazon River, causing one of the river\u2019s main tributaries to drop to its lowest level ever recorded, according to October reporting from The Associated Press. The drop in the river has negatively impacted local economies and food supplies.\n\nAndrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, told the AP last week that the fires and droughts experienced across the Amazon in 2024 \u201ccould be ominous indicators that we are reaching the long-feared ecological tipping point.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumanity\u2019s window of opportunity to reverse this trend is shrinking, but still open,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Amazon plays a vital role in keeping the planet healthy. 150-200 billion tons of carbon are stored in the Amazon, and it also carries 20% of the earth\u2019s fresh water to sea.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, if the Amazon tipping point is reached, \u201cit will release billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere through fires and plants dying off. This would further exacerbate climate change and make the 1.5\u00b0C goal impossible to achieve. It would also alter weather patterns, which would impact agricultural productivity and global food supplies.\u201d\n\nA paper published in the journal Nature in February indicates that up to half of the rainforest could hit a tipping point by the middle of the century. \u201cWe estimate that by 2050, 10% to 47% of Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and potentially exacerbate regional climate change,\u201d explained the researchers behind the paper.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all bad news out of the Amazon in 2024. According to the AP, the amount of deforestation in Brazil and Colombia declined in this year. In Brazil, which houses the largest chunk of the Amazon, forest loss dropped 30.6% compared to the year prior, bringing it to the lowest level of destruction in nearly a decade.\n\nThe improvement is an about-face from a couple of years ago, when the country registered 15-year high of deforestation during the leadership of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil is now led by the left-wing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who \u2014 despite presiding over this drop in deforestation \u2014 has also come under scrutiny, as AP noted, by environmentalist for backing projects that they argue could harm the environment.\n\nWe\u2019re resisting Trump\u2019s authoritarian pressure.

            "content": "Amazon workers at RDU1 warehouse in Garner filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board last week, seeking to become the second unionized Amazon facility in the United States.\n\nThe filing on December 23 followed a three-year organizing campaign by Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or C.A.U.S.E. C.A.U.S.E. ramped up efforts this fall with a push to collect union authorization cards.\n\nAt least 30 percent of current RDU1 workers must have signed cards to trigger a union election. While Amazon keeps RDU1\u2019s headcount under wraps\u2014estimates range from 2,000 to 6,000 workers\u2014organizers say they believe they\u2019ve collected well beyond the number of signatures needed.\n\nThe NLRB will now review Amazon\u2019s employee list against the signed cards to verify whether an election can proceed. The process typically takes several months.\n\n\u201cNothing moves without us,\u201d Mary Hill, an RDU1 worker and cofounder of C.A.U.S.E., said in a December 23 release. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the election. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nIn an email to the INDY, Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards wrote that Amazon is \u201cvery skeptical\u201d that C.A.U.S.E. \u201chas a sufficient number of legitimate signatures to support a petition for election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Hards wrote, \u201cAmazon already offers what many unions are requesting: Safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits\u2014including health care on day one, pre-paid college tuition, and a 401k with company match\u2014opportunities for career growth, and more.\u201d\n\nThe election filing comes amid mounting tensions at RDU1. Earlier this month, Amazon fired CAUSE president Ryan Brown, citing violations of the company\u2019s anti-harassment policy\u2014a move that organizers view as retaliation for union activities. Days later, Garner police arrested three C.A.U.S.E. supporters who were collecting union cards outside the warehouse during a shift change.\n\nThe filing also comes at a moment of heightened labor activity at Amazon facilities nationwide. On December 20, thousands of Amazon delivery drivers launched a six-day strike during peak holiday shipping week, demanding higher pay and better working conditions.\n\nOnly one Amazon facility has successfully unionized\u2014JFK8 in Staten Island. Other warehouses have managed to trigger elections but failed to secure enough votes, struggling against aggressive corporate opposition and challenges posed by Amazon\u2019s notoriously high turnover rates.\n\nThe timeline for the election at RDU1 could face additional uncertainty given the upcoming presidential transition. During Donald Trump\u2019s previous presidency, companies like Amazon had more favorable conditions for challenging union election results. Even after a successful vote, employers can file objections\u2014as Amazon did at JFK8, where it submitted 25 challenges to the union victory, and at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama, where its objections led to a rerun election and ultimately a failed unionization attempt. With Trump\u2019s NLRB potentially more receptive to such challenges, any post-election disputes at RDU1 could face delays or increased scrutiny.\n\nFollow Staff Writer Lena Geller on X or send an email to lgeller@indyweek.com.

            "content": "After struggling through a difficult year in 2022 \u2013 perhaps \"difficult\" is putting it lightly, as its share price was cut in half \u2013 Amazon.com Inc. (ticker: AMZN) stock has been on a vicious rally in the two years since. In the two years ending Dec. 30, 2024, AMZN stock surged a meteoric 163.5%, more than triple the S&P 500's 53.8% return over the same period.\n\nLong-term Amazon investors have come to expect outperformance over the past 20 years. Since 2004, Amazon's market capitalization has skyrocketed from tens of billions of dollars to more than $2.3 trillion, making Amazon one of the most valuable companies in the entire market.\n\nShares of the leading online marketplace and cloud services provider hit fresh all-time highs in 2024, further vindicating patient long-term investors in the company.\n\n\n\nAmazon's 20-Year Journey\n\nAmazon was founded as an online bookstore by Jeff Bezos back in 1994, but the company has made several major pivots throughout its history. The company went public at a valuation of $300 million in 1997.\n\nBy 2003, Amazon had expanded its online marketplace beyond books to music, clothing and other goods sold by third parties.\n\nAmazon launched its Amazon Prime loyalty program in 2005 \u2013 a membership that cost $79 annually and included free two-day shipping on any Amazon order. Prime has been a tremendous success for Amazon over the past 20 years, and there are now more than 200 million global Prime members. Since then, Amazon has been able to ratchet up its membership fees; a Prime membership now costs $139 annually or $14.99 per month.\n\nIn 2006, Amazon rolled out Amazon Unbox, a subscription video streaming and rental service later rebranded as Prime Video.\n\nThe following year, the company launched its Kindle electronic reading device, and in 2008 it acquired leading audiobooks company Audible.\n\nIn 2014, Amazon acquired video game streaming platform Twitch and launched the Amazon Echo smart speaker featuring its Alexa virtual assistant.\n\nAmazon has also expanded beyond the digital world. The company opened its first physical store in 2015 and acquired grocery chain Whole Foods in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, Amazon even started its own annual shopping holiday, Amazon Prime Day.\n\nAmazon has achieved remarkable success over the years despite some misses along the way. The company released its Fire phone in 2014, but it discontinued the project a year later after the Fire flopped.\n\nThe biggest move Amazon made in the past 20 years was the launch of its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business back in 2006. In the nearly two decades since, AWS has been one of Amazon's largest growth drivers. In the third quarter of 2024, AWS alone brought in $27.45 billion in revenue, representing a run rate of about $110 billion annually.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos resigned as Amazon's CEO in July 2021 and was replaced by AWS chief executive Andy Jassy. The new CEO's tenure got off to a rocky start, with the stock tumbling 35.3% during his first 12 months at the helm.\n\nAggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in 2022 triggered a sell-off in tech stocks, and Amazon's 49.4% decline in 2022 was its worst performance of any calendar year in the past two decades. Despite the broad market weakness, Amazon opted to execute a 20-for-1 stock split in 2022, its only stock split in the past 20 years.\n\nREAD 8 Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025\n\nAmazon Performance\n\nAmazon's evolution and innovation have helped the company grow its revenue by almost a hundredfold over the past two decades. Analysts expect full-year 2024 revenue of more than $637 billion, a figure 92 times greater than its 2004 revenue of $6.92 billion.\n\nHowever, its heavy investments in growth initiatives have sometimes weighed on Amazon's profitability along the way, even in recent years. In fact, Amazon reported a $2.7 billion net loss in 2022, which included an unrealized $12.7 billion loss on its 20% stake in electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN). This willingness to delay short-term gratification in the form of sacrificing profits has, however, resulted in incredible long-term performance. By giving up margins early and taking big risks, Amazon has captured a huge market share and hit several home runs.\n\nAmazon's ability to ace the \"marshmallow test\" becomes evident when looking at its long-term returns.\n\nOver the past 20 years through Dec. 30, 2024, Amazon shares have generated a total return of 9,736% compared to a 387% total return for the S&P 500 during that stretch. Those gains translate to a 25.8% compound annual growth rate for Amazon compared to an 8.2% CAGR for the S&P 500 in that time.\n\nAs a result, $10,000 in AMZN stock purchased 20 years ago would now be worth $983,555. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 over the same period, however, would amount to $48,675.\n\nAnalyst Outlook\n\nEven after those extremely impressive long-term returns, many Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Amazon's outlook. Among the 67 analysts covering the stock, Amazon has 63 \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" analyst ratings, and just four \"hold\" or \"sell\" ratings. The average analyst price target for AMZN stock is $240.39, suggesting 8.6% upside from its Dec. 30 closing price over the next 12 months.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram is also bullish on the stock. \"We expect significant profit, margin, and free cash flow growth over the coming years as AMZN expands higher-margin revenue streams,\" Sundaram said in a December research note. He rates the stock a \"buy\" and assigns a $238 price target for shares, representing 7.5% upside from its Dec. 30 closing price.\n\nOf course, after AMZN's rapid price surge in 2024, not all analysts see as much opportunity in shares as they once did. Morningstar's Dan Romanoff, for example, gives the stock a two-star rating and a fair value estimate of $200 per share, representing nearly 10% downside from its current price. As for the underlying business, however, Romanoff is effusive with his praise.\n\n\"From a retail perspective, we expect continued innovation to help drive further share gains in a post-lockdown world. We also look for continued penetration into categories such as groceries and luxury goods that have not previously translated into the same level of success as other retail categories,\" Romanoff said in a note earlier this year.\n\n\"AWS and advertising growth should continue to outpace e-commerce growth and should be the main growth drivers over the next five years,\" Romanoff said.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nIn order to enforce best practices for governance and compliance across AWS accounts in a centralized way, AWS Control Tower is an easy place to start. However, ensuring continuous compliance requires regular drift detection and remediation, which Control Tower facilitates by providing a mechanism to detect drift and publish notifications to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics. AWS Control Tower Drift occurs when configuration changes in your AWS environment deviate from the baseline set by AWS Control Tower. Drift can occur due to manual changes outside of Control Tower, unintended configuration changes, or updates to AWS services and features.\n\nUnmanaged configuration changes, or \u201cdrift\u201d, can undermine the effectiveness of centralized governance frameworks like AWS Control Tower. Avoiding and quickly resolving drift helps ensure that your cloud environment remains compliant with organizational policies and industry regulations, thereby mitigating risks. When drift occurs, it can potentially disrupt Control Tower\u2019s ability to manage your Organizational Units (OUs) and therefore the accounts used to apply controls, monitor compliance, and enforce governance throughout your organization. Being able to quickly analyze and remediate drift enhances your organization\u2019s compliance operations and overall security posture.\n\nUnderstanding the various types of drift, determining their root causes, and remediating the issues add additional operational overhead and consume time that could be dedicated to innovating or modernizing your infrastructure or applications.\n\nIn this blog post we will show you how Amazon Bedrock can be used to streamline the process. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed AI service that can help you analyze and understand the complex data associated with AWS Control Tower drift. For example, Amazon Bedrock can automatically categorize the different types of drift detected, identify the root cause, and even suggest remediation steps. By leveraging Amazon Bedrock\u2019s natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, you can quickly gain insights into your drift data and take appropriate action to maintain compliance without adding significant operational overhead.\n\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll demonstrate how you can use Amazon Bedrock to analyze AWS Control Tower drift and outline the steps for remediation, helping ensure your AWS environment maintains consistent governance.\n\nOverview of solution\n\nThis workflow diagram illustrates an AWS cloud native solution for detecting and responding to configuration drifts. Here\u2019s an explanation of the process:\n\nThe workflow starts in the Management Account, where Control Tower detects a configuration drift. Once detected, the process moves to the account designated for centralized logging (often referred to as the Audit account in a typical Control Tower setup, but this may vary based on your organization\u2019s structure). AWS CloudTrail records the drift event as part of its management events. Data events can be configured in order to capture more detailed information from relevant resources. This CloudTrail event triggers an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic. The SNS Topic then activates and sends an email notification as part of AWS Control Tower. The Knowledge Base feeds information to an Amazon Bedrock Agent.\n\nThe Amazon Bedrock Agent then analyzes the drift information and provides insights into the root cause and potential impact of the detected drift. This setup allows for automated detection, notification, and analysis of configuration drifts in the AWS environment. It leverages various AWS services to create a comprehensive monitoring and response system, helping maintain desired configurations across the cloud infrastructure.\n\nWhile this solution primarily focuses on drift detection and analysis, it lays the groundwork for potential future automation of remediation steps, pending careful consideration and implementation of appropriate safeguards.\n\nUsing Amazon Bedrock Agents to Analyze and Resolve Drift\n\nTo demonstrate Amazon Bedrock\u2019s capabilities, we can intentionally create drift in our AWS Control Tower environment. A common method is modifying a resource outside of AWS Control Tower guardrails.\n\nWhen the drift notification is received, you can leverage Bedrock to gain deeper insights into the issue. Bedrock can analyze the drift notification and provide meaningful information about the root cause of the drift. For example, if the notification references drift due to ACCOUNT_MOVED_BETWEEN_OUS . Amazon Bedrock can explain which Organizational Unit (OU) the account was moved to and from, and explains why the change caused the drift.\n\nKey Benefits of Using Amazon Bedrock for Cloud Governance\n\nProactive Monitoring and Alerts: Amazon Bedrock continuously monitors your AWS environment, providing real-time alerts when drifts are detected, ensuring immediate attention and quick action. To leverage Bedrock for proactive monitoring and alerting of AWS Control Tower drift, you would need to set up Bedrock agents to continuously ingest and analyze the drift notifications from your Control Tower SNS topics. This could be done as a scheduled job or triggered by new drift events.\n\nAmazon Bedrock continuously monitors your AWS environment, providing real-time alerts when drifts are detected, ensuring immediate attention and quick action.

Step by Step Remediation: While Bedrock can analyze the details of the detected drift and provide insights into the root cause, the process of actually remediating the drift would likely still require some manual effort. Bedrock does not currently have the ability to automatically remediate drift issues in AWS Control Tower. However, Bedrock can provide valuable information to streamline the remediation process. By analyzing the drift notification data and correlating it with CloudTrail logs, Bedrock can identify the specific actions or configuration changes that led to the drift. This information can then be used to quickly determine the appropriate remediation steps.\n\nWhile Bedrock can analyze the details of the detected drift and provide insights into the root cause, the process of actually remediating the drift would likely still require some manual effort.

Automated Remediation: Bedrock can help generate code that can be used to automatically remediate certain types of drifts, reducing the need for manual intervention and allowing your team to focus on more strategic tasks.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore getting started, ensure you have:\n\nAn AWS account with AWS Control Tower set up.\n\nAccess to the AWS Control Tower Management account.\n\nAccess to the designated logging account (often referred to as the Audit account in a typical Control Tower setup).\n\nAccess to the AWS Control Tower SNS topic ( aws-controltower-AggregateSecurityNotifications )\n\nwhere drift notifications are published.\n\nPermissions to read and process CloudTrail logs to analyze the root causes of drift. This includes the following IAM permissions:\n\nManagement events Data events for specific resources relevant to Control Tower drift Read access to CloudTrail Lake if implemented Permissions to access and configure Amazon Bedrock, including creating agents and processing data. Access to Anthropic Foundational Models SNS permissions for subscribing to and publishing notifications Amazon CloudWatch permissions for metric data retrieval\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to implement least-privilege access principles, granting only the necessary permissions for the Bedrock agents to perform their required tasks. For a comprehensive list of required permissions and best practices, please refer to the official AWS documentation:\n\nAgent Creation Workflow\n\nTo get started with using Amazon Bedrock to analyze and remediate AWS Control Tower drift, we\u2019ll need to first create custom agents within the Bedrock service. These agents will be configured with specific instructions and capabilities to handle different aspects of the drift analysis and remediation process.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step process for creating the Bedrock agents:\n\nBedrock Agent : Analyze root cause\n\nLog in to the Amazon Bedrock console and select Agents in the left pane navigation. Select Create Agent.\n\nProvide the following details:\n\nAgent name: drift-root-cause-agent\n\ndrift-root-cause-agent Agent description: This agent helps you analyze the root cause of drift and it will give you the steps for remediation.\n\nThis agent helps you analyze the root cause of drift and it will give you the steps for remediation. Create New Role: Add the permissions to the role that were mentioned in the prerequisites.\n\nAdd the permissions to the role that were mentioned in the prerequisites. Select model: Anthropic \u2013 Claude Versions may vary (For the example testing we used the model Claude 3.5 Sonnet ).\n\nAnthropic \u2013 Claude Versions may vary (For the example testing we used the model ). Instructions for the Agent: Identify root cause of Control Tower drift and associated CloudTrail event.\n\nIdentify root cause of Control Tower drift and associated CloudTrail event. Select Save and Exit, then Prepare.\n\nCreating a Knowledge Base\n\nAn Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base is a foundational repository of information and data used by AI models to understand and respond to queries. It serves as the core knowledge from which we draw insights, facts, and contextual understanding to provide accurate and relevant responses to users\u2019 questions and requests.\n\nFor the agent to understand the queries, you should input relevant AWS Control Tower documentation into an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in the audit account. This documentation can be found in the official AWS Control Tower User Guide.\n\nYou can download relevant sections of this guide and upload them to your S3 bucket. Additionally, uploading a sample Control Tower Drift JSON file will allow you to run queries based on the instructions for the agent.\n\nMake sure to follow AWS best practices for securing S3 buckets when storing this information.\n\nTest the Agent\n\nPrompt Engineering refers to the practice of optimizing textual input to a Large Language Model (LLM) to obtain desired responses. Below, you can see the prompts we used for the Bedrock Agent testing.\n\nPrompts:\n\nExample Prompt: \u201cTell me about an event of Control Tower Drift that has occurred in my managed account\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about an event of Control Tower Drift that has occurred in my managed account\u201d Example prompt: \u201cAnalyze drift for Account ID: xxxxxxxxxxxx in Organization ID: o-exampleorgid\u201d Remediation is given.\n\n\u201cAnalyze drift for Account ID: xxxxxxxxxxxx in Organization ID: o-exampleorgid\u201d Example prompt: \u201cCan you elaborate more on the remediation\u201d\n\nThe agent should respond to the prompts and consistently provide steps to remediate the drift to the AWS Control Tower environment as shown in the example above.\n\nOur Amazon Bedrock agent should return:\n\nAccurate identification of the drift event: The agent should correctly recognize and describe the specific Control Tower drift that occurred. Detailed root cause analysis: It should provide a clear explanation of why the drift happened, identifying the actions or changes that led to the deviation from the Control Tower baseline. Potential impact assessment: The agent should outline possible consequences of the drift on your AWS environment\u2019s compliance and security posture. Actionable remediation steps: It should offer specific, step-by-step guidance on how to resolve the drift and bring the environment back into compliance with Control Tower standards. Relevant AWS documentation references: The agent should provide links to official AWS documentation for further information on the drift type and remediation processes.

            "content": "Customers started forming a line at 3:30 a.m. for the grand opening of a long-awaited Amazon Fresh supermarket in Woodland Park, New Jersey. By the time the store debuted about five hours later, an estimated 400 people stood in a queue; the first 100 claiming Amazon gift cards as their reward.\n\nThe 59,000-square-foot store at Plaza 46 that opened in November, the largest in the growing grocery chain, was one of four Amazon Fresh stores debuting in various markets on the same day.\n\nSimilar scenes have been repeated throughout 2024 as the e-commerce giant accelerates the resumption of building out its brick-and-mortar grocery business. After announcing in February 2023 it was shutting some Amazon Fresh supermarkets and halting the chain's launch to retool the concept, Amazon later last year revamped several Fresh locations in suburban Chicago and Los Angeles into its new airier and brighter iteration \u2014 and this year opened more.\n\nAt the same time, it is expanding at Whole Foods Market, the chain it bought seven years ago. Combined, the moves turn up the heat in the already fiercely competitive grocery sector.\n\nAmazon already upended the U.S. grocery business with its Prime online grocery-shopping-and-delivery service, and its most recent moves could have that kind of effect again, according to Coresight Research.\n\nPeople started waiting in line at 3:30 a.m. for the debut of the Amazon Fresh in Woodland Park, New Jersey. (Linda Moss/CoStar)\n\nThe research firm points to the chain's grocery initiatives including experimenting by opening a smaller store, Amazon Grocery, at a Whole Foods location in Chicago; piloting a small-format Whole Foods store, called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, already opened in New York and expected to come to Washington, D.C.; shipping Whole Foods orders from Amazon Fresh fulfillment centers; and conducting a trial in greater Phoenix where customers can shop for grocery items \u2014 including fresh food \u2014 alongside millions of Amazon.com products and have them delivered together, within hours.\n\n\"We expect that Amazon will continue causing market disruption in 2025 as it continues to grow its multichannel grocery model, building on the numerous efforts it has made to bolster its grocery proposition in 2024, including rolling out private-label grocery brands, piloting a new small-format store (Amazon Grocery), and launching revamped Amazon Fresh stores and new grocery delivery subscription services,\" Coresight said in a recent report on the U.S. grocery industry.\n\nSmall player\n\nWith its Fresh stores, Amazon is leveraging the benefit of having what is essentially an existing customer base and loyalty club, its more than 200 million paid Prime members worldwide, according to retail analysts.\n\nDespite its huge scale in the e-commerce world, Amazon is still a very small player in the brick-and-mortar segment of the U.S. grocery field, facing formidable and dominant entrenched competitors with thousands of stores such as Walmart, Dollar Tree, Costco, Kroger and Albertsons Cos. That compares to Amazon's roughly 62 Fresh stores and more than 535 Whole Foods locations across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as roughly 15 small Amazon Go convenience stores.\n\nA rendering depicts a Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, the small-format store that has opened in New York. (Amazon)\n\nAmazon is also up against new grocer entrants to the states such as Lidl and Aldi, savvy regional brands ShopRite and Wegmans, and fast-growing chains Trader Joe's and Sprouts Farmers Market. What's more, Amazon's track record in physical retail has been spotty: In March 2022 the company pulled the plug on 68 stores representing three chains, namely its Amazon 4-star, Amazon Pop Up and Amazon Books locations in the United States and Great Britain. Then came the Amazon Fresh retreat and revamp.\n\nAmazon said it brings a lot to the table in the grocery sector, even as it acknowledges the challenges of its brick-and-mortar forays in that realm.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to build a best-in-class grocery shopping experience \u2014 whether shopping in store or online \u2014 where Amazon is the first choice for selection, value and convenience,\" Amazon spokesman Griffin Buch said in a statement to CoStar News.\n\n\"We already have a large online grocery business and millions of products available for fast delivery, and the next step is to continue building out our physical presence \u2014 which will require significant innovation and persistence,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll continue to open new Whole Foods Market stores, and will do so selectively with Amazon Fresh as we see results we like. We\u2019re encouraged by early signs of our new store design in Chicago and Southern California, and will proceed adaptively.\u201d\n\nAmazon's Dash Cart includes a digital scanner to look up items and a built-in scale. (Amazon)\n\nBuch declined to comment on coming Amazon Fresh stores or their locations. But at least one more, a fifth, is slated for New Jersey at Cedar Knolls Plaza at 235 Ridgedale Ave. in Cedar Knolls, according to local officials.\n\nIn addition to being fiercely competitive, the grocery sector is known for having extremely thin profit margins, but it's huge in terms of sales, hence the allure to Amazon. The industry boasts \"extremely high volume and frequency of purchase,\" according to John Mercer, Coresight's head of global research.\n\n\"Grocery retail is a $1.5 trillion market in the U.S.,\" he said in an email to CoStar News. \"It provides very high frequency of touchpoints with shoppers, which in turn can be a springboard for cross-selling nonfood products and increasingly is the foundation for high-margin retail media businesses.\"\n\nCEO speaks out\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company is pleased with the progress it's making on its grocery strategy while addressing Wall Street analysts during a fourth-quarter earnings call in February. And he focused on brick-and-mortar stores.\n\n\u201cIf you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence,\" Jassy said. \"And that's what we've been trying to do with Fresh over several years. We've been testing [the second version] of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago, in a few locations in Southern California. It's very early, it's just a few months in, but the results thus far are very promising and on almost every dimension. And so we need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating.\"\n\nAmazon\u2019s top grocery executive, Tony Hoggett, left the company in November after nearly three years. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about the work Amazon is doing to improve the grocery shopping experience for customers, and have no doubt the teams will keep the momentum going in my absence,\u201d Hoggett said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nRetail analysts like Mercer agree with Jassy about the importance of brick-and-mortar in the grocery business.\n\n\"At Coresight, we have long argued that Amazon needs a meaningful physical/omnichannel presence to truly carve share in grocery \u2014 an online-only proposition would leave it as a niche player,\" Mercer said.\n\nAt roughly 59,000 square feet, the Amazon Fresh in Woodland Park, New Jersey, is the largest store in the chain. (Linda Moss/CoStar)\n\nThe Woodland Park Amazon Fresh, the revised store format, has wider aisles than the original model and features a lighter color palette. There's a Krispy Kreme coffee shop, a station where pizza is made fresh, and a salad bar. There's a dedicated department offering a selection of crackers, cheese, and charcuterie. Prepared foods, such as ready-to-heat burritos, and ready-made meals, are available.\n\nThe store carries local, regional and national brands, as well as Amazon\u2019s private-label brands Aplenty, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Saver, and 365 by Whole Foods. As another draw, Amazon Fresh recently announced it has expanded its Prime savings program by offering even bigger savings on over 3,000 grocery items for Prime members, including up to 50% off on eight to 15 grocery favorites that rotate each week, including fresh produce, protein, and pantry staples.\n\nThe Woodland Park store also offers some, but not all, of the high-tech features that Amazon Fresh touted with its initial locations. For example, patrons can use the Amazon Dash Cart \u2014 a smart shopping cart that allows shoppers to scan and tally up groceries and even weigh items right in the basket.\n\nThe next-generation Amazon Fresh stores are an improvement over the original version, but several retail analysts questioned if they are really different enough to draw customers from competitors.\n\nMoving the needle\n\nDoug Munson, head of Advisory Services Business Development at RetailStat, told CoStar News that he believes Amazon underestimated how complicated and competitive the U.S. brick-and-mortar grocery sector is. Amazon didn't \"lean into\" and leverage Whole Foods after it acquired the chain, and didn't recruit top supermarket chain veterans to launch Amazon Fresh, according to Munson.\n\nAs for the revamped Amazon Fresh stores design, he said, \"I do question if there was enough that is going to move the needle ... this reset.\"\n\nThe revamped Amazon Fresh format is brighter with wider aisles. (Amazon)\n\nNeil Saunders, a retail analyst and managing director at analytics firm GlobalData, echoed Munson's take on Amazon Fresh.\n\n\"The newly designed stores are somewhat better than older ones, especially in terms of the selection of products,\" Saunders said in an email to CoStar News. \"They also have a good range of convenience foods for busy consumers. While the stores are more compelling, I don\u2019t think they are all that unique \u2014 and this might be one of the reasons that they have difficulty in pulling customers away from their existing supermarkets.\"\n\nTo that point, Munson said he's not sure what Amazon's objective is and who is it targeting with Amazon Fresh.\n\n\"Are you going with after the conventional customer?\" he said. \"Are you going after the Wegmans customer? Are you going after the Aldi customer? I would tell you that I don't think they answered that question. ... Are they going after the ShopRite customer? Because if they are, then they better be in with pricing. They better be in with customer service.\"\n\nAmanda Lai, a director at retail consultant McMillanDoolittle, in a recent report said Amazon is trying to reach a wider group of grocery shoppers.\n\n\"Although Whole Foods leads in fresh-format stores, this remains a smaller segment within the overall U.S. grocery market, which is dominated by traditional grocers like Kroger and mass merchants like Walmart,\" Lai said. \"Amazon aims to tap into this broader market opportunity with its Amazon-branded food stores.\"\n\nCapitalizing on synergies\n\nIn a big change, it appears Amazon is now more aggressively attempting to take advantage of synergies and cooperation between Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods.\n\nThe first Amazon Grocery store has opened in Chicago, adjacent to a Whole Foods Market. (Retail Specialists)\n\n\"While there was little obvious integration between Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods formats for some time, we have recently seen Amazon start shipping Whole Foods orders from Amazon Fresh fulfillment centers with plans to extend this, and a new Amazon Grocery store format co-located with a Whole Foods Market store in Chicago,\" Coresight's Mercer said. \"These suggest a renewed emphasis on bringing its grocery operations together.\"\n\nLai visited and did a detailed report in October on the first Amazon Grocery at 3 W. Chicago Ave. in Chicago. That small-format store \"is located on the ground floor of the One Chicago building ... and uniquely shares a lobby with its upstairs neighbor and grocery sibling Whole Foods,\" Lai said in her report.\n\nWith an Amazon Grocery and Whole Foods at the same location, Amazon is looking to serve customers who shop at both conventional and natural and organic supermarkets, according to Lai.\n\n\"Customers might buy packaged goods at Amazon Grocery, then head upstairs to Whole Foods for high-quality meat and organic produce,\" she said.\n\nAmazon could expand its 3,800-square-foot Amazon Grocery concept \"to other urban markets where it would be challenging to open and operate standard 40,000-plus-sure-foot full-sized supermarkets,\" Lai said. \"Weeks earlier, Whole Foods opened its first small format Daily Shop concept in New York, another market well-suited for smaller-sized stores.\"\n\nHowever, she did question whether shoppers will be befuddled by Amazon's various brick-and-mortar grocery offerings.\n\n\"The new concept [Amazon Grocery] adds complexity to a growing portfolio of store brands that could lead to consumer confusion,\" Lai said. \"Amazon\u2019s grocery portfolio now includes Whole Foods Market, Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, Amazon Fresh, Amazon Go, and the new Amazon Grocery.\"\n\nBeyond online disruption\n\nAmazon disrupted the grocery segment with its online delivery service, forcing rival supermarket chains to offer or improve their e-commerce channels, according to Munson.\n\nRoughly three years ago, Kroger partnered with Ocado Group \u2014 a tech firm based in the United Kingdom \u2014 to open fulfillment centers in markets where it didn't have stores, so it could offer online grocery delivery in those areas. Munson correlates that move by Kroger to its recognition Amazon's \"huge online presence\" and its deep dive into grocery by acquiring Whole Foods.\n\nThere's a lot of opportunity now for a deep-pocketed company like Amazon, even though it has a small physical footprint now, to establish a bigger presence in the highly fragmented grocery industry, which is ripe for consolidation, according to Mercer.\n\nIn December, Albertsons backed out of a $24.6 billion proposed merger with Kroger \u2014 the largest deal of its kind in U.S. history, a day after a federal judge scuttled the plan.\n\n\"Longer term, we see opportunities for Amazon to capture greater share with a combination of a strong cross-channel proposition, high-quality private labels and price competitiveness,\" Mercer said.\n\nHe added that they expect Amazon to be one of a number of retailers, including discounters such as Aldi, \"that challenge the traditional supermarket segment.\"",

Amazon's return-to-office order raises questions, fears\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph has relocated to another state twice in the two years he\u2019s worked for Amazon. He asked that we only use his middle name, fearing professional repercussions for criticizing his employer publicly. Amazon has been asking employees like him to move to \u201chub cities\u201d so that they can start coming into the office every day under a so-called \"return to office\" policy that takes effect Thursday. RELATED: Amazon announces 5-day return-to-office plan for most employees The change makes Amazon the largest private employer to roll back its pandemic-era work-from-home policy. It\u2019s been five years since Covid upended white collar work. The majority of workers who can work from home still do, at least some of the time.\n\nJuan Pablo Chiquiza\n\nAs Amazon becomes one of the most high-profile companies to buck that trend, experts are watching to see if it will become a bellwether. On the first day of the new policy outside Amazon's iconic Spheres in downtown Seattle, some workers were optimistic about the change. Marc Lobree, who manages relationships between Amazon and other tech companies, said returning to the office felt like his \"civic duty\" to help revive Seattle's downtown. \"Through Covid we all retracted in our own little spaces, which makes sense,\" Lobree said. \"But we're in a thriving economy that requires an exchange of economic goods and transactions between all of us in order to keep the fire going.\" That enthusiasm was echoed by downtown businesses that rely on Amazon workers to stay afloat. But not all Amazon employees were thrilled with the return-to-office requirement. RELATED: Hear a longer version of this conversation on KUOW's economy podcast, Booming:\n\nIn an email reviewed by KUOW, Amazon gave Joseph an ultimatum. If he couldn\u2019t move to Seattle, his last day would be Nov. 22. He decided to move. On a sunny December day, Joseph sat down at the dining room table of his new Seattle-area home, surrounded by boxes, to talk about how Amazon\u2019s return-to-office policy has affected him. He said that being asked to work from the office full time is a greater burden than being asked to move to a new time zone. Joseph says his ADHD and autism make it difficult to be in an open-concept office every day. \u201cI have developed coping mechanisms over the years, so it's not like I can't deal with social interaction, but five days a week, every week a year, for the rest of your life, that's where it starts to be a problem,\u201d he said. RELATED: Could a return of workers to downtown offices rescue Seattle\u2019s ailing budget?\n\nJuan Pablo Chiquiza\n\nAmazon declined an interview request for this story, but shared a statement via email. \u201cWe understand that this is going to be a transition and we\u2019re working with our employees to make it as easy as possible,\u201d said Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan. \u201cWe continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. When in-person accommodations are needed, we\u2019ll provide them, and in some cases, offer an exception to working from the office.\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced the five-day in-office policy in September, 10 paragraphs into a memo about flattening the organization and reducing middle managers. \u201cWe\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another,\u201d Jassy said in the public letter to employees. As an early career data scientist at Amazon, Sam Rainier sees the value of more in-person mentorship.\n\n\u201cWhen I started all-remote there were a couple people on the team that were senior level, they had founded the team, and they're obviously these go to people for information,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I still felt like it was very daunting to poke my head in their office virtually and say, \u2018Hey, do you have some time?\u2019\u201d Rainier thinks being in the office more could solve that problem for some employees, but not for him. \u201cThat person is still virtual for me,\u201d he said. His team is distributed across Amazon hubs, so meetings are still happening online. Still Rainier says he\u2019s willing to comply with the policy. RELATED: Amazon faces multiple strikes as union targets holiday shopping rush\n\nJuan Pablo Chiquiza\n\nNot everyone feels the same.\n\nKUOW talked to 10 Amazon employees for this story and nearly all of them were critical of the return-to-office policy. Some, like Joseph, worry their disabilities will not be sufficiently accommodated. Others rely on flexibility to care for young children and aging parents. Many said Amazon has not provided sufficient data or evidence that the policy is good for business. And several said they\u2019ve already started looking for a new job. Some experts think that attrition is a feature of the policy, not a bug. \u201cAmazon hired very aggressively in 2021-22 with the rebound from the pandemic and suddenly discovered they just had too many employees,\u201d said Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies the workplace. \"And so, option one is to fire a bunch of folks, but you have to pay them severance pay. It's expensive. People get very angry. So option two, I think their view was, \u2018Why don't we call everyone back to the office for five days a week?' Probably about 10% of people won't like it. They live too far away. They'll quit on us and that will save us a lot of money.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "Jeff Bezos is getting exponentially richer, while the employees who create his wealth are reporting debilitating injuries and extremely high rates of musculoskeletal disorders. This juxtaposition has led to rising anger on the part of Amazon workers, thousands of whom struck the company at the peak of the holiday season, in order to focus attention on the corporations profiteering at the expense of its workers. Those strikes, from Staten Island to San Francisco, drew a good deal of attention to demands by the Teamsters and its affiliated Amazon Labor Union for higher wages and increased benefits. But the workers also want consumers to know that conditions inside Amazon warehouses are an extremely serious issue. Indeed, an April 2023 study revealed that while Amazon employs roughly one-third of all warehouse employees in the United States, it accounts for more than half of all warehouse injuries. \u201cFor how much we do for this company, we deserve higher pay, better benefits, and safer work conditions,\u201d said Tobias Cheng, one of the workers who struck the corporation\u2019s sprawling KSBD air hub in San Bernardino, California.\n\nBezos, whose skyrocketing wealth is approaching a quarter trillion dollars, is a notoriously anti-union employer. So it comes as no great surprise that his company, which now has more than 700,000 workers, has tried to foster the fantasy that the strikes\u2014and the concerns of Amazon\u2019s workers\u2014are of no consequence. But the Bezos team did not hide the fact that they were unsettled when Senator Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, spoke bluntly about the corporation\u2019s disregard for worker safety.\n\nJust before Christmas, the committee released \u201cThe \u2018Injury-Productivity Trade-Off\u2019: How Amazon\u2019s Obsession with Speed Creates Uniquely Dangerous Warehouses,\u201d a study based on more than 18 months of research by Sanders and HELP committee staff into working conditions inside Amazon warehouses. The conclusions, as Sanders noted, were devastating. \u201cThe shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon\u2019s warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cMaking matters even worse: Amazon\u2019s executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries at its warehouses. This is precisely the type of outrageous corporate greed that the American people are sick and tired of.\u201d\n\nAmazon did not take kindly to that observation. Within hours of the release of the report, Amazon released a 2,400-word denunciation of the HELP committee\u2019s study, which declared that the report is \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d and asserted that \u201cit\u2019s now clear that this investigation wasn\u2019t a fact-finding mission, but rather an attempt to collect information and twist it to support a false narrative.\u201d In classic \u201cprotest too much, methinks\u201d fashion, the Amazon statement featured repeated assertions along the lines of: \u201cAt Amazon, our employees\u2019 safety is and always will be our top priority\u2014nothing is more important to us.\u201d\n\nCurrent Issue View our current issue Subscribe today and Save up to $129. Subscribe\n\nThose claims were hard to square with the history of complaints about Bezos prioritizing profits and defending corporate greed, and with accusations that Amazon has engaged in systematic price gouging.\n\nFar more compelling are the detailed findings of committee\u2019s report on the \u201cInjury-Productivity Trade-Off,\u201d an analysis of which explains:\n\nAs part of the investigation, the Committee analyzed Amazon\u2019s data and found that Amazon warehouses recorded over 30 percent more injuries than the warehousing industry average in 2023. The Committee also found that in each of the past seven years, Amazon workers were nearly twice as likely to be injured as workers in other warehouses. Alarmingly, this problem is widespread: More than two-thirds of Amazon\u2019s warehouses have injury rates that exceed the industry average.\n\nThe key findings of the report from Sanders and the HELP Committee offer an indictment of Amazon\u2019s practices, especially the conclusions that\n\nAmazon manipulates its workplace injury data to make its warehouses seem safer than they actually are. Contrary to its public claims, Amazon imposes speed and productivity requirements on workers, commonly called \u201crates.\u201d Amazon forces workers to move in unsafe ways and to repeat the same movements hundreds and thousands of times each shift, resulting in extremely high rates of musculoskeletal disorders. Although Amazon has safety procedures in place, the company\u2019s speed requirements make those procedures nearly impossible to follow. Amazon\u2019s failure to ensure safe working environments\u2014based in large part on its unsustainable rates and productivity quotas\u2014results in debilitating injuries. Amazon has studied the connection between speed requirements and worker injuries for years, but refuses to implement injury-reducing changes because of concerns those changes might reduce productivity. Amazon actively discourages injured workers from receiving outside medical care, putting injured workers further at risk. Workers who need short-term or permanent workplace accommodations for work-related injuries and disabilities experience significant challenges obtaining appropriate accommodations. Amazon terminates workers injured in the company\u2019s warehouses who are on approved medical leave. Amazon deflates the injury numbers it records for federal regulators.\n\n\u201cAmazon forces workers to operate in a system that demands impossible rates and treats them as disposable when they are injured,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cIt accepts worker injuries and their long-term pain and disabilities as the cost of doing business. That cannot continue. Amazon is a $2.3 trillion corporation. It made over $36 billion in profits last year alone. Its founder, Jeff Bezos, is the second wealthiest person on the planet worth over $240 billion. Its CEO, Andy Jassey, made over $300 million in total compensation since 2021. Amazon should be one of the safest places to work, not one of the most dangerous. Amazon cannot continue to treat its workers as disposable. It must be held accountable.\u201d",

            "content": "Can Amazon still deliver market-beating returns after soaring near all-time highs at the end of 2024?\n\nE-commerce pioneer Amazon (AMZN -2.83%) belongs in the small handful of stocks I'd consider buying at any time. At the same time, master investors like Warren Buffett insist that even great companies should be bought only at reasonable prices.\n\nAs 2024 winds down, Amazon shares have gained more than 46% this year. The stock trades just 6% below its all-time high, which was set two weeks ago. Is Amazon still a buy at these soaring share prices, or should you let the stock cool down before taking another look in 2025?\n\nIs Amazon stock overpriced?\n\nStop me if you've heard this before: Amazon's stock looks expensive.\n\nThe online retailer and cloud computing innovator has indeed reached a lofty perch on Wall Street. It's one of the vaunted \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, with a $2.27 trillion market cap. Shares are changing hands at 47 times earnings (P/E) and 53 times free cash flow (P/FCF). There's just no other way to look at it -- Amazon's stock isn't cheap right now.\n\nThis market-beating stock never looks cheap\n\nThen again, this stock never seems like a bargain. It doesn't really matter what metrics you apply to the chart -- Amazon shares feel expensive most of the time.\n\nThe chunky price-to-earnings ratio is about the lowest it's been in the last 15 years:\n\nThe cash flow ratio is also low from a historical perspective. In this view, Amazon stock felt affordable after the subprime meltdown of 2008-2009 and again as the cloud computing segment turned profitable in the mid-2010s, but Amazon also depleted its cash profits in 2013 and 2021. Data center equipment, world-class shipping services, and upgraded headquarters can be expensive.\n\nIn the end, Amazon's average P/FCF over the last decade and a half stands at 108:\n\nAnd I really don't have to remind you that the stock delivered exceptional returns anyway, right? The S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.71%) rose 424% in the 15-year period I've highlighted, but Amazon raced ahead with a 3,070% gain:\n\n\"Perfect timing\" is a real thing. Nobody knows how to achieve it.\n\nI agree that it makes a difference when you nail the perfect time to buy any particular stock. If you grabbed Amazon shares on the right day in June 2009 instead of six months later, you'd have a 5,550% return in your pocket instead. That's a much better result.\n\nBut nobody knows how to pinpoint those perfect buy-in dates. Warren Buffett is the first to admit that he can't see \"what the stock market is going to do in the next six months, or the next year, or the next two.\"\n\nThat uncertainty applies to the market as a whole and to each individual stock. The best any investor can do is pick up shares of great companies when it seems to make sense, then let the underlying business deliver profitable growth and shareholder returns in the long run. That's good enough for billionaires like Buffett, and more than fine for me. You should consider a similar approach, too.\n\nYes, you can buy Amazon today\n\nMaybe this isn't the best time ever to buy Amazon stock. But it's also not a bad time.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon should benefit from a stronger economy, the continued artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and its recently launched drone delivery system. I'm talking about a world-class innovator with a flexible business plan, and the stock may never seem affordable but still provides winning returns over the years.\n\nSo you shouldn't back up the truck, bet the farm, or put your whole nest egg into Amazon stock today. However, you might want to start a modest Amazon position if you haven't yet, using price-mitigating techniques such as buying in thirds or running an automated dollar-cost averaging plan.\n\nThe road ahead may be bumpy, but you don't want to watch from the sidelines as Amazon keeps treating its shareholders to market-beating returns in the long haul.",

            "content": "By Dar\u00edo Ram\u00edrez and Carlos Mazabanda\n\nOn the 4th October 2024, Amazon Frontlines published a detailed analysis titled: \u201cAmazon Fires Devastate Indigenous Territories and Protected Areas: A Crisis in Numbers\u201d, documenting the immediate devastation caused by forest fires in Indigenous territories and protected areas.\n\nIn our first report, we presented data demonstrating the alarming scope of the fires and their immediate impacts. Now, in this second report, we are expanding our analysis, exploring the long-term repercussions that these fires will have on Amazonian ecosystems and on the communities that depend on them.\n\nThe link between the destruction of forests and the drastic alteration of ecological cycles \u2014 such as evapotranspiration \u2014 is becoming increasingly evident, threatening to bring the Amazon to a point of no return unless urgent and comprehensive action is taken.\n\nOur new research focuses on the drivers of these massive fires, as well as on the emerging environmental trends that threaten to push the Amazon to the brink. Using the latest data, we examine how agricultural expansion, climate change and extractive practices continue to fuel a destructive cycle that is both transforming the Amazon, and accelerating the global climate crisis.\n\n2024 witnessed some of the highest rates of forest fires in the Amazon from the past two decades. According to the National Institute for Space Research (Brazil), 346,112 fire hotspots were recorded between January and September, surpassing the historic record of 2007.\n\nThe Industries Fueling the Amazon fires\n\nThe majority of fires in the Amazon are not caused by natural events but are instead human-driven. The expansion of agribusiness\u2014particularly soybean cultivation and beef production\u2014is a leading driver of deforestation, which is interconnected with the increase of forest fires.\n\nAgribusiness projects in the Amazon often rely on fire to clear land, cutting down forests and burning vast areas once the vegetation has dried. This method significantly heightens the risk of uncontrolled fires spreading, endangering ecosystems and communities alike.\n\nScientific studies have demonstrated that the loss of trees alters the evapotranspiration cycle, reducing cloud formation and affecting the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to produce rain. Drier conditions increase the frequency of fires, and make them harder to control.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have warned of a rapidly approaching \u201ctipping point\u201d in the Amazon. Some scientists suggest that this may occur once over 20-25% of the forest has been destroyed, the natural cycle of evapotranspiration is radically altered, preventing the healthy maintenance of the ecosystem.\n\nClimate change has also intensified the problem. Higher temperatures and prolonged droughts, exacerbated by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, create drier conditions in the rainforest, facilitating the spread of fires. Much of the Amazon\u2019s vegetation is becoming increasingly flammable, allowing fires that once remained confined to deforested areas to spread into ancient, untouched forests\u2014ecosystems that were never meant to burn.\n\nThese dynamics create self-reinforcing cycles of fire and warming. Deforestation accelerates climate change, which then fosters conditions more favorable for forest fires. These fires, in turn, drive further deforestation, perpetuating the destructive cycle.\n\nOne of the most alarming trends is that, despite efforts by some Amazonian governments to curb deforestation, fires continue to surge. In 2023, Brazil managed to halve its deforestation rate, yet the area consumed by forest fires increased by 36%. This highlights that deforestation and fires do not always align. The unchecked spread of fires, coupled with weak environmental protection policies, has triggered a crisis that threatens the integrity and biodiversity of the Amazon region, while posing significant risks to global climate stability.\n\nFire Hotspots and their Impacts on Indigenous Lands and Protected Areas\n\nThe global impact of Amazonian fires is profound. The carbon released from burning trees and vegetation directly contributes to global warming. Estimates indicate that in 2024 alone, forest fires have already released millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change and creating conditions that further increase fire risk.\n\nAs global temperatures rise, forest fires in the Amazon grow increasingly frequent and destructive. This self-perpetuating cycle, fueled by deforestation, climate change, and unsustainable agricultural practices, poses a serious threat to the Amazonian ecosystem and has far-reaching consequences worldwide. The most affected are the Indigenous communities who face daily challenges in protecting and sustaining the vital ecosystem that is their home.\n\nAt Amazon Frontlines, our team has been analyzing the increase in fire hotspots, with a particular focus on their impact on Indigenous territories and Protected Areas. We rely on data from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), an interactive platform that monitors fires by compiling near real-time data from various NASA satellites. It\u2019s important to note that our analyses utilize only the fire hotspot information with \u201chigh\u201d confidence values, which are linked to recurring thermal anomalies during both day and night.\n\nA dramatic increase in fire hotspots from 2023 to 2024\n\nFor our analysis, we selected August 1st as the starting date, when 600 fire hotspots were recorded\u2014the highest number at that time\u2014and October 8th as the closing date, which showed a declining trend with 426 fire hotspots. Between August 1st and October 8th, 2024, a total of 34,896 fire hotspots were recorded.\n\nIn comparison, during the entire year of 2023\u2014from January 1st to December 31st\u2014there were 72,631 fire hotspots recorded. This means that 48% of all fire hotspots detected in 2023 occurred within just 68 days of 2024.\n\nDuring the period analyzed in 2023, 34,986 fire hotspots were recorded in the Amazon region. Of these, 92% were in Brazil and Bolivia, with 72% in Brazil and 20% in Bolivia. Additionally, 4% of the total fire hotspots occurred within Protected Areas, while 14% were found in Indigenous Territories.\n\nAugust 1 thru October 8, 2023 Fire Hotspots % Of the Total In Protected Areas % Of the Country\u2019s Total In Indigenous Territories % Of the Country\u2019s Total Brazil 25,166 72% 1,333 5% 2,984 12% Bolivia 7,095 20% 134 2% 1,484 21% Peru 2,200 6% 29 1% 368 17% Remainder of Countries 525 2% 53 10% 169 32% TOTAL 34,986 100% 1,549 4% 5,005 14% August 1 thru October 8, 2024 Fire Hotspots % Of the Total In Protected Areas % Of the Country\u2019s Total In Indigenous Territories % Of the Country\u2019s Total Brazil 71,610 72% 3,344 5% 12,677 18% Bolivia 24,225 24% 939 4% 9.035 37% Peru 3,332 3% 52 2% 537 16% Remainder of Countries 182 0% 21 12% 44 24% TOTAL 99,349 100% 4,356 4% 22,293 22%\n\nIn 2024, during the analyzed period, 99,349 fire hotspots were detected in the Amazon region. Of these, 96% occurred in Brazil and Bolivia, with 72% in Brazil and 24% in Bolivia. Of the total fire hotspots recorded, 4% were in Protected Areas, while 22% were in Indigenous Territories.\n\nIn order to visualize this information, we have developed this dashboard presenting the evolution of fire trends on an interactive map, as well as data on how fires affected protected areas and Indigenous territories.\n\nIn the Amazon Region\n\nFire hotspots increased by 184%\n\nFire hotspots in Protected Areas increased by 181%\n\nFire hotspots in Indigenous Territories increased by 345%\n\nIn Bolivia\n\nFire hotspots increased by 241%\n\nFire hotspots in Protected Areas increased by 601%\n\nFire hotspots in Indigenous Territories increased by 509%\n\nIn Brazil\n\nFire hotspots increased by 185%\n\nFire hotspots in Protected Areas increased by 151%\n\nFire hotspots in Indigenous Territories increased by 325%\n\nIn Peru\n\nFire hotspots increased by 51%\n\nFire hotspots in Protected Areas increased by 79%\n\nFire hotspots in Indigenous Territories increased by 46%\n\nClimate Change and Global Consequences\n\nThe Amazonian region is known as the lungs of our planet, given the region\u2019s crucial role in carbon capture and global climate regulation. Nonetheless, fires are transforming the vast region into a source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Brazil and Bolivia are estimated to have respectively emitted 180 and 30 megatons of CO2, respectively\u2014levels that surpass the annual emissions of Norway. These emissions are not only accelerating climate change but also fueling a dangerous cycle that increases the risk of future fires.\n\nForest fires are also destroying the habitats of thousands of critical species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Fires in 2024 ravaged 22.38 million hectares, marking a 150% increase compared to the same period in 2023. This loss of biodiversity is irreversible and jeopardizes the ecological balance of not only the Amazonian region, but the entire planet. We are confronted with a troubling reality: one of the world\u2019s vital ecosystems for regulating climate is now exacerbating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions through fires.\n\nTo halt forest fires and protect the Amazon region, it is crucial to tackle the root of the problem: deforestation. Agricultural expansion and illegal mining are degrading ecosystems, leaving forests more vulnerable to fires, and destroying the river systems vital for both biodiversity and Indigenous communities.\n\nIt is urgent to implement policies that halt deforestation and promote the restoration of degraded areas. Protecting rivers and water resources\u2014critical for the ecological balance of the Amazon\u2014must be made a priority. Indigenous communities, who have long been the most effective stewards of the rainforest, must be strengthened and supported to continue their work in cultural and ecological conservation. This is a fight that affects us all, as the struggle for the Amazon is, ultimately, a fight for the climate safety we all share.\n\n",

He explained that he just came from a hybrid model.\n\n\u201cI guess I would\u2019ve liked the option of working home on the days I wanted to, but the office space is really good and I do feel like I\u2019m productive here to,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal business owners surrounding Amazon office locations can certainly understand that when the pandemic took away customers. They are now happy to welcome potential customers back, more days a week.\n\nALSO SEE |\n\nEven though Amazonians lined up at local food trucks for lunch on a Monday, local businesses are not making anything near their pre-pandemic numbers.\n\n\u201cWe were working here in South Lake Union and selling out between the hours of 11 AM and 2 PM every day bringing in about $2500-$3000 business,\u201d Christopher McClendon, told KOMO, while working in the Pararepas food truck, parking on Republican Street, outside several Amazon office buildings.\n\nMcClendon told KOMO that those daily sales totals immediately fell to $350 forcing some major changes.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic hit we went from two food trucks, 12 employees and we had to go back to four employees operating both food trucks doing all the shopping and everything, so quite a bit of a cut back,\u201d McClendon explained.\n\nBusiness picked up a bit, once Amazon required workers to spend at least three days in the office.\n\n\u201cSo, we definitely look forward to them coming back five days a week. I understand that\u2019s not going to be convenient for everybody but as far as our industry goes, it is going to be a big boost,\u201d said McClendon.\n\nThe Downtown Seattle Association told KOMO News this new policy from Amazon, which is downtown\u2019s largest employer, is a home run.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s decision reinforces the value of in-person work to the success of companies and organizations. When Amazon moved to three days per week in May \u201823 the impact was huge, particularly in the Denny Regrade and South Lake Union neighborhoods,\u201d DSA President and CEO Jon Scholes told KOMO News in a written statement.\n\n\u201cOther employers may take notice and make similar moves, and downtown is ready for their return,\u201d Scholes added.\n\nJust as the saying goes, the more the merrier. The Amazon workers spending five days a week in the office will \u201cadd to the overall vibrancy of the heart of the city.\u201d\n\nBut this will also increase traffic congestion for tens of thousands of drivers using the same roads and interstates as Amazon employees. Those who choose to take transit can expect those buses and trains to be a lot more crowded.\n\nRyan Avery, the deputy director of the Washington State Transportation Center at the University of Washington said it may not be too bad the first few days, or even weeks, since those office workers will be working on establishing their new habits.\n\nAvery said traffic in the Seattle metropolitan area has mostly returned to pre-pandemic levels, with people making other trips, not just to and from an office. That, he said has also spread the peak commute times over more hours in the day.\n\nThose office workers will likely be into their new transportation patterns, just as the state launches into its . There will be a 30% reduction in traffic capacity along with full ramp closures when the Washington Department of Transportation starts the project.\n\nALSO SEE |\n\n\u201cThere's going to be more congestion, and so moving to a five-day (in office) work week, when that happens, I would really encourage Amazon to maybe reconsider and give employees a little bit of flexibility during that time period,\u201d Avery said.\n\nBut there\u2019s no sign of that in advance of the five-day-a-week return to office starting January 2.\n\nJassy touted annual revenue numbers, which this year he said, \u201cshould be well north of $600 billion\u201d as part of the reason he\u2019s been with the company so long, 27 years. But he also wrote, \u201cThe biggest reason I\u2019m still here is our culture. Being so customer-focused is an inspiring part of it, but it\u2019s also the people we work with, the way we collaborate and invent when we\u2019re at our best\u201d\n\nAnd being in the office together, he wrote, makes it easier for teammates to learn, collaborate, brainstorm, and invent.\n\nJassy made it clear that working remotely, prior to the pandemic, was not a given and so they are now returning to in-office work until there are extenuating circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,\u201d .\n\n\u201cSeattle has a whole could really use the population to come bac. Some neighborhoods are really booming and other neighborhoods are really sparse and I would just like to see the whole city kind of fill in again,\u201d McClendon said.",

At Labor Tribune press time it was unclear whether the strike would extend into this week, or how big of an impact it would have on the delivery of Christmas packages.\n\nThree of the seven hubs participating in the strike are in Southern California. The other four are in Queens; Atlanta; San Francisco; and Skokie, Ill., near Chicago.\n\nVOTED TO UNIONIZE IN 2022\n\nThe largest group at Amazon represented by the union works at a Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8, which employs more than 5,000 people, the Teamsters said. Employees at the warehouse voted to unionize in 2022, but the company has yet to bargain with them and is challenging the election outcome.\n\nAmazon has hundreds of delivery hubs across the country, and 10 or more in some of the largest urban areas.\n\nThe Teamsters had set a deadline of Dec. 15 for Amazon to begin negotiating with the drivers and warehouse employees. It initiated the strike after Amazon failed to do so.\n\n\u201cIf your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon\u2019s insatiable greed. We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cThese greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they\u2019ve pushed workers to the limit and now they\u2019re paying the price. This strike is on them.\u201d\n\nOTHER ACTIONS\n\nTeamsters local unions are also putting up primary picket lines at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide. Amazon warehouse workers and drivers without collective bargaining agreements have the legal right to honor these picket lines by withholding their labor.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is historic,\u201d Leah Pensler, a warehouse worker at DCK6 in San Francisco, said in the release from the Teamsters. \u201cWe are fighting against a vicious union-busting campaign, and we are going to win.\u201d\n\n\u2018CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO PAY OUR BILLS\u2019\n\nAmazon is the second-largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list.

            "content": "The Amazon Rainforest, where next year\u2019s COP30 climate summit will be hosted, is reeling from two consecutive years of severe drought, with major rivers at record lows, leading to water shortages and transportation disruptions for local communities.\n\nWhile deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon plunged during that period, the rainforest remains under threat from land grabbing, illegal gold mining, diminishing rainfall, and outbreaks of fire, many of them ignited by criminals.\n\nThe world\u2019s greatest tropical rainforest has also drawn the interest of carbon traders, but evidence of fraud within some carbon credit projects unearthed by Mongabay highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the carbon market.\n\nAmid all these threats, reforestation and restoration projects led by Indigenous communities and conservation organizations offer hope for a sustainable future for the Amazon. See All Key Ideas\n\nIn just under a year from now, the world will turn to Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, a city on the edge of the Amazon Rainforest, for the COP30 United Nations climate summit. For many conservationists and diplomats, the hope is that the setting will inspire authorities to finally lead breakthroughs in the Paris Agreement and keep climate change under some degree of control. While hosting the summit in an Amazonian city carries significant political and symbolic weight, the location also underscores contradictions.\n\nAs the global spotlight shines on Bel\u00e9m, visitors and the world will be exposed to the Amazon\u2019s stark contradictions. They will witness the region\u2019s breathtaking beauty and crucial role in mitigating climate change. However, the city chosen to champion environmental action is grappling with unsustainable development projects to host the event.\n\nThis collision of ambition and reality will underscore the ongoing struggle between conservation efforts and the relentless pressures of economic development, land grabbing, and illegal activities that threaten the rainforest\u2019s delicate ecosystem.\n\nFor the past two years, the Amazon experienced consecutive extreme droughts, with 2024 being exceptionally severe, leaving major rivers at record lows. These phenomena reflect a combination of factors, including deforestation, climate change, and natural variability. The droughts have had cascading effects on local communities, disrupting transportation, fishing, and access to clean water.\n\nAdding to the crisis, fire outbreaks, many suspected to be criminal, have consumed an area of the rainforest larger than Costa Rica. The fires, fueled by dry conditions and human activity, released vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change, while the smoke they generated blanketed vast regions, impacting air quality and human health.\n\nWill the Amazon\u2019s climate return to normal in 2025 after two years of drought? Will the rains return, replenishing rivers and restoring ecosystems? Or has a drier climate become the new reality for the rainforest? Experts warn that the Amazon may be approaching its point of no return, as deforestation and forest degradation have already affected around 13% of the biome, according to the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), a U.S.-based nonprofit. The forests are drying out, making them more vulnerable to fires, with potentially irreversible damage looming. A report from World Weather Attribution (WWA) estimates that climate change increased the likelihood of Amazon droughts by a factor of 30.\n\nParadoxically, while the drought and fires rage, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, home to about two-thirds of the rainforest, has plunged recently. Deforestation rates in the country dropped by 30.6% over the past year, hitting the lowest level since 2015. This decline is attributed, in part, to heavier enforcement of environmental regulations. As a result, deforestation linked to garimpos, small-scale gold miners (often illegal), in the Amazon plummeted by 30% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nUnmasking new crimes\n\nIn recent years, the Amazon has seen a new type of shady business under the canopy: carbon credit projects. Several news outlets, including Mongabay, reported on suspicious carbon deals. An analysis commissioned by Mongabay revealed inconsistencies in timber volumes declared by carbon projects in Brazil that relied on forest management plans \u2014 systems in which timber is cut and sold under strict environmental regulations to ensure the area is monitored and illegal deforestation is avoided. These discrepancies suggested the projects may have issued fake documents to launder timber from illegally deforested areas.\n\nFollowing Mongabay\u2019s investigation, the Brazilian Federal Police launched a raid on these projects, resulting in arrests and asset seizures and confirming that these \u201cgreen\u201d projects were actually contributing to Amazonian deforestation.\n\nBesides shady carbon credit projects, another new topic on the crime front is the growing presence of criminal organizations in the rainforest. Those gangs operate at the nexus of drug trafficking, illegal logging and illegal mining, often collaborating with each other. They\u2019re highly organized and well-equipped groups, often with more resources and firepower than the authorities tasked with combating them.\n\nThe Javari Valley, on the triborder region of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, is beset by gangs that profit from drug trafficking, illegal logging and land grabbing. Two years after the murders there of journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, local communities still report feeling insecure, as organized crime continues to operate in the area.\n\nInvestigators say a transnational criminal organization involved in illegal poaching, money laundering and corruption is behind the murders.\n\nCriminal gangs have also established a network of clandestine airstrips within and around Indigenous communities and forest reserves to transport drugs and launder illegal timber. For example, in the Ucayali region of Peru, a Mongabay investigation found that drug traffickers have established 31 illegal airstrips, 13 of which are located within Indigenous territories and 13 surrounding them. This has led to violence and displacement as criminal groups seek to silence those who oppose their activities.\n\nThe convergence of these illegal activities has made it increasingly difficult for authorities to combat them effectively. Organized crime groups often outsource specific tasks, creating a fragmented network that\u2019s difficult to trace.\n\nThe presence of criminal organizations in the Amazon has devastating consequences for the environment, local communities and the rule of law. Deforestation, mercury contamination from illegal mining, and violence against Indigenous communities are just some of the impacts of these illegal activities. In the Yanomami Indigenous Territory, for example, the involvement of organized crime has led to an increase in sexual violence and drug trafficking. The lack of effective law enforcement and the complicity of corrupt officials further exacerbate the problem, allowing these criminal enterprises to flourish and continue their destructive practices with impunity.\n\nIn Brazil, the military not only failed to adequately protect these territories \u2014 it also effectively sabotaged efforts to evict invaders.\n\nPersistent threats\n\nAlongside new climate and crime challenges, the Amazon faces persistent threats from illegal activities and unsustainable development projects. Land grabbing remains a pervasive problem, with land grabbers often using fronts to conceal their activities, making it difficult to hold them accountable and allowing them to perpetuate their crimes.\n\nUsing front people, often relatives or trusted employees, to mask ownership of assets and evade legal repercussions is a widespread tactic these organizations employ. This practice makes it challenging to identify and hold the actual perpetrators accountable for environmental damage and human rights abuses.\n\nThese tactics allow land grabbers to clear vast tracts of rainforest for cattle ranching or soy plantations, driving deforestation and often violence.\n\nA year-long Mongabay investigation revealed a disturbing connection between the illegal cattle ranching boom in the Arariboia Indigenous Territory and a record-high number of killings of Indigenous Guajajara people. Arariboia is ostensibly protected from incursion by outsiders, but large plots of land inside the territory have been illegally used for cattle ranching. Our investigation uncovered a rise in environmental crimes in the region, including illegal deforestation and the construction of an unlicensed airstrip.\n\nAnalysis of satellite images, land leases and incident reports revealed a pattern of targeted killings of Indigenous Guajajara amid the expansion of illegal cattle ranching and logging. Our investigation found that many of the killings occurred in areas where police operations targeted illegal logging and areas embargoed due to unauthorized deforestation. While there\u2019s no evidence linking the owners of these businesses to the killings, the investigation\u2019s findings underscore the deadly consequences of the unchecked expansion of illegal activities within and around Indigenous territories.\n\nIllegal gold mining, driven by record-high global prices for the precious metal, continues to plague the Amazon, contaminating rivers with mercury and threatening Indigenous communities. In Itaituba, known as Brazil\u2019s \u201cgold capital,\u201d recent government crackdowns have been met with resistance from miners, as revealed by Mongabay. This struggle highlights the economic dependence of many communities on illegal activities, and the challenges in transitioning to more sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThese challenges arise directly from the global appetite for commodities like gold, soy and beef. Despite pledges to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, JBS, the world\u2019s largest meatpacking company, has been repeatedly accused of sourcing beef from illegally deforested areas. The demand for these commodities creates economic incentives that often outweigh environmental concerns, posing a significant obstacle to conservation efforts.\n\nAdding to these concerns are the Brazilian government\u2019s plans to develop new oil drilling sites in the Amazon and to pave a stretch of the BR-319 highway, topics likely to spark discussions in 2025 about rainforest conservation. State oil company Petrobras is pushing to explore an offshore oil site at the mouth of the Amazon. This project contradicts President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s campaign pledges to prioritize renewable energy and could severely impact Amazonian ecosystems. Meanwhile, the plan to pave the \u201cmiddle section\u201d of the BR-319 highway, connecting the cities of Porto Velho and Manaus, raises concerns about increased deforestation and the expansion of destructive industries into one of the best-preserved regions of the rainforest.\n\nResilience and restoration\n\nYet hope persists despite the challenges. In addition to plunging deforestation rates, reforestation and restoration projects are underway. In the Rio Pindar\u00e9 Indigenous Territory, the Guajajara people are restoring the forest along crucial headwaters, ensuring the future of rivers and streams. They collect healthy seedlings from the rainforest and transplant them to the springs, using traditional knowledge to restore the ecosystem.\n\nIn Amap\u00e1 state, communities in the Bailique archipelago in the mouth of the Amazon are adapting to the changing water dynamics. As fruits such as a\u00e7a\u00ed berries become saltier with the incursion of seawater from the Atlantic, locals are learning to catch rainwater and filter it for drinking, and planting a\u00e7a\u00ed palm trees farther from the riverbank to protect them from erosion. The community is also working with scientists to monitor the erosion and find ways to mitigate its effects.\n\nFurther inland, the Reconecta Project led by biologist Fernanda Abra is installing artificial bridges, or canopy bridges, over the BR-174 highway in the Waimiri-Atroari Indigenous Territory. These bridges allow arboreal mammals, such as monkeys and sloths, to safely cross the road, preventing them from being isolated in fragmented habitats. The project has successfully documented different species using the canopy bridges, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nBanner image: Emergent rainforest tree in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

The resulting text is then matched with one of Alexa\u2019s \u201cskills\u201d\u2014tasks which AVS is capable of performing (e.g., playing music on the Spotify application). As of 2023 Alexa has more than 130,000 skills.\n\nHistory Amazon Lab126, a subsidiary responsible for much of Amazon\u2019s research and development, secretly began development of a voice-controlled computer in 2011 under the code name Doppler. In order to obtain the data necessary to complete the project, the company acquired several small start-ups. One such company was the Polish start-up Ivona, which Amazon bought for $30 million in 2012 (a fact that the Amazon waited a year to announce). Ivona\u2019s speech-synthesizing program Spiker became the basis for Alexa. Originally, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wanted a voice-controlled computer to feature dozens of voices, with each one linked to a different set of tasks, but this ambition was not realized in the final version of Alexa. Instead, the team focused on developing just one voice, which they selected by writing out a list of desirable qualities, such as trustworthiness and warmth. Research suggested that such traits were most commonly associated with female voices, which is where the team focused its efforts. The voice eventually chosen is believed to belong to Nina Rolle, a voice actor and singer based in Boulder, Colorado, but neither Amazon nor Rolle have ever confirmed this. Once the voice actor was selected, her voice was recorded by an Atlanta-based voice-over studio called GM Voices, which had previously worked with Apple to create the voice of Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant. Giving Alexa a voice was in many ways an easier task for Alexa\u2019s creators; it was more challenging to enable Alexa (or rather, AVS) to listen. Teaching Alexa to recognize questions and commands required training the program on a large number of voice samples. To obtain this data, Amazon hired the Australian data collection firm Appen, which rented homes and apartments in which temp workers read canned lines and verbally responded to open-ended prompts such as, \u201cAsk to play your favorite song.\u201d Amazon's Echo Dot Although the cheaper Echo Dot has a less powerful speaker, Alexa can still perform the same functions as it would on a traditional Echo. (more) Amazon cautiously debuted the Amazon Echo in November 2014, initially offering only 80,000 devices\u2014and selling them only to customers who had signed up to purchase an Echo in advance (roughly 109,000 did). The company\u2019s wariness proved unnecessary as the Echo was an instant success. By the end of 2016 Amazon had sold more than eight million Echoes and Echo Dots (a smaller, cheaper version of the Echo); by 2019 the company had sold more than 100 million Alexa devices. At that point, Alexa was the top selling speaker company in the world. Get Unlimited Access Try Britannica Premium for free and discover more. Subscribe",
